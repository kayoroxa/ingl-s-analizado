Michael Joseph Jackson (August 29, 1958 – June 25, 2009) was an American singer, songwriter, dancer, and philanthropist. Dubbed the "King of Pop", he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century. Over a four-decade career, his contributions to music, dance, and fashion, along with his publicized personal life, made him a global figure in popular culture. Jackson influenced artists across many music genres; through stage and video performances, he popularized complicated dance moves such as the moonwalk, to which he gave the name, as well as the robot. He is the most awarded individual music artist in history.

The eighth child of the Jackson family, Jackson made his professional debut in 1964 with his older brothers Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, and Marlon as a member of the Jackson 5 (later known as the Jacksons). Jackson began his solo career in 1971 while at Motown Records. He became a solo star with his 1979 album Off the Wall. His music videos, including those for "Beat It", "Billie Jean", and "Thriller" from his 1982 album Thriller, are credited with breaking racial barriers and transforming the medium into an artform and promotional tool. He helped propel the success of MTV and continued to innovate with videos for the albums Bad (1987), Dangerous (1991), and HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I (1995). Thriller became the best-selling album of all time, while Bad was the first album to produce five U.S. Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles.[nb 1]

From the late 1980s, Jackson became a figure of controversy and speculation due to his changing appearance, relationships, behavior, and lifestyle. In 1993, he was accused of sexually abusing the child of a family friend. The lawsuit was settled out of civil court; Jackson was not indicted due to lack of evidence. In 2005, he was tried and acquitted of further child sexual abuse allegations and several other charges. The FBI found no evidence of criminal conduct on Jackson's behalf in either case. In 2009, while preparing for a series of comeback concerts, This Is It, Jackson died from an overdose of propofol administered by his personal physician, Conrad Murray, who was convicted in 2011 of involuntary manslaughter.

Jackson is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, with estimated sales of over 400 million records worldwide.[nb 2] He had 13 Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles (more than any other male artist in the Hot 100 era) and was the first artist to have a top-ten single in the Billboard Hot 100 in five different decades. He is regarded by the RIAA as the highest-selling individual music artist of all time worldwide. His honors include 15 Grammy Awards, 6 Brit Awards, a Golden Globe Award, and 39 Guinness World Records, including the "Most Successful Entertainer of All Time". Jackson's inductions include the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (twice), the Vocal Group Hall of Fame, the Songwriters Hall of Fame, the Dance Hall of Fame (the only recording artist to be inducted), and the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame. In 2016, his estate earned $825 million, the highest yearly amount for a celebrity ever recorded by Forbes.

Michael Joseph Jackson[9][10] was born in Gary, Indiana, on August 29, 1958.[11][12] He was the eighth of ten children in the Jackson family, a working-class African-American family living in a two-bedroom house on Jackson Street.[13][14] His mother, Katherine Esther Jackson (née Scruse), played clarinet and piano, had aspired to be a country-and-western performer, and worked part-time at Sears.[15] She was a Jehovah's Witness.[16] His father, Joseph Walter "Joe" Jackson, a former boxer, was a crane operator at U.S. Steel and played guitar with a local rhythm and blues band, the Falcons, to supplement the family's income.[17][18] Joe's great-grandfather, July "Jack" Gale, was a US Army scout; family lore held that he was also a Native American medicine man.[19] Michael grew up with three sisters (Rebbie, La Toya, and Janet) and five brothers (Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, Marlon, and Randy).[17] A sixth brother, Marlon's twin Brandon, died shortly after birth.[20]

In 1964, Michael and Marlon joined the Jackson Brothers—a band formed by their father which included Jackie, Tito, and Jermaine—as backup musicians playing congas and tambourine.[21][22] Michael said his father told him he had a "fat nose",[23] and physically and emotionally abused him during rehearsals. He recalled that Joe often sat in a chair with a belt in his hand as he and his siblings rehearsed, ready to punish any mistakes.[16][24] Joe acknowledged that he regularly whipped Michael.[25] Katherine said that although whipping came to be considered abuse, it was a common way to discipline children when Michael was growing up.[26][27] Jackie, Tito, Jermaine and Marlon denied that their father was abusive and said that the whippings, which were harder on Michael because he was younger, kept them disciplined and out of trouble.[28] Michael said his youth was lonely and isolated.[29]

Later in 1964, Michael began sharing lead vocals with Jermaine, and the group's name was changed to the Jackson 5.[30] In 1965, the group won a talent show; Michael performed the dance to Robert Parker's 1965 song "Barefootin'" and sang the Temptations' "My Girl".[31] From 1966 to 1968, the Jacksons 5 toured the Midwest; they frequently played at a string of black clubs known as the Chitlin' Circuit as the opening act for artists such as Sam & Dave, the O'Jays, Gladys Knight, and Etta James. The Jackson 5 also performed at clubs and cocktail lounges, where striptease shows were featured, and at local auditoriums and high school dances.[32][33] In August 1967, while touring the East Coast, they won a weekly amateur night concert at the Apollo Theater in Harlem.[34]

The Jackson 5 recorded several songs for a Gary record label, Steeltown Records; their first single, "Big Boy", was released in 1968.[36] Bobby Taylor of Bobby Taylor & the Vancouvers brought the Jackson 5 to Motown after they opened for Taylor at Chicago's Regal Theater in 1968. Taylor produced some of their early Motown recordings, including a version of "Who's Lovin' You".[37] After signing with Motown, the Jackson family relocated to Los Angeles.[38] In 1969, Motown executives decided Diana Ross should introduce the Jackson 5 to the public—partly to bolster her career in television—sending off what was considered Motown's last product of its "production line".[39] The Jackson 5 made their first television appearance in 1969 in the Miss Black America pageant, performing a cover of "It's Your Thing".[40] Rolling Stone later described the young Michael as "a prodigy" with "overwhelming musical gifts" who "quickly emerged as the main draw and lead singer".[41]

In January 1970, "I Want You Back" became the first Jackson 5 song to reach number one on the US Billboard Hot 100; it stayed there for four weeks. Three more singles with Motown topped the chart: "ABC", "The Love You Save", and "I'll Be There".[42] In May 1971, the Jackson family moved into a large house at Hayvenhurst, a two-acre estate in Encino, California.[43] During this period, Michael developed from a child performer into a teen idol.[44] Between 1972 and 1975, he released four solo studio albums with Motown: Got to Be There (1972), Ben (1972), Music & Me (1973), and Forever, Michael (1975).[45] "Got to Be There" and "Ben", the title tracks from his first two solo albums, sold well as singles, as did a cover of Bobby Day's "Rockin' Robin".[46]

Michael maintained ties to the Jackson 5.[45] The Jackson 5 were later described as "a cutting-edge example of black crossover artists".[47] They were frustrated by Motown's refusal to allow them creative input.[48] Jackson's performance of their top five single "Dancing Machine" on Soul Train popularized the robot dance.[49]

Move to Epic and Off the Wall (1975–1981)

The Jackson 5 left Motown in 1975, signing with Epic Records and renaming themselves the Jacksons.[50] Their younger brother Randy joined the band around this time; Jermaine stayed with Motown and pursued a solo career.[51] The Jacksons continued to tour internationally, and released six more albums between 1976 and 1984. Michael, the group's main songwriter during this time, wrote songs such as "Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)" (1978), "This Place Hotel" (1980), and "Can You Feel It" (1980).[52]

In 1977, Jackson moved to New York City to star as the Scarecrow in The Wiz, a musical film directed by Sidney Lumet, alongside Diana Ross, Nipsey Russell, and Ted Ross.[53] The film was a box-office failure.[54] Its score was arranged by Quincy Jones,[55] who later produced three of Jackson's solo albums.[56] During his time in New York, Jackson frequented the Studio 54 nightclub, where he heard early hip hop; this influenced his beatboxing on future tracks such as "Working Day and Night".[57] In 1978, Jackson broke his nose during a dance routine. A rhinoplasty led to breathing difficulties that later affected his career. He was referred to Steven Hoefflin, who performed Jackson's operations.[58]

Jackson's fifth solo album, Off the Wall (1979), established him as a solo performer and helped him move from the bubblegum pop of his youth to more complex sounds.[44] It produced four top 10 entries in the US: "Off the Wall", "She's Out of My Life", and the chart-topping singles "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough" and "Rock with You".[59] The album reached number three on the US Billboard 200 and sold over 20 million copies worldwide.[60] In 1980, Jackson won three American Music Awards for his solo work: Favorite Soul/R&B Album, Favorite Soul/R&B Male Artist, and Favorite Soul/R&B Single for "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough".[61][62] He also won a Grammy Award for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance for 1979 with "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough".[63] In 1981, Jackson was the American Music Awards winner for Favorite Soul/R&B Album and Favorite Soul/R&B Male Artist.[64] Jackson felt Off the Wall should have made a bigger impact, and was determined to exceed expectations with his next release.[65] In 1980, he secured the highest royalty rate in the music industry: 37 percent of wholesale album profit.[66]

Jackson recorded with Queen singer Freddie Mercury from 1981 to 1983, recording demos of "State of Shock", "Victory" and "There Must Be More to Life Than This". The recordings were intended for an album of duets but, according to Queen's manager Jim Beach, the relationship soured when Jackson brought a llama into the recording studio,[68] and Jackson was upset by Mercury's drug use.[69] The songs were released in 2014.[70] Jackson went on to record "State of Shock" with Mick Jagger for the Jacksons' album Victory (1984).[71] In 1982, Jackson contributed "Someone in the Dark" to the audiobook for the film E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. Jackson's sixth album, Thriller, was released in late 1982. It was the best-selling album worldwide in 1983,[72][73] and became the best-selling album of all time in the US[74] and the best-selling album of all time worldwide, selling an estimated 70 million copies.[75][76] It topped the Billboard 200 chart for 37 weeks and was in the top 10 of the 200 for 80 consecutive weeks. It was the first album to produce seven Billboard Hot 100 top-10 singles, including "Billie Jean", "Beat It", and "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'".[77]

On March 25, 1983, Jackson reunited with his brothers for Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever, an NBC television special. The show aired on May 16 to an estimated audience of 47 million, and featured the Jacksons and other Motown stars.[78] Jackson's solo performance of "Billie Jean" earned him his first Emmy Award nomination.[79] Wearing a glove decorated with rhinestones,[80] he debuted his moonwalk dance, which Jeffrey Daniel had taught him three years earlier, and it became his signature dance in his repertoire.[81] Jackson had originally turned down the invitation to the show, believing he had been doing too much television. But at the request of Motown founder Berry Gordy, he performed in exchange for an opportunity to do a solo performance.[82] Rolling Stone reporter Mikal Gilmore called the performance "extraordinary".[44] Jackson's performance drew comparisons to Elvis Presley's and the Beatles' appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show.[83] Anna Kisselgoff of The New York Times praised the perfect timing and technique involved in the dance.[84] Gordy described being "mesmerized" by the performance.[85]

At the 26th Annual Grammy Awards, Thriller won eight awards, and Jackson won an award for the E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial storybook. Winning eight Grammys in one ceremony is a record he holds with the band Santana.[63] Jackson and Quincy Jones won the award for Producer of the Year (Non-Classical). Thriller won Album of the Year (with Jackson as the album's artist and Jones as its co-producer), and the single won Best Pop Vocal Performance (Male) award for Jackson. "Beat It" won Record of the Year and Best Rock Vocal Performance (Male). "Billie Jean" won two Grammy awards: Best R&B Song and Best R&B Vocal Performance (Male), with Jackson as songwriter and singer respectively.[63] Thriller won the Grammy for Best Engineered Recording (Non Classical), acknowledging Bruce Swedien for his work on the album.[86] At the 11th Annual American Music Awards, Jackson won another eight awards and became the youngest artist to win the Award of Merit.[87] He also won Favorite Male Artist, Favorite Soul/R&B Artist, and Favorite Pop/Rock Artist. "Beat It" won Favorite Soul/R&B Video, Favorite Pop/Rock Video and Favorite Pop/Rock Single. The album won Favorite Soul/R&B Album and Favorite Pop/Rock Album.[87][88] Thriller's sales doubled after the release of an extended music video, Michael Jackson's Thriller, which sees Jackson dancing with a horde of zombies.[89][90]

The success transformed Jackson into a dominant force in global pop culture, and cemented his status as the "king of pop".[90] Jackson had the highest royalty rate in the music industry at that point, with about $2 for every album sold (equivalent to $5 in 2021), and was making record-breaking profits. Dolls modeled after Jackson appeared in stores in May 1984 for $12 each.[91] In the same year, The Making of Michael Jackson's Thriller, a documentary about the music video, won a Grammy for Best Music Video (Longform).[63] Time described Jackson's influence at that point as "star of records, radio, rock video. A one-man rescue team for the music business. A songwriter who sets the beat for a decade. A dancer with the fanciest feet on the street. A singer who cuts across all boundaries of taste and style and color too."[91] The New York Times wrote "in the world of pop music, there is Michael Jackson and there is everybody else".[92]

On May 14, 1984, President Ronald Reagan gave Jackson an award recognizing his support of alcohol and drug abuse charities,[93] and in recognition of his support for the Ad Council's and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Drunk Driving Prevention campaign. Jackson allowed the campaign to use "Beat It" for its public service announcements.[94]

Pepsi incident and other commercial activities (1984–1985)
In November 1983, Jackson and his brothers partnered with PepsiCo in a $5 million promotional deal that broke records for a celebrity endorsement (equivalent to $13,603,408 in 2021). The first Pepsi campaign, which ran in the US from 1983 to 1984 and launched its "New Generation" theme, included tour sponsorship, public relations events, and in-store displays. Jackson helped to create the advertisement, and suggested using his song "Billie Jean", with revised lyrics, as its jingle.[95]

On January 27, 1984, Michael and other members of the Jacksons filmed a Pepsi commercial overseen by Phil Dusenberry,[96] a BBDO ad agency executive, and Alan Pottasch, Pepsi's Worldwide Creative Director, at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. During a simulated concert before a full house of fans, pyrotechnics accidentally set Jackson's hair on fire, causing second-degree burns to his scalp. Jackson underwent treatment to hide the scars and had his third rhinoplasty shortly thereafter.[97] Pepsi settled out of court, and Jackson donated the $1.5 million settlement to the Brotman Medical Center in Culver City, California; its now-closed Michael Jackson Burn Center was named in his honor.[98][99] Jackson signed a second agreement with Pepsi in the late 1980s for $10 million. The second campaign covered 20 countries and provided financial support for Jackson's Bad album and 1987–88 world tour. Jackson had endorsements and advertising deals with other companies, such as LA Gear, Suzuki, and Sony, but none were as significant as his deals with Pepsi.[95]

The Victory Tour of 1984 headlined the Jacksons and showcased Jackson's new solo material to more than two million Americans. It was the last tour he did with his brothers.[100] Following controversy over the concert's ticket sales, Jackson donated his share of the proceeds, an estimated $3 to 5 million, to charity.[101] During the last concert of the Victory Tour at the Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, Jackson announced his split from The Jacksons during "Shake Your Body".[102] His charitable work continued with the release of "We Are the World" (1985), co-written with Lionel Richie,[103] which raised money for the poor in the US and Africa.[104] It earned $63 million (equivalent to $158,728,032 in 2021),[104] and became one of the best-selling singles of all time, with 20 million copies sold.[105] It won four Grammy Awards in 1985, including Song of the Year for Jackson and Richie as its writers.[103] The project's creators received two special American Music Awards honors: one for the creation of the song and another for the USA for Africa idea. Jackson, Jones, and promoter Ken Kragen received special awards for their roles in the song's creation.[103][106][107][108]

Jackson collaborated with Paul McCartney in the early 1980s, and learned that McCartney was making $40 million a year from owning the rights to other artists' songs.[104] By 1983, Jackson had begun buying publishing rights to others' songs, but he was careful with his acquisitions, only bidding on a few of the dozens that were offered to him. Jackson's early acquisitions of music catalogs and song copyrights such as the Sly Stone collection included "Everyday People" (1968), Len Barry's "1–2–3" (1965), and Dion DiMucci's "The Wanderer" (1961) and "Runaround Sue" (1961).

In 1984, Robert Holmes à Court announced he was selling the ATV Music Publishing catalog comprising the publishing rights to nearly 4,000 songs, including most of the Beatles' material.[109] In 1981, McCartney had been offered the catalog for £20 million ($40 million).[104][110] Jackson submitted a bid of $46 million on November 20, 1984.[109] When Jackson and McCartney were unable to make a joint purchase, McCartney did not want to be the sole owner of the Beatles' songs, and did not pursue an offer on his own.[111][110] Jackson's agents were unable to come to a deal, and in May 1985 left talks after having spent more than $1 million and four months of due diligence work on the negotiations.[109] In June 1985, Jackson and Branca learned that Charles Koppelman's and Marty Bandier's The Entertainment Company had made a tentative offer to buy ATV Music for $50 million; in early August, Holmes à Court contacted Jackson and talks resumed. Jackson's increased bid of $47.5 million (equivalent to $119,675,897 in 2021) was accepted because he could close the deal more quickly, having already completed due diligence.[109] Jackson agreed to visit Holmes à Court in Australia, where he would appear on the Channel Seven Perth Telethon.[112] His purchase of ATV Music was finalized on August 10, 1985.[104][109]

Increased tabloid speculation (1986–1987)
See also: Health and appearance of Michael Jackson
Jackson's skin had been medium-brown during his youth, but from the mid-1980s gradually grew paler. The change drew widespread media coverage, including speculation that he had been bleaching his skin.[113][114][115] His dermatologist, Arnold Klein, said he observed in 1983 that Jackson had vitiligo,[116] a condition characterized by patches of the skin losing their pigment, and sensitivity to sunlight. He also identified discoid lupus erythematosus in Jackson. He diagnosed Jackson with lupus that year,[116] and with vitiligo in 1986.[117] Vitiligo's drastic effects on the body can cause psychological distress. Jackson used fair-colored makeup,[118] and possibly skin-bleaching prescription creams,[119] to cover up the uneven blotches of color caused by the illness. The creams would have further lightened his skin, and, with the application of makeup, he could appear very pale.[120] Jackson said he had not purposely bleached his skin and could not control his vitiligo, adding, "When people make up stories that I don't want to be who I am, it hurts me."[121] He became friends with Klein and Klein's assistant, Debbie Rowe. Rowe later became Jackson's second wife and the mother of his first two children.[122]

In his 1988 autobiography and a 1993 interview, Jackson said he had had two rhinoplasty surgeries and a cleft chin surgery but no more than that. He said he lost weight in the early 1980s because of a change in diet to achieve a dancer's body.[123] Witnesses reported that he was often dizzy, and speculated he was suffering from anorexia nervosa. Periods of weight loss became a recurring problem later in his life.[124] After his death, Jackson's mother said that he first turned to cosmetic procedures to remedy his vitiligo, because he did not want to look like a "spotted cow". She said he had received more than the two cosmetic surgeries he claimed and speculated that he had become addicted to them.[125]

In 1986, tabloids reported that Jackson slept in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber to slow aging, and pictured him lying in a glass box. The claim was untrue, and tabloids reported that he spread the story himself.[126] They also reported that Jackson took female hormone shots to keep his voice high and facial hair wispy, proposed to Elizabeth Taylor and possibly had a shrine of her, and had cosmetic surgery on his eyes. Jackson's manager Frank DiLeo denied all of them, except for Jackson having a chamber. DiLeo added "I don't know if he sleeps in it. I'm not for it. But Michael thinks it's something that's probably healthy for him. He's a bit of a health fanatic."[127]

When Jackson took his pet chimpanzee Bubbles to tour in Japan, the media portrayed Jackson as an aspiring Disney cartoon character who befriended animals.[128] It was also reported that Jackson had offered to buy the bones of Joseph Merrick (the "Elephant Man").[129] In June 1987, the Chicago Tribune reported Jackson's publicist bidding $1 million for the skeleton to the London Hospital Medical College on his behalf. The college maintained the skeleton was not for sale. DiLeo said Jackson had an "absorbing interest" in Merrick, "purely based on his awareness of the ethical, medical and historical significance."[130]

These tabloid stories inspired the name "Wacko Jacko", which Jackson came to despise.[10][131] According to music journalist Joseph Vogel, the demeaning name first appeared in British tabloid The Sun in 1985. The name's origins come from Jacko Macacco, the name of a famous monkey used in monkey-baiting matches at the Westminster Pit in the early 1820s. "Jacko" was used in Cockney slang to refer to monkeys in general, hence a racist connotation behind the name.[132]

Jackson worked with George Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola on the 17-minute $30 million 3D film Captain EO, which ran from 1986 at Disneyland and Epcot, and later at Tokyo Disneyland and Euro Disneyland.[133] After having been removed in the late 1990s, it returned to the theme park for several years after Jackson's death.[134] In 1987, Jackson disassociated himself from the Jehovah's Witnesses.[135] Katherine Jackson said this might have been because some Witnesses strongly opposed the Thriller video.[136] Michael had denounced it in a Witness publication in 1984.[137]

Bad, autobiography, and Neverland (1987–1990)

Jackson's first album in five years, Bad (1987), was highly anticipated, with the industry expecting another major success.[138] It became the first album to produce five US number-one singles: "I Just Can't Stop Loving You", "Bad", "The Way You Make Me Feel", "Man in the Mirror", and "Dirty Diana". Another song, "Smooth Criminal", peaked at number seven.[59] Bad won the 1988 Grammy for Best Engineered Recording – Non Classical and the 1990 Grammy Award for Best Music Video, Short Form for "Leave Me Alone".[63][86] Jackson won an Award of Achievement at the American Music Awards in 1989 after Bad generated five number-one singles, became the first album to top the charts in 25 countries and the best-selling album worldwide in 1987 and 1988.[139][140] By 2012, it had sold between 30 and 45 million copies worldwide.[141][142]

The Bad world tour ran from September 12, 1987, to January 14, 1989.[143] In Japan, the tour had 14 sellouts and drew 570,000 people, nearly tripling the previous record for a single tour.[144] The 504,000 people who attended seven sold-out shows at Wembley Stadium set a new Guinness World Record.[145]

In 1988, Jackson released his autobiography, Moonwalk, with input from Stephen Davis and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.[146] It sold 200,000 copies,[147] and reached the top of the New York Times bestsellers list.[148] Jackson discussed his childhood, the Jackson 5, and the abuse from his father.[149] He attributed his changing facial appearance to three plastic surgeries, puberty, weight loss, a strict vegetarian diet, a change in hairstyle, and stage lighting.[150][123] In June, Jackson was honoured with the Grand Vermeil Medal of the City of Paris by the then Mayor of Paris Jacques Chirac during his stay in the city as part of the Bad world tour.[151][152] In October, Jackson released a film, Moonwalker, which featured live footage and short films starring Jackson and Joe Pesci. In the US it was released direct-to-video and became the best-selling video cassette in the country.[153][154] The RIAA certified it as eight times Platinum in the US.[155]

In March 1988, Jackson purchased 2,700 acres (11 km2) of land near Santa Ynez, California, to build a new home, Neverland Ranch, at a cost of $17 million (equivalent to $38,950,760 in 2021).[156] He installed a Ferris wheel, a carousel, a movie theater and a zoo.[156][157][158] A security staff of 40 patrolled the grounds.[157] Shortly afterwards, he appeared in the first Western television advertisement in the Soviet Union.[159]

Jackson became known as the "King of Pop", a nickname that Jackson's publicists embraced.[24][160][161] When Elizabeth Taylor presented him with the Soul Train Heritage Award in 1989, she called him "the true king of pop, rock and soul."[162] President George H. W. Bush designated him the White House's "Artist of the Decade".[163] From 1985 to 1990, Jackson donated $455,000 to the United Negro College Fund,[164] and all profits from his single "Man in the Mirror" went to charity.[165] His rendition of "You Were There" at Sammy Davis Jr.'s 60th birthday celebration won Jackson a second Emmy nomination.[79] Jackson was the bestselling artist of the 1980s.[166]

Dangerous and public social work (1991–1993)
In March 1991, Jackson renewed his contract with Sony for $65 million (equivalent to $129,317,127 in 2021), a record-breaking deal,[167] beating Neil Diamond's renewal contract with Columbia Records.[168] In 1991, he released his eighth album, Dangerous, co-produced with Teddy Riley.[169] It was certified eight times platinum in the US, and by 2018 had sold 32 million copies worldwide.[170][171] In the US, the first single, "Black or White", was the album's highest-charting song; it was number one on the Billboard Hot 100 for seven weeks and achieved similar chart performances worldwide.[172] The second single, "Remember the Time" peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart.[173] At the end of 1992, Dangerous was the best-selling album of the year worldwide and "Black or White" the best-selling single of the year worldwide at the Billboard Music Awards.[166] In 1993, he performed "Remember the Time" at the Soul Train Music Awards in a chair, saying he twisted his ankle during dance rehearsals.[174] In the UK, "Heal the World" made No. 2 on the charts in 1992.[175]


Jackson during the Dangerous World Tour in 1993. Dangerous has been recognized by writers as an influence on contemporary pop and R&B artists.[176]
Jackson founded the Heal the World Foundation in 1992. The charity brought underprivileged children to Jackson's ranch to use the theme park rides, and sent millions of dollars around the globe to help children threatened by war, poverty, and disease. That July, Jackson published his second book, Dancing the Dream, a collection of poetry. The Dangerous World Tour ran between June 1992 and November 1993 and grossed $100 million (equivalent to $187,583,506 in 2021); Jackson performed for 3.5 million people in 70 concerts, all of which were outside the US.[177] Part of the proceeds went to Heal the World Foundation.[178] Jackson sold the broadcast rights of the tour to HBO for $20 million, a record-breaking deal that still stands.[179]

Following the death of HIV/AIDS spokesperson and friend Ryan White, Jackson pleaded with the Clinton administration at Bill Clinton's inaugural gala to give more money to HIV/AIDS charities and research[180][181] and performed "Gone Too Soon", a song dedicated to White, and "Heal the World" at the gala.[182] Jackson visited Africa in early 1992; on his first stop in Gabon he was greeted by more than 100,000 people, some of them carrying signs that read "Welcome Home Michael",[183] and was awarded an Officer of the National Order of Merit from President Omar Bongo.[184][185] During his trip to Ivory Coast, Jackson was crowned "King Sani" by a tribal chief. He thanked the dignitaries in French and English, signed documents formalizing his kingship, and sat on a golden throne while presiding over ceremonial dances.[183]

In January 1993, Jackson performed at the Super Bowl XXVII halftime show in Pasadena, California. The NFL sought a big-name artist to keep ratings high during halftime following dwindling audience figures.[186][187] It was the first Super Bowl whose half-time performance drew greater audience figures than the game. Jackson played "Jam", "Billie Jean", "Black or White", and "Heal the World". Dangerous rose 90 places in the US albums chart after the performance.[113]

Jackson gave a 90-minute interview with Oprah Winfrey on February 10, 1993. He spoke of his childhood abuse at the hands of his father; he believed he had missed out on much of his childhood, and said that he often cried from loneliness. He denied tabloid rumors that he had bought the bones of the Elephant Man, slept in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber, or bleached his skin, and stated for the first time that he had vitiligo. After the interview, Dangerous re-entered the US albums chart in the top 10, more than a year after its release.[24][113]

In January 1993, Jackson won three American Music Awards: Favorite Pop/Rock Album (Dangerous), Favorite Soul/R&B Single ("Remember the Time"), and was the first to win the International Artist Award of Excellence.[188][189] In February, he won the "Living Legend Award" at the 35th Annual Grammy Awards in Los Angeles.[63] He attended the award ceremony with Brooke Shields.[190] Dangerous was nominated for Best Vocal Performance (for "Black or White"), Best R&B Vocal Performance ("Jam") and Best R&B Song ("Jam"), and Bruce Swedien and Teddy Riley won the Grammy for Best Engineered – Non Classical.[86]

First child sexual abuse accusations and first marriage (1993–1995)
Main article: 1993 child sexual abuse accusations against Michael Jackson
In August 1993, Jackson was accused of child sexual abuse by a 13-year-old boy, Jordan Chandler, and his father, Evan Chandler.[191] Jordan said he and Jackson had engaged in acts of kissing, masturbation and oral sex.[192] While Jordan's mother initially told police that she did not believe Jackson had molested him, her position wavered a few days later.[193][194] Evan was recorded discussing his intention to pursue charges, which Jackson used to argue that he was the victim of a jealous father trying to extort money.[194] Jackson's older sister La Toya accused him of being a pedophile;[195] she later retracted this, saying she had been forced into it by her abusive husband.[196] Police raided Jackson's home in August and found two legal large-format art books featuring young boys playing, running and swimming in various states of undress.[197] Jackson denied knowing of the books' content and claimed if they were there someone had to send them to him and he did not open them.[198] Jordan Chandler gave police a description of Jackson's genitals. A strip search was made, and the jurors felt the description was not a match.[199][200][201] In January 1994, Jackson settled with the Chandlers out of court for a reported total sum of $23 million.[202] The police never pressed criminal charges.[203] Citing a lack of evidence without Jordan's testimony, the state closed its investigation on September 22, 1994.[204]

Jackson had been taking painkillers for his reconstructive scalp surgeries, administered due to the Pepsi commercial accident in 1984, and became dependent on them to cope with the stress of the sexual abuse allegations.[205] On November 12, 1993, Jackson canceled the remainder of the Dangerous Tour due to health problems, stress from the allegations and painkiller addiction. He thanked close friend Elizabeth Taylor for support, encouragement and counsel. The end of the tour concluded his relationship with Pepsi Cola, which sponsored the tour.[206]

In late 1993, Jackson proposed to Lisa Marie Presley, daughter of Elvis Presley, over the phone.[207] They married in La Vega, Dominican Republic, in May 1994 by civil judge Hugo Francisco Álvarez Pérez.[208] The tabloid media speculated that the wedding was a publicity stunt to deflect Jackson's sexual abuse allegations and jump-start Presley's career as a singer.[209][208] Their marriage ended little more than a year later, and they separated in December 1995.[210] Presley cited "irreconcilable differences" when filing for divorce the next month and only sought to reclaim her maiden name as her settlement.[209][211] After the divorce, Judge Pérez said, "They lasted longer than I thought they would. I gave them a year. They lasted a year and a half."[208] In an October 2010 interview with talk-show host Oprah Winfrey, Presley revealed that she and Jackson had attempted to reconcile intermittently for four years following their divorce, and that she had travelled to different parts of the world in order to be with him.[212]

Jackson was set to compose music for the Sega Genesis video game Sonic the Hedgehog 3 (1994), but left the project around the time the sexual abuse allegations surfaced and went uncredited. Jackson was a Sonic the Hedgehog fan,[213] and had collaborated with Sega for the 1990 arcade game Moonwalker.[214] The reasons for Jackson's departure and whether his compositions remain in the released game have been the subject of debate. Sega Technical Institute director Roger Hector and Sonic the Hedgehog co-creator Naoto Ohshima said that Jackson's involvement was terminated and his music reworked following the allegations.[213][215] However, Jackson's musical director Brad Buxer and two other members of Jackson's team, Doug Grigsby III and Ciorocco Jones, said the music remained and that Jackson went uncredited because he was unhappy with how the Genesis replicated his music.[216] Sonic 3 producer Yuji Naka would later confirm in 2022 that Jackson had indeed composed some of the songs in the game and that the development team had visited his home, while expressing disappointment that his songs were replaced in the compilation game Sonic Origins (2022) allegedly due to a royalty dispute with Jackson's estate.[217]

HIStory, second marriage, and fatherhood (1995–1997)
In June 1995, Jackson released the double album HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I. The first disc, HIStory Begins, is a greatest hits album (reissued in 2001 as Greatest Hits: HIStory, Volume I). The second disc, HIStory Continues, contains 13 original songs and two cover versions. The album debuted at number one on the charts and has been certified for eight million shipments in the US.[218] It is the best-selling multi-disc album of all time, with 20 million copies (40 million units) sold worldwide.[172][219] HIStory received a Grammy nomination for Album of the Year.[63] The New York Times reviewed it as "the testimony of a musician whose self-pity now equals his talent".[220]

The first single from HIStory was "Scream/Childhood". "Scream", a duet with Jackson's youngest sister Janet, protests the media's treatment of Jackson during the 1993 child abuse allegations against him. The single reached number five on the Billboard Hot 100,[173] and received a Grammy nomination for "Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals".[63] The second single, "You Are Not Alone", holds the Guinness world record for the first song to debut at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.[221] It received a Grammy nomination for "Best Pop Vocal Performance" in 1995.[63]

In 1995 the Anti-Defamation League and other groups complained that "Jew me, sue me, everybody do me/ Kick me, kike me, don't you black or white me", the original lyrics of "They Don't Care About Us", were antisemitic. Jackson released a version with revised words.[222][223]

In late 1995, Jackson was admitted to a hospital after collapsing during rehearsals for a televised performance, caused by a stress-related panic attack.[224] In November, Jackson merged his ATV Music catalog with Sony's music publishing division, creating Sony/ATV Music Publishing. He retained ownership of half the company, earning $95 million up front (equivalent to $168,941,909 in 2021) as well as the rights to more songs.[225][226]

"Earth Song" was the third single released from HIStory, and topped the UK Singles Chart for six weeks over Christmas 1995.[175] It became the 87th-bestselling single in the UK.[227] At the 1996 Brit Awards, Jackson's performance of "Earth Song" was disrupted by Pulp singer Jarvis Cocker, who was protesting what Cocker saw as Jackson's "Christ-like" persona. Jackson said the stage invasion was "disgusting and cowardly".[228][229]

In 1996, Jackson won a Grammy for Best Music Video, Short Form, for "Scream" and an American Music Award for Favorite Pop/Rock Male Artist.[63][230] Jackson promoted HIStory with the HIStory World Tour, from September 7, 1996, to October 15, 1997. He performed 82 concerts in five continents, 35 countries and 58 cities to over 4.5 million fans, his most attended tour. It grossed $165 million.[143] During the tour, in Sydney, Australia, Jackson married Debbie Rowe, a dermatology assistant, who was six months pregnant with his first child.[231] Michael Joseph Jackson Jr. (commonly known as Prince) was born on February 13, 1997; his sister Paris-Michael Katherine Jackson was born a year later on April 3, 1998.[232] Jackson and Rowe divorced in 1999, and Rowe conceded custody of the children, with an $8 million settlement (equivalent to $14,639,832 in 2021). In 2004, after the second child abuse allegations against Jackson, she returned to court to reclaim custody. The suit was settled in 2006.[233]

In 1997, Jackson released Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mix, which contained remixes of singles from HIStory and five new songs. Worldwide sales stand at 6 million copies, making it the best-selling remix album of all time. It reached number one in the UK, as did the title track.[234] In the US, the album reached number 24 and was certified platinum.[170]

Label dispute and Invincible (1997–2002)
From October 1997 to September 2001, Jackson worked on his tenth solo album, Invincible, which cost $30 million to record.[235] In June 1999, Jackson joined Luciano Pavarotti for a War Child benefit concert in Modena, Italy. The show raised a million dollars for refugees of the Kosovo War, and additional funds for the children of Guatemala.[236] Later that month, Jackson organized a series of "Michael Jackson & Friends" benefit concerts in Germany and Korea. Other artists involved included Slash, The Scorpions, Boyz II Men, Luther Vandross, Mariah Carey, A. R. Rahman, Prabhu Deva Sundaram, Shobana, Andrea Bocelli, and Luciano Pavarotti. The proceeds went to the Nelson Mandela Children's Fund, the Red Cross and UNESCO.[237] From August 1999 to 2000, he lived in New York City at 4 East 74th Street.[238] At the turn of the century, Jackson won an American Music Award as Artist of the 1980s.[239] In 2000, Guinness World Records recognized him for supporting 39 charities, more than any other entertainer.[240]

In September 2001, two 30th Anniversary concerts were held at Madison Square Garden to mark Jackson's 30th year as a solo artist. Jackson performed with his brothers for the first time since 1984. The show also featured Mýa, Usher, Whitney Houston, Destiny's Child, Monica, Liza Minnelli, and Slash. The first show was marred by technical lapses, and the crowd booed a speech by Marlon Brando.[241] Almost 30 million people watched the television broadcast of the shows in November.[242] After the September 11 attacks, Jackson helped organize the United We Stand: What More Can I Give benefit concert at RFK Stadium in Washington, D.C. on October 21, 2001. Jackson performed "What More Can I Give" as the finale.[243]

The release of Invincible was preceded by a dispute between Jackson and his record label, Sony Music Entertainment. Jackson had expected the licenses to the masters of his albums to revert to him in the early 2000s, after which he would be able to promote the material however he pleased and keep the profits, but clauses in the contract set the revert date years into the future. Jackson sought an early exit from his contract.[244] Invincible was released on October 30, 2001. It was Jackson's first full-length album in six years, and the last album of original material he released in his lifetime.[244] It debuted at number one in 13 countries and went on to sell eight million copies worldwide, receiving double-platinum certification in the US.[170][245][246]


Jackson in 2003
On January 9, 2002, Jackson won his 22nd American Music Award for Artist of the Century.[247][248] Later that year, an anonymous surrogate mother gave birth to his third child, Prince Michael Jackson II (nicknamed "Blanket"), who had been conceived by artificial insemination.[249] On November 20, Jackson briefly held Blanket over the railing of his Berlin hotel room, four stories above ground level, prompting widespread criticism in the media. Jackson apologized for the incident, calling it "a terrible mistake".[250] On January 22, promoter Marcel Avram filed a breach of contract complaint against Jackson for failing to perform two planned 1999 concerts.[251] In March, a Santa Maria jury ordered Jackson to pay Avram $5.3 million.[252][253] On December 18, 2003, Jackson's attorneys dropped all appeals on the verdict and settled the lawsuit for an undisclosed amount.[254]

On April 24, 2002, Jackson performed at Apollo Theater. The concert was a fundraiser for the Democratic National Committee and former President Bill Clinton.[255] The money collected would be used to encourage citizens to vote. It raised $2.5 million.[256] The concert was called Michael Jackson: Live at the Apollo and was one of Jackson's final on-stage performances.[257]

In July 2002, Jackson called Sony Music chairman Tommy Mottola "a racist, and very, very, very devilish," and someone who exploits black artists for his own gain, at Al Sharpton's National Action Network in Harlem. The accusation prompted Sharpton to form a coalition investigating whether Mottola exploited black artists.[258] Jackson charged that Mottola had called his colleague Irv Gotti a "fat nigger".[259] Responding to those attacks, Sony issued a statement calling them "ludicrous, spiteful, and hurtful" and defended Mottola as someone who had championed Jackson's career for many years.[258] Sony ultimately refused to renew Jackson's contract and claimed that a $25 million promotional campaign had failed because Jackson refused to tour in the US for Invincible.[235]

Second child abuse allegations and acquittal (2002–2005)

Beginning in May 2002, a documentary film crew led by Martin Bashir followed Jackson for several months.[250] The documentary, broadcast in February 2003 as Living with Michael Jackson, showed Jackson holding hands and discussing sleeping arrangements with a 12-year-old boy.[23][260] He said that he saw nothing wrong with having sleepovers with minors and sharing his bed and bedroom with various people, which aroused controversy. He insisted that the sleepovers were not sexual and that his words had been misunderstood.[261][262]

In October 2003, Jackson received the Key to the City of Las Vegas from Mayor Oscar Goodman.[263] On November 18, 2003, Sony released Number Ones, a greatest hits compilation. It was certified five-times platinum by the RIAA, and nine times platinum in the UK, for shipments of at least 2.7 million units.[170][264]

On December 18, 2003, Santa Barbara authorities charged Jackson with seven counts of child molestation and two counts of intoxicating a minor with alcoholic drinks.[265] Jackson denied the allegations and pleaded not guilty.[266] The People v. Jackson trial began on January 31, 2005, in Santa Maria, California, and lasted until the end of May. Jackson found the experience stressful and it affected his health. If convicted, he would have faced up to 20 years in prison.[267] On June 13, 2005, Jackson was acquitted on all counts.[268] After the trial, he became reclusive[269] and moved to Bahrain as a guest of Sheikh Abdullah.[270] In December 2009, The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) released files on Michael Jackson. These files revealed the Bureau's role in the 2005 trial and the 1993 allegations against Jackson, among other revelations. The FBI found no evidence of criminal conduct on Jackson's behalf.[271][272]

Final years and This Is It (2006–2009)

In April 2006, Jackson agreed to use a piece of his ATV catalog stake, then worth about $1 billion, as collateral against his $270 million worth of loans from Bank of America. Bank of America had sold the loans to Fortress Investments, an investment company that buys distressed loans, the year before. As part of the agreement, Fortress Investments provided Jackson a new loan of $300 million with reduced interest payments (equivalent to $403,251,898 in 2021). Sony Music would have the option to buy half of his stake, or about 25% of the catalog, at a set price. Jackson's financial managers had urged him to shed part of his stake to avoid bankruptcy.[226][273] The main house at Neverland Ranch was closed as a cost-cutting measure, while Jackson lived in Bahrain at the hospitality of Sheik Abdullah, the ruler's son.[274] At least 30 of Jackson's employees had not been paid on time and were owed $306,000 in back wages; Jackson was ordered to pay $100,000 in penalties.[226]

In early 2006, it was announced that Jackson had signed a contract with a Bahrain-based startup, Two Seas Records; nothing came of the deal, and Two Seas CEO Guy Holmes later said it was never finalized.[275][276] That October, Fox News reported that Jackson had been recording at a studio in County Westmeath, Ireland. It was not known what Jackson was working on, or who had paid for the sessions; his publicist stated that he had left Two Seas by then.[276][277]

In November 2006, Jackson invited an Access Hollywood camera crew into the studio in Westmeath, and MSNBC reported that he was working on a new album, produced by will.i.am.[172] On November 15, Jackson briefly performed "We Are the World" at the World Music Awards in London and accepted the Diamond Award honoring the sale of over 100 million records. The event was Jackson's last public performance.[172][278] He returned to the U.S. in December 2006, settling in Las Vegas, and attended James Brown's funeral in Augusta, Georgia later that month, where he gave a eulogy calling Brown his greatest inspiration.[279]

In 2007, Jackson and Sony bought another music publishing company, Famous Music LLC, formerly owned by Viacom. The deal gave him the rights to songs by Eminem and Beck, among others.[280][281] In a brief interview with the Associated Press in Tokyo, Jackson said he had no regrets about his lifelong career despite difficulties and "deliberate attempts to hurt [him]".[282] That March, Jackson visited a US Army post in Japan, Camp Zama, to greet over 3,000 troops and their families.[283][284]

In September 2007, Jackson was still working on his next album, which he never completed.[285] For the 25th anniversary of Thriller in 2008, Jackson and Sony released Thriller 25, with two remixes released as singles: "The Girl Is Mine 2008" and "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin' 2008".[286] For Jackson's 50th birthday, Sony BMG released a series of greatest hits albums, King of Pop, with different tracklists for different regions.[287]

In 2008, Fortress Investments threatened to foreclose on Neverland Ranch, which Jackson had used as collateral for his loans. Fortress sold Jackson's debts to Colony Capital LLC.[288][289] In November, Jackson transferred Neverland Ranch's title to Sycamore Valley Ranch Company LLC, a joint venture between Jackson and Colony Capital LLC. The deal earned him $35 million.[290] Jackson arranged to sell a collection of his memorabilia of more than 1,000 items through Julien's Auction House. On the eve of the first public exhibit, Jackson canceled the auction after earning between $200 million to $300 million of initial sales from a series of concerts to be held in London.[291][269]

In March 2009, amid speculation about his finances and health, Jackson announced a series of comeback concerts, This Is It, at a press conference at The O2 Arena.[292] The shows were to be his first major concerts since the HIStory World Tour in 1997. Jackson suggested he would retire after the shows. The initial plan was for 10 concerts in London, followed by shows in Paris, New York City and Mumbai. Randy Phillips, president and chief executive of AEG Live, predicted the first 10 dates would earn Jackson £50 million.[293] The London residency was increased to 50 dates after record-breaking ticket sales; over one million were sold in less than two hours.[294] The concerts were to run from July 13, 2009, to March 6, 2010. Jackson moved to Los Angeles, where he rehearsed in the weeks leading up to the tour under the direction of choreographer Kenny Ortega, whom he had worked with during his previous tours. Rehearsals took place at the Forum and the Staples Center owned by AEG.[295]

Death

On June 25, 2009, less than three weeks before the first This Is It show was due to begin in London, with all concerts sold out, Jackson died from cardiac arrest, caused by a propofol and benzodiazepine overdose.[296][297] Conrad Murray, his personal physician, had given Jackson various medications to help him sleep at his rented mansion in Holmby Hills, Los Angeles. Paramedics received a 911 call at 12:22 pm Pacific time (19:22 UTC) and arrived three minutes later.[298][299] Jackson was not breathing and CPR was performed.[300] Resuscitation efforts continued en route to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, and for more than an hour after Jackson's arrival there, but were unsuccessful,[301][302] and Jackson was pronounced dead at 2:26 pm Pacific time (21:26 UTC).[303][304]

Jackson was administered propofol, lorazepam, and midazolam;[305] his death was caused by a propofol overdose.[297][302] News of his death spread quickly online, causing websites to slow down and crash from user overload,[306] and putting unprecedented strain[307] on services and websites including Google,[308] AOL Instant Messenger,[307] Twitter, and Wikipedia.[308] Overall, web traffic rose by between 11% and 20%.[309][310] MTV and BET aired marathons of Jackson's music videos,[311] and Jackson specials aired on television stations around the world.[312] MTV briefly returned to its original music video format,[11] and aired hours of Jackson's music videos, with live news specials featuring reactions from MTV personalities and other celebrities.[313]

Jackson's memorial was held on July 7, 2009, at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, preceded by a private family service at Forest Lawn Memorial Park's Hall of Liberty. Over 1.6 million fans applied for tickets to the memorial; the 8,750 recipients were drawn at random, and each received two tickets.[314] The memorial service was one of the most watched events in streaming history,[315] with an estimated US audience of 31.1 million[316] and a worldwide audience of an estimated 2.5 to 3 billion.[317]

Mariah Carey, Stevie Wonder, Lionel Richie, Jennifer Hudson, and Shaheen Jafargholi performed at the memorial, and Smokey Robinson and Queen Latifah gave eulogies.[318] Al Sharpton received a standing ovation with cheers when he told Jackson's children: "Wasn't nothing strange about your daddy. It was strange what your daddy had to deal with. But he dealt with it anyway."[319] Jackson's 11-year-old daughter Paris Katherine, speaking publicly for the first time, wept as she addressed the crowd.[320][321] The Rev. Lucious Smith provided a closing prayer.[322] Jackson's body was entombed on September 3, 2009, at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California.[323]

Criminal investigation and prosecution of Conrad Murray
Main article: People v. Murray
In August 2009, the Los Angeles County Coroner ruled that Jackson's death was a homicide.[324][325] Law enforcement officials charged Murray with involuntary manslaughter on February 8, 2010.[326] In late 2011, he was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter[327] and held without bail to await sentencing.[328] Murray was sentenced to four years in prison.[329]

At the 2009 American Music Awards, Jackson won four posthumous awards, including two for his compilation album Number Ones, bringing his total American Music Awards to 26.[330][331] In the year after his death, more than 16.1 million of Jackson's albums sold in the US and 35 million albums sold worldwide, more than any other artist in 2009.[332][333] He became the first artist to sell one million music downloads in a week, with 2.6 million song downloads. Thriller, Number Ones, and The Essential Michael Jackson became the first catalog albums to outsell any new album.[334] Jackson also became the first artist to have four of the top 20 best-selling albums in a single year in the US.[335]

Following the surge in sales, in March 2010, Sony Music signed a $250 million deal (equivalent to $310,659,240 in 2021) with the Jackson estate to extend their distribution rights to Jackson's back catalog until at least 2017; it had been due to expire in 2015. It was the most expensive music contract for a single artist in history.[336][337] They agreed to release ten albums of previously unreleased material and new collections of released work.[336][338] The deal was extended in 2017.[339] That July, a Los Angeles court awarded Quincy Jones $9.4 million of disputed royalty payments for Off the Wall, Thriller, and Bad.[56] In July 2018, Sony/ATV bought the estate's stake in EMI for $287.5 million.[340]

In 2014, Jackson became the first artist to have a top ten single in the Billboard Hot 100 in five different decades.[341] The following year, Thriller became the first album to be certified for 30 million shipments by the RIAA;[7] a year later, it was certified 33× platinum, after Soundscan added streams and audio downloads to album certifications.[342][nb 3]

Posthumous releases and productions
The first posthumous Jackson song, "This Is It", co-written in the 1980s with Paul Anka, was released in October 2009. The surviving Jackson brothers reunited to record backing vocals.[344] It was followed by a documentary film about the rehearsals for the canceled This Is It tour, Michael Jackson's This Is It,[345] and a compilation album.[346] Despite a limited two-week engagement, the film became the highest-grossing documentary or concert film ever, with earnings of more than $260 million worldwide.[347] Jackson's estate received 90% of the profits.[348] In late 2010, Sony released the first posthumous album, Michael, and the promotional single "Breaking News". Jackson collaborator will.i.am expressed disgust, saying that Jackson would not have approved the release.[349]

Video game developer Ubisoft released a music video game featuring Jackson for the 2010 holiday season, Michael Jackson: The Experience; it was among the first games to use Kinect and PlayStation Move, the motion-detecting camera systems for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.[350]

In April 2011, Mohamed Al-Fayed, chairman of Fulham Football Club, unveiled a statue of Jackson outside the club stadium, Craven Cottage.[351] It was moved to the National Football Museum in Manchester in May 2014,[352] and removed from display in March 2019 following renewed sexual assault allegations.[353]

In October 2011, the theater company Cirque du Soleil launched Michael Jackson: The Immortal World Tour, a $57-million production,[354] in Montreal, with a permanent show resident in Las Vegas.[355] A larger and more theatrical Cirque show, Michael Jackson: One, designed for residency at the Mandalay Bay resort in Las Vegas, opened on May 23, 2013, in a renovated theater.[356][357]

In 2012, in an attempt to end a family dispute, Jackson's brother Jermaine retracted his signature on a public letter criticizing executors of Jackson's estate and his mother's advisors over the legitimacy of his brother's will.[358] T.J. Jackson, son of Tito Jackson, was given co-guardianship of Michael Jackson's children after false reports of Katherine Jackson going missing.[359] Xscape, an album of unreleased material, was released on May 13, 2014.[360] A duet between Jackson and Justin Timberlake titled "Love Never Felt So Good" was released in 2014, making Jackson the first artist to have a top 10 single on the US Billboard Hot 100 in five different decades when the single reached number 9.[361] Later that year, Queen released a duet recorded with Jackson and Freddie Mercury in the 1980s.[70] A compilation album, Scream, was released on September 29, 2017.[362]

In November 2019, it was reported that a Jackson biopic, produced by Bohemian Rhapsody (2018) producer Graham King, was in the works, with the screenplay written by John Logan. Jackson's estate granted King the rights to his music and will work with King.[363] A jukebox musical, MJ the Musical, premiered on Broadway in 2022.[364] Actor Myles Frost won the 2022 Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical for his portrayal of Jackson.[365]

In 2013, choreographer Wade Robson filed a lawsuit alleging that Jackson had sexually abused him for seven years, beginning when he was seven years old (1989–1996).[366] In 2014, a case was filed by James Safechuck, alleging sexual abuse over a four-year period from the age of ten (1988–1992).[367][368][369] Both had testified in Jackson's defense during the 1993 allegations; Robson did so again in 2005.[370][371] In 2015, Robson's case against Jackson's estate was dismissed on the grounds of being filed too late. Safechuck's claim was also time-barred.[372] In 2017, it was ruled that Jackson's corporations could not be held accountable for his alleged past actions.[373][374] The rulings were appealed, and on October 20, 2020, Safechuck's lawsuit against Jackson's corporations was again dismissed, with the presiding judge ruling that there was no evidence that Safechuck had a relationship with Jackson's companies.[375][376][377] On April 26, 2021, Robson's case was dismissed because of a lack of supporting evidence that the defendants exercised control over Jackson.[378]

Robson and Safechuck described allegations in graphic detail in the documentary Leaving Neverland, released in March 2019.[379] Radio stations in New Zealand, Canada, the UK and the Netherlands removed Jackson's music from their playlists.[380][381][382] Jackson's family condemned the film as a "public lynching",[383] and the Jackson estate released a statement calling the film a "tabloid character assassination [Jackson] endured in life, and now in death".[384] Close associates of Jackson, such as Corey Feldman, Aaron Carter, Brett Barnes, and Macaulay Culkin, said that Jackson had not molested them.[385][386][387] Rebuttal documentaries, such as Square One: Michael Jackson, Neverland Firsthand: Investigating the Michael Jackson Documentary and Michael Jackson: Chase the Truth, presented information countering the claims suggested by Leaving Neverland.[388][389][390] Jackson's album sales increased following the documentary screenings.[391] Billboard senior editor Gail Mitchell said she and a colleague interviewed about thirty music executives who believed Jackson's legacy could withstand the controversy.[392] In late 2019, some New Zealand and Canadian radio stations re-added Jackson's music to their playlists, citing "positive listener survey results".[393][394]

On February 21, 2019, the Jackson estate sued HBO for breaching a non-disparagement clause from a 1992 contract. The suit sought to compel HBO to participate in a non-confidential arbitration that could result in $100 million or more in damages rewarded to the estate.[395] HBO said they did not breach a contract and filed an anti-SLAPP motion against the estate. In September 2019, Judge George H. Wu denied HBO's motion to dismiss the case, allowing the Jackson estate to arbitrate.[396] HBO appealed, but in December 2020 the appeals court affirmed Wu's ruling.[397]

Jackson has been referred to as the "King of Pop" for having transformed the art of music videos and paving the way for modern pop music. For much of Jackson's career, he had an unparalleled worldwide influence over the younger generation.[223] His influence extended beyond the music industry; he impacted dance, led fashion trends, and raised awareness for global affairs.[398] Jackson's music and videos fostered racial diversity in MTV's roster and steered its focus from rock to pop music and R&B, shaping the channel into a form that proved enduring.[44] In songs such as "Man in the Mirror", "Black or White", Heal the World, "Earth Song" and "They Don't Care About Us", Jackson's music emphasized racial integration and environmentalism and protested injustice.[399][400] He is recognized as the Most Successful Entertainer of All Time by Guinness World Records.[401][402] He is considered one of the most significant cultural icons of the 20th century,[403] and his contributions to music, dance, and fashion, along with his publicized personal life, made him a global figure in popular culture for over four decades.[404][405][406]
Trying to trace Michael Jackson's influence on the pop stars that followed him is like trying to trace the influence of oxygen and gravity. So vast, far-reaching and was his impact—particularly in the wake of Thriller's colossal and heretofore unmatched commercial success—that there weren't a whole lot of artists who weren't trying to mimic some of the Jackson formula.

— J. Edward Keyes of Rolling Stone[407]
Danyel Smith, chief content officer of Vibe Media Group and the editor-in-chief of Vibe, described Jackson as "the Greatest Star".[408] Steve Huey of AllMusic called him "an unstoppable juggernaut, possessed of all the skills to dominate the charts seemingly at will: an instantly identifiable voice, eye-popping dance moves, stunning musical versatility and loads of sheer star power".[10] BET said Jackson was "quite simply the greatest entertainer of all time" whose "sound, style, movement and legacy continues to inspire artists of all genres".[409]

In 1984, Time pop critic Jay Cocks wrote that "Jackson is the biggest thing since the Beatles. He is the hottest single phenomenon since Elvis Presley. He just may be the most popular black singer ever." He described Jackson as a "star of records, radio, rock video. A one-man rescue team for the music business. A songwriter who sets the beat for a decade. A dancer with the fanciest feet on the street. A singer who cuts across all boundaries of taste and style, and color too."[91] In 2003, The Daily Telegraph writer Tom Utley described Jackson as "extremely important" and a "genius".[410] At Jackson's memorial service on July 7, 2009, Motown founder Berry Gordy called Jackson "the greatest entertainer that ever lived".[411][412] In a June 28, 2009 Baltimore Sun article, Jill Rosen wrote that Jackson's legacy influenced fields including sound, dance, fashion, music videos and celebrity.[413]

Pop critic Robert Christgau wrote that Jackson's work from the 1970s to the early 1990s showed "immense originality, adaptability, and ambition" with "genius beats, hooks, arrangements, and vocals (though not lyrics)", music that "will stand forever as a reproach to the puritanical notion that pop music is slick or shallow and that's the end of it". During the 1990s, as Jackson lost control of his "troubling life", his music suffered and began to shape "an arc not merely of promise fulfilled and outlived, but of something approaching tragedy: a phenomenally ebullient child star tops himself like none before, only to transmute audibly into a lost weirdo".[414] In the 2000s, Christgau wrote: "Jackson's obsession with fame, his grotesque life magnified by his grotesque wealth, are such an offense to rock aesthetes that the fact that he's a great musician is now often forgotten".[415]

Philanthropy and humanitarian work
Main article: Philanthropy of Michael Jackson
Jackson is regarded as a prolific philanthropist and humanitarian.[416][417][418][419] Jackson's early charitable work has been described by The Chronicle of Philanthropy as having "paved the way for the current surge in celebrity philanthropy",[420] and by the Los Angeles Times as having "set the standard for generosity for other entertainers".[416] By some estimates, he donated over $500 million, not accounting for inflation, to various charities over the course of his life.[416] The total monetary value of Jackson's donations may be substantially higher since Jackson often gave anonymously and without fanfare. In addition to supporting several charities established by others, in 1992 Jackson established his Heal the World Foundation, to which he donated several million dollars in revenue from his Dangerous World Tour.[421]

Jackson's philanthropic activities went beyond just monetary donations. He also performed at benefit concerts, some of which he arranged. He gifted tickets for his regular concert performances to groups that assist underprivileged children. He visited sick children in hospitals around the world. He opened his own home for visits by underprivileged or sick children and provided special facilities and nurses if the children needed that level of care.

Jackson donated valuable, personal and professional paraphernalia for numerous charity auctions. He received various awards and accolades for his philanthropic work, including two bestowed by Presidents of the United States. The vast breadth of Jackson's philanthropic work has earned recognition in the Guinness World Records.[416][422][423]

Jackson was influenced by musicians including James Brown, Little Richard, Jackie Wilson, Diana Ross, Fred Astaire, Sammy Davis Jr., Gene Kelly,[424] and David Ruffin.[425] Little Richard had a substantial influence on Jackson,[426] but Brown was his greatest inspiration; he later said that as a small child, his mother would wake him whenever Brown appeared on television. Jackson described being "mesmerized".[427]

Jackson's vocal technique was influenced by Diana Ross; his use of the oooh interjection from a young age was something Ross had used on many of her songs with the Supremes.[428] She was a mother figure to him, and he often watched her rehearse.[429] He said he had learned a lot from watching how she moved and sang, and that she had encouraged him to have confidence in himself.[430]

Choreographer David Winters, who met Jackson while choreographing the 1971 Diana Ross TV special Diana!, said that Jackson watched the musical West Side Story almost every week, and it was his favorite film; he paid tribute to it in "Beat It" and the "Bad" video.[431][432][433]

Vocal style
Jackson sang from childhood, and over time his voice and vocal style changed. Between 1971 and 1975, his voice descended from boy soprano to high tenor.[434] He was known for his vocal range.[435] With the arrival of Off the Wall in the late 1970s, Jackson's abilities as a vocalist were well regarded; Rolling Stone compared his vocals to the "breathless, dreamy stutter" of Stevie Wonder, and wrote that "Jackson's feathery-timbred tenor is extraordinarily beautiful. It slides smoothly into a startling falsetto that's used very daringly."[436] By the time of 1982's Thriller, Rolling Stone wrote that Jackson was singing in a "fully adult voice" that was "tinged by sadness".[437]

The turn of the 1990s saw the release of the introspective album Dangerous. The New York Times noted that on some tracks, "he gulps for breath, his voice quivers with anxiety or drops to a desperate whisper, hissing through clenched teeth" and he had a "wretched tone". When singing of brotherhood or self-esteem the musician would return to "smooth" vocals.[438] Of Invincible, Rolling Stone wrote that, at 43, Jackson still performed "exquisitely voiced rhythm tracks and vibrating vocal harmonies".[439] Joseph Vogel notes Jackson's ability to use non-verbal sounds to express emotion.[440] Neil McCormick wrote that Jackson's unorthodox singing style "was original and utterly distinctive".[441]

Musicianship
Jackson had no formal music training and could not read or write music notation. He is credited for playing guitar, keyboard, and drums, but was not proficient in them.[442] When composing, he recorded ideas by beatboxing and imitating instruments vocally.[442] Describing the process, he said: "I'll just sing the bass part into the tape recorder. I'll take that bass lick and put the chords of the melody over the bass lick and that's what inspires the melody." Engineer Robert Hoffman recalled that after Jackson came in with a song he had written overnight, Jackson sang every note of every chord to a guitar player. Hoffman also remembered Jackson singing string arrangements part by part into a cassette recorder.[442]


Dance
Jackson danced from a young age as part of the Jackson 5,[443] and incorporated dance extensively in his performances and music videos.[443] According to Sanjoy Roy of The Guardian, Jackson would "flick and retract his limbs like switchblades, or snap out of a tornado spin into a perfectly poised toe-stand".[443] The moonwalk, taught to him by Jeffrey Daniel,[81] was Jackson's signature dance move and one of the most famous of the 20th century.[444] Jackson is credited for coining the name "moonwalk"; the move was previously known as the "backslide".[445][446] His other moves included the robot,[49] crotch grab, and the "anti-gravity" lean of the "Smooth Criminal" video.[443]

Themes and genres

Jackson explored genres including pop,[10][447] soul,[10][157] rhythm and blues,[447] funk,[448] rock,[447][448] disco,[449] post-disco,[448] dance-pop[450] and new jack swing.[10] Steve Huey of AllMusic wrote that Thriller refined the strengths of Off the Wall; the dance and rock tracks were more aggressive, while the pop tunes and ballads were softer and more soulful.[10] Its tracks included the ballads "The Lady in My Life", "Human Nature", and "The Girl Is Mine",[451][437][452] the funk pieces "Billie Jean" and "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'",[451][437] and the disco set "Baby Be Mine" and "P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)".[452]

With Off the Wall, Jackson's "vocabulary of grunts, squeals, hiccups, moans, and asides" vividly showed his maturation into an adult, Robert Christgau wrote in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981). The album's title track suggested to the critic a parallel between Jackson and Stevie Wonder's "oddball" music personas: "Since childhood his main contact with the real world has been on stage and in bed."[453] With Thriller, Christopher Connelly of Rolling Stone commented that Jackson developed his long association with the subliminal theme of paranoia and darker imagery.[437] AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted this on the songs "Billie Jean" and "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'".[451] In "Billie Jean", Jackson depicts an obsessive fan who alleges he has fathered her child,[10] and in "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'" he argues against gossip and the media.[437] "Beat It" decried gang violence in a homage to West Side Story, and was Jackson's first successful rock cross-over piece, according to Huey.[10][41] He observed that "Thriller" began Jackson's interest with the theme of the supernatural, a topic he revisited in subsequent years. In 1985, Jackson co-wrote the charity anthem "We Are the World"; humanitarian themes later became a recurring theme in his lyrics and public persona.[10]

In Bad, Jackson's concept of the predatory lover is seen on the rock song "Dirty Diana".[458] The lead single "I Just Can't Stop Loving You" is a traditional love ballad, and "Man in the Mirror" is a ballad of confession and resolution. "Smooth Criminal" is an evocation of bloody assault, rape and likely murder.[138] AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine states that Dangerous presents Jackson as a paradoxical person.[459] The first half of the record is dedicated to new jack swing, including songs like "Jam" and "Remember the Time". It was the first Jackson album in which social ills became a primary theme; "Why You Wanna Trip on Me", for example, protests world hunger, AIDS, homelessness and drugs. Dangerous contains sexually charged songs such as "In the Closet". The title track continues the theme of the predatory lover and compulsive desire. The second half includes introspective, pop-gospel anthems such as "Will You Be There", "Heal the World" and "Keep the Faith".[438] In the ballad "Gone Too Soon", Jackson gives tribute to Ryan White and the plight of those with AIDS.[460]

HIStory creates an atmosphere of paranoia.[461] In the new jack swing-funk rock tracks "Scream" and "Tabloid Junkie", and the R&B ballad "You Are Not Alone", Jackson retaliates against the injustice and isolation he feels, and directs his anger at the media.[462] In the introspective ballad "Stranger in Moscow", Jackson laments his "fall from grace"; "Earth Song", "Childhood", "Little Susie" and "Smile" are operatic pop songs.[461][462] In "D.S.", Jackson attacks lawyer Thomas W. Sneddon Jr., who had prosecuted him in both child sexual abuse cases; he describes Sneddon as a white supremacist who wanted to "get my ass, dead or alive".[463] Invincible includes urban soul tracks such as "Cry" and "The Lost Children", ballads such as "Speechless", "Break of Dawn", and "Butterflies" and mixes hip hop, pop, and R&B in "2000 Watts", "Heartbreaker" and "Invincible".[464][465]

Jackson released "Thriller", a 14-minute music video directed by John Landis, in 1983.[466] The zombie-themed video "defined music videos and broke racial barriers" on MTV, which had launched two years earlier.[44] Before Thriller, Jackson struggled to receive coverage on MTV, allegedly because he was African American.[467] Pressure from CBS Records persuaded MTV to start showing "Billie Jean" and later "Beat It", which led to a lengthy partnership with Jackson, and helped other black music artists gain recognition.[468] The popularity of his videos on MTV helped the relatively new channel's viewing figures, and MTV's focus shifted toward pop and R&B.[468][469] His performance on Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever changed the scope of live stage shows, making it acceptable for artists to lip-sync to music video on stage.[470] The choreography in Thriller has been copied in Indian films and prisons in the Philippines.[471] Thriller marked an increase in scale for music videos, and was named the most successful music video ever by the Guinness World Records.[221]

In "Bad"'s 19-minute video—directed by Martin Scorsese—Jackson used sexual imagery and choreography, and touched his chest, torso and crotch. When asked by Winfrey in the 1993 interview about why he grabbed his crotch, he said it was spontaneously compelled by the music. Time magazine described the "Bad" video as "infamous". It featured Wesley Snipes; Jackson's later videos often featured famous cameo roles.[472][473] For the "Smooth Criminal" video, Jackson experimented with leaning forward at a 45 degree angle, beyond the performer's center of gravity. To accomplish this live, Jackson and designers developed a special shoe to lock the performer's feet to the stage, allowing them to lean forward. They were granted U.S. Patent 5,255,452 for the device.[474] The video for "Leave Me Alone" was not officially released in the US, but in 1989 was nominated for three Billboard Music Video Awards[475] and won a Golden Lion Award for its special effects. It won a Grammy for Best Music Video, Short Form.[63]

He received the MTV Video Vanguard Award in 1988; in 2001 the award was renamed in his honor.[476] The "Black or White" video simultaneously premiered on November 14, 1991, in 27 countries with an estimated audience of 500 million people, the largest audience ever for a music video at the time.[172] Along with Jackson, it featured Macaulay Culkin, Peggy Lipton, and George Wendt. It helped introduce morphing to music videos.[477] It was controversial for scenes in which Jackson rubs his crotch, vandalizes cars, and throws a garbage can through a storefront. He apologized and removed the final scene of the video.[161]

"In the Closet" featured Naomi Campbell in a courtship dance with Jackson.[478] "Remember the Time" was set in ancient Egypt, and featured Eddie Murphy, Iman, and Magic Johnson.[479] The video for "Scream", directed by Mark Romanek and production designer Tom Foden, gained a record 11 MTV Video Music Award Nominations, and won "Best Dance Video", "Best Choreography", and "Best Art Direction".[480] The song and its video are Jackson's response to being accused of child molestation in 1993.[481] A year later, it won a Grammy for Best Music Video, Short Form. It has been reported as the most expensive music video ever made, at $7 million;[482] Romanek has contradicted this.[483] The "Earth Song" video was nominated for the 1997 Grammy for Best Music Video, Short Form.[484]

Michael Jackson's Ghosts, a short film written by Jackson and Stephen King and directed by Stan Winston, premiered at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival. At over 38 minutes long, it held the Guinness world record for the longest music video until 2013, when it was eclipsed by the video for the Pharrell Williams song "Happy".[485] The 2001 video for "You Rock My World" lasts over 13 minutes, was directed by Paul Hunter, and features Chris Tucker and Marlon Brando.[486] It won an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Music Video in 2002.[487]

In December 2009, the Library of Congress selected "Thriller" as the only music video to be preserved in the National Film Registry, as a work of "enduring importance to American culture".[488][489] Huey wrote that Jackson transformed the music video into an artform and a promotional tool through complex story lines, dance routines, special effects and famous cameos, while breaking down racial barriers.[10]

In 1989, Jackson's annual earnings from album sales, endorsements, and concerts were estimated at $125 million.[221] Forbes placed Jackson's annual income at $35 million in 1996 and $20 million in 1997.[514] Estimates of Jackson's net worth during his life range from negative $285 million to positive $350 million for 2002, 2003 and 2007.[515][516] Forbes reported in August 2018 that Jackson's total career pretax earnings in life and death were $4.2 billion.[517][518] Sales of his recordings through Sony's music unit earned him an estimated $300 million in royalties. He may have earned another $400 million from concerts, music publishing (including his share of the Beatles catalog), endorsements, merchandising and music videos.[519]

In 2013, the executors of Jackson's estate filed a petition in the United States Tax Court as a result of a dispute with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) over US federal estate taxes.[520] The executors claim that it was worth about $7 million, the IRS that it was worth over $1.1 billion. In February 2014, the IRS reported that Jackson's estate owed $702 million; $505 million in taxes, and $197 million in penalties.[521] A trial was held from February 6 to 24, 2017.[522] In 2021, the Tax Court issued a ruling in favor of the estate, ruling that the estate's total combined value of the estate was $111.5 million and that the value of Jackson's name and likeness was $4 million (not the $61 million estimated by the IRS's outside expert witness).[523]

In 2016, Forbes estimated annual gross earnings by the Jackson Estate at $825 million, the largest ever recorded for a celebrity, mostly due to the sale of the Sony/ATV catalog.[524] In 2018, the figure was $400 million.[525] It was the eighth year since his death that Jackson's annual earnings were reported to be over $100 million, thus bringing Jackson's postmortem total to $2.4 billion.[526] In 2020, Forbes recognized Jackson as the top-earning dead celebrity each year since his death except 2012.[527][528]

IN THE NAME OF ALLAH THE MOST BENEFICENT AND MERCIFUL
As Salamo Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barkatahu,
I am thankful to Allah for giving me the opportunity to compile many of my favorite
Moral Stories, in the form of an electronic book, which I had collected from various
resources, since last few years. Even though many of these stories are fictional in
nature, but at the end they will give a great lesson to learn for a lifetime.
As the reader can himself see from these stories, the subject “Moral” is universal to
every human being. Hence these stories are not just for any particular sect or the
followers of particular faith, it is for the entire humanity, irrespective of there belief,
culture, race, color or age. So, let's start with a Moral Story called as “A POND FULL
OF MILK.”
Once there was a king who told some of his workers to dig a pond. Once the pond was
dug, the king made an announcement to his people saying that one person from each
household has to bring a glass of milk during the night and pour it into the pond. So,
the pond should be full of milk by the morning. After receiving the order, everyone
went home.
One man prepared to take the milk during the night. He thought that since everyone
will bring milk, he could just hide a glass of water and pour inside the pond. Because it
will be dark at night, no one will notice. So he quickly went and poured the water in the
pond and came back. In the morning, the king came to visit the pond and to his
surprise the pond was only filled with water! What has happened is that everyone was
thinking like the other man that “I don't have to put the milk, someone else will do it.”
Dear friends, when it comes to help the Religion of Allah, do not think that others will
take care of it. Rather, it starts from you, if you don't do it, no one else will do it. So,
change yourself to the way of Allah to serve Him and that will make the difference.
With this I will end my little introduction and pray that
May Almighty Allah accept it. So that we may all benefit
from these stories.
Wassalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmutallahi Wa Barkatahu

100 Moral Stories 3 www.islamicoccasions.com
Once upon a time, there was a king who ruled a prosperous country. One day, he went for a trip to
some distant areas of his country. When he was back to his palace, he complained that his feet were
very painful, because it was the first time that he went for such a long trip, and the road that he
went through was very rough and stony. He then ordered his people to cover every road of the
entire country with leather.
Definitely, this would need thousands of cows' skin, and would cost a
huge amount of money.
Then one of his wise servants dared himself to tell the king, “Why do
you have to spend that unnecessary amount of money? Why don't you
just cut a little piece of leather to cover your feet?”
The king was surprised, but he later agreed to his suggestion, to make
a “shoe” for himself.
There is actually a valuable lesson of life in this story: to make this world a happy
place to live, you better change yourself - your heart; and not the world.
THE TRAVELERS AND THE PLANE TREE
Two men were walking along one summer day. Soon it
became too hot to go any further and, seeing a large
plane tree nearby, they threw themselves on the
ground to rest in its shade.
Gazing up into the branches one man said to the other:
“What a useless tree this is. It does not have fruit or
nuts that we can eat and we cannot even use its
wood for anything.”
“Don't be so ungrateful,” rustled the tree in reply.
“I am being extremely useful to you at this very
moment, shielding you from the hot sun.
And you call me a good-for-nothing!”
All of God's creations have a good purpose.
Islam teaches us that we should never belittle Allah's blessings.
LEARN FROM MISTAKES
Thomas Edison tried two thousand different materials in search of a filament for
the light bulb. When none worked satisfactorily, his assistant complained,
“All our work is in vain. We have learned nothing.”
Edison replied very confidently, “Oh, we have come a long way and we have
learned a lot. We now know that there are two thousand elements which we
cannot use to make a good light bulb.”
DON'T CHANGE THE WORLD
100 Moral Stories 4 www.islamicoccasions.com
Once there was a shepherd boy who had to look after a flock of
sheep. One day, he felt bored and decided to play a trick on the
villagers. He shouted, “Help! Wolf! Wolf!”
The villagers heard his cries and rushed out of the village to help
the shepherd boy. When they reached him, they asked,
“Where is the wolf?”
The shepherd boy laughed loudly, “Ha, Ha, Ha! I fooled all of you.
I was only playing a trick on you.”
A few days later, the shepherd boy played this trick again.
Again he cried, “Help! Help! Wolf! Wolf!” Again, the villagers rushed up the hill to help him and
again they found that boy had tricked them. They were very angry with him for being so naughty.
Then, some time later, a wolf went into the field. The wolf attacked one sheep, and then another
and another. The shepherd boy ran towards the village shouting, “Help! Help! Wolf! Help!
Somebody!”
The villagers heard his cries but they laughed because they thought it was another trick. The boy
ran to the nearest villager and said, “A wolf is attacking the sheep. I lied before, but this time it is
true!”
Finally, the villagers went to look. It was true. They could see the wolf running away and many
dead sheep lying on the grass.
We may not believe someone who often tells lies, even when he tells the truth.
THE FARMER AND THE STORK
Finding that cranes were destroying his newly sown corn, a farmer
one evening set a net in his field to catch the destructive birds.
When he went to examine the net next morning he found
a number of cranes and also a stork.
“Release me, I beseech you,” cried the stork, “for I have eaten none of
your corn, nor have I done you any harm. I am a poor innocent stork,
as you may see - a most dutiful bird, I honor my father and mother.
I...”
But the farmer cut him short. “All this may be true enough, I dare say,
but I have caught you with those were destroying my crops, and you
must suffer with the company in which you are found.”
People are judged by the company they keep.
THE BOY WHO CRIED 'WOLF'
100 Moral Stories 5 www.islamicoccasions.com
A tortoise one day met a hare who made fun of her.
“My, my, you move so slowly, you will never get far!”
The tortoises, upset by the hare's manner, said,
“Let's have a race and see who is faster.”
The hare laughed and said, “You must be joking! But all right, we'll
see who reaches the other side of the hill first.” Off he ran, leaving
the tortoise far behind.
After a while, the hare stopped to wait for the tortoise to come long.
He waited and waited till he felt sleepy. “I might as well take a nap,”
he thought. “Even if she catches up with me, I can easily win the
race.” So he lay down under a shady tree and closed his eyes.
When the tortoise passed the sleeping hare, she walked on slowly
but steadily. By the time the hare woke up, the tortoise was near
the finishing line. He ran as fast as he could, but he could not catch
up with the tortoise.
Slow and steady can win the race.
THE ANT AND THE DOVE
One hot day, an ant was searching for some water.
After walking around for some time, she came to a spring.
To reach the spring, she had to climb up a blade of grass.
While making her way up, she slipped and fell into the water.
She could have drowned if a dove up a nearby tree had not
seen her. Seeing that the ant was in trouble, the dove quickly
plucked off a leaf and dropped it into the water near the
struggling ant. The ant moved towards the leaf and
climbed up there. Soon it carried her safely to dry ground.
Just at that time, a hunter nearby was throwing out his net
towards the dove, hoping to trap it.
Guessing what he was about to do, the ant quickly bit him on
the heel. Feeling the pain, the hunter dropped his net. The
dove was quick to fly away to safety.
One good turn deserves another.
THE HARE AND THE TORTOISE
100 Moral Stories 6 www.islamicoccasions.com
One day long ago, some sailors set out to sea in their sailing ship. One of
them brought his pet monkey along for the long journey.
When they were far out at sea, a terrible storm overturned their ship.
Everyone fell into the sea, and the monkey was sure that he would drown.
Suddenly a dolphin appeared and picked him up.
They soon reached the island and the monkey came down from the
dolphin's back. The dolphin asked the monkey, “Do you know this place?”
The monkey replied, “Yes, I do. In fact, the king of the island is my best
friend. Do you know that I am actually a prince?”
Knowing that no one lived on the island, the dolphin said, “Well, well, so
you are a prince! Now you can be a king!”
The monkey asked, “How can I be a king?”
As the dolphin started swimming away, he answered, “That is easy. As you are the only creature on
this island, you will naturally be the king!”
Those who lie and boast may end up in trouble.
THE FOX AND THE STORK
A selfish fox once invited a stork to dinner at his home in a hollow tree. That evening, the stork flew
to the fox's home and knocked on the door with her long beak. The fox opened the door and said,
“Please come in and share my food.”
The stork was invited to sit down at the table. She was very hungry and the food smelled delicious!
The fox served soup in shallow bowls and he licked up all his soup very quickly. However, the stork
could not have any of it as the bowl was too shallow for her long beak. The poor stork just smiled
politely and stayed hungry.
The selfish fox asked, “Stork, why haven't you taken your soup? Don't you like it?”
The stork replied, “It was very kind of you to invite me for dinner.
Tomorrow evening, please join me for dinner at my home.”
The next day, when the fox arrived at the stork's home, he
saw that they were also having soup for dinner. This time
the soup was served in tall jugs. The stork drank the soup
easily but the fox could not reach inside the tall jug. This
time it was his turn to go hungry.
A selfish act can backfire on you.
THE MONKEY AND THE DOLPHIN
100 Moral Stories 7 www.islamicoccasions.com
A lamb was grazing with a flock of sheep one day. She soon found
some sweet grass at the edge of the field. Farther and farther she went,
away from the others.
She was enjoying herself so much that she did not notice a wolf
coming nearer to her. However, when it pounced on her, she was quick
to start pleading, “Please, please don't eat me yet. My stomach is full of
grass. If you wait a while, I will taste much better.”
The wolf thought that was a good idea, so he sat down and waited.
After a while, the lamb said, “If you allow me to dance, the grass in my
stomach will be digested faster.” Again the wolf agreed.
While the lamb was dancing, she had a new idea. She said,
“Please take the bell from around my neck. If you ring it as hard as you
can, I will be able to dance even faster.”
The wolf took the bell and rang it as hard as he could. The shepherd heard the bell ringing and
quickly sent his dogs to find the missing lamb. The barking dogs frightened the wolf away and
saved the lamb's life.
The gentle and weak can sometimes be cleverer than fierce and strong.
THE FOX AND THE GRAPES
It was a sunny day and fox was walking across the fields. Soon he came to a vineyard.
As he came nearer, he could see some bunches of juicy grapes.
The fox looked carefully around him. He had to make sure that he was safe from the hunters.
He decided to steal some before anyone came along.
He jumped upwards but he could not reach the grapes. He jumped
again as high as he could. He still could not reach them. The grapes
were just too high for him!
He was not ready to give up. He backed off, took some running steps
and leapt into the air towards the grapes. Again he failed to reach
them.
It was getting dark, and he was getting angry. His legs hurt with all
that running and jumping. At last he stopped trying.
As he walked away, he said to himself, “I don't really want those
grapes. I'm sure they are too sour to eat.”
Sometimes when we cannot get what we want,
we pretend that it is not worth having.
THE WOLF AND THE LAMB
100 Moral Stories 8 www.islamicoccasions.com
One hot day, a thirsty crow flew all over the fields looking for
water. For a long time, she could not find any. She felt very weak,
almost giving up hope.
Suddenly, she saw a water jug below her. She flew straight down
to see if there was any water inside. Yes, she could see some water
inside the jug!
The crow tried to push her head into the jug. Sadly, she found
that the neck of the jug was too narrow. Then she tried to push
the jug down for the water to flow out. She found that the jug
was too heavy.
The crow thought hard for a while. Then looking around her, she
saw some pebbles. She suddenly had a good idea. She started
picking up the pebbles one by one, dropping each into the jug.
As more and more pebbles filled the jug, the water level kept
rising. Soon it was high enough for the crow to drink. Her plan had
worked!
If you try hard enough, you may soon find an answer to your problem.
THE MILKMAID
A milkmaid was on her way to the market to sell some milk from her cow. As she carried the large
jug of milk on top of her head, she began to dream of all the things she could do after selling the
milk.
“With that money, I'll buy a hundred chicks to rear in my backyard. When they are fully grown.
I can sell them at a good price at the market.”
As she walked on, she continued dreaming, “Then I'll buy
two young goats and rear them on the grass close by. When
they are fully grown, I can sell them at an even better price!”
Still dreaming, she said to herself, “Soon, I'll be able to buy
another cow, and I will have more milk to sell. Then I shall
have even more money...”
With these happy thoughts, she began to skip and jump.
Suddenly she tripped and fell. The jug broke and all the
milk spilt onto the ground.
No more dreaming now, she sat down and cried.
Do not count your chickens before they are hatched.
THE THIRSTY CROW
100 Moral Stories 9 www.islamicoccasions.com
The Pencil Maker took the pencil aside, just before putting him into the box.
“There are 5 things you need to know,” he told the pencil, “Before I send you out into the world.
Always remember them and never forget, and you will become the best pencil you can be.”
One: “You will be able to do many great things, but only if you allow yourself to be held in
someone's hand.”
Two: “You will experience a painful
sharpening from time to time, but
you'll need it to become a better
pencil.”
Three: “You will be able to correct
any mistakes you might make.”
Four: “The most important part of
you will always be what's inside.”
And Five: “On every surface you are used on, you must leave your mark. No matter what the
condition, you must continue to write.”
The pencil understood and promised to remember, and went into the box with purpose in its heart.
Now replacing the place of the pencil with you. Always remember them and never forget, and you
will become the best person you can be.
One: “You will be able to do many great things, but only if you allow yourself to be held in God's
hand. And allow other human beings to access you for the many gifts you possess.”
Two: “You will experience a painful sharpening from time to time, by going through various
problems in life, but you'll need it to become a stronger person.”
Three: “You will be able to correct any mistakes you might make.”
Four: “The most important part of you will always be what's on the inside.”
And Five: “On every surface you walk through, you must leave your mark. No matter what the
situation, you must continue to do your duties.”
Allow this parable on the pencil to encourage you to know that you are a special person and only
you can fulfill the purpose to which you were born to accomplish.
Never allow yourself to get discouraged and think that
your life is insignificant and cannot make a change.
PARABLE OF THE PENCIL
100 Moral Stories 10 www.islamicoccasions.com
A long time ago, there was a huge apple tree. A little boy loved to come and play around it
everyday. He climbed to the treetop, ate the apples, and took a nap under the shadow. He loved the
tree and the tree loved to play with him. Time went by, the little boy had grown up and he no
longer played around the tree every day.
One day, the boy came back to the tree and he looked sad.
“Come and play with me”, the tree asked the boy.
“I am no longer a kid, I do not play around trees any more”
the boy replied.
“I want toys. I need money to buy them.”
“Sorry, but I do not have money, but you can pick all my apples
and sell them. So, you will have money.”
The boy was so excited. He grabbed all the apples on the tree and
left happily. The boy never came back after he picked the apples.
The tree was sad.
One day, the boy who now turned into a man returned and
the tree was excited.
“Come and play with me” the tree said.
“I do not have time to play. I have to work for my family. We need a house for shelter.
Can you help me?”
“Sorry, but I do not have any house. But you can chop off my branches to build your house.” So the
man cut all the branches of the tree and left happily. The tree was glad to see him happy but the
man never came back since then. The tree was again lonely and sad.
One hot summer day, the man returned and the tree was delighted.
“Come and play with me!” the tree said.
“I am getting old. I want to go sailing to relax myself. Can you give me a boat?” said the man.
“Use my trunk to build your boat. You can sail far away and be happy.”
So the man cut the tree trunk to make a boat. He went sailing and never showed up for a long time.
Finally, the man returned after many years. “Sorry, my boy. But I do not have anything for you
anymore. No more apples for you”, the tree said. “No problem, I do not have any teeth to bite” the
man replied.
THE BOY AND THE APPLE TREE
100 Moral Stories 11 www.islamicoccasions.com
“No more trunk for you to climb on.” “I am too old for that now” the man said.
“I really cannot give you anything, the only thing left is my dying roots,” the tree said with tears.
“I do not need much now, just a place to rest. I am tired after all these years,” the man replied.
“Good! Old tree roots are the best place to lean on and rest, come sit down with me and rest.”
The man sat down and the tree was glad and smiled with tears.
This is a story of everyone. The tree is like our parents. When we were young, we loved to play with
our Mum and Dad. When we grow up, we leave them; only come to them when we need something
or when we are in trouble. No matter what, parents will always be there and give everything they
could just to make you happy.
You may think the boy is cruel to the tree, but that is how all of us treat our parents. We take them
for granted; we don't appreciate all they do for us, until it's too late. Wallahi, May Allah forgives us
of our shortcomings and may He guide us.
THE ANGEL
Once upon a time there was a child ready to be born. One day the child asked God, “They tell me
you are going to send me to earth tomorrow but how am I going to live there being so small and
helpless?” God replied, “Among the many angels I have chosen one for you. She will be waiting for
you and will take care of you.”
Said child, “But tell me here in Heaven I don't do anything else but sing and smile. That's what I
need to be happy!” God replied, “Your angel will sing for you every day. And you will feel your
angel's love and be happy.”
And, said the child, “How am I going to be able to understand when people talk to me, if I don't
know the language that men talk?” “That's easy”, God said, “Your angel will tell you the most
beautiful and sweet words you will ever hear, and with much patience and care, your angel will
teach you how to speak.” The child looked up at God saying, “And what am I going to do when I
want to talk to you?” God smiled at the child saying, “Your angel will teach you how to pray.”
The child said, “I've heard on earth there are bad men. Who will protect me?” God replied, “Your
angel will defend you, even if it means risking life!” The child looked sad, saying, “But I will always
be sad because I will not see you anymore.” God replied, “Your angel will always talk to you about
me and will teach you the way to come back to
me, even though I will always be next to you.”
At that moment there was much peace in Heaven,
but voices from earth could already be heard.
The child in a hurry, asked softly, “Oh God, if
I am about to leave now please tell me my angel's
name!” God replied, Your angel's name is of no
importance… you will simply call her
MOTHER!
100 Moral Stories 12 www.islamicoccasions.com
A mother duck and her little ducklings were on their way
to the lake one day. The ducklings were very happy
following their mother and quack-quacking along the way.
All of a sudden the mother duck saw a fox in the distance.
She was frightened and shouted, “Children, hurry to the
lake. There's a fox!”
The ducklings hurried towards the lake. The mother duck
wondered what to do. She began to walk back and forth dragging one wing on the ground.
When the fox saw her he became happy. He said to himself, “It seems that
she's hurt and can't fly! I can easily catch and eat her!” Then he ran
towards her.
The mother duck ran, leading the fox away from the lake. The fox followed
her. Now he wouldn't be able to harm her ducklings. The mother duck
looked towards her ducklings and saw that they had reached the lake. She was relieved, so she
stopped and took a deep breath.
The fox thought she was tired and he came closer, but the mother duck quickly spread her wings
and rose up in the air. She landed in the middle of the lake and her ducklings swam to her.
The fox stared in disbelief at the mother duck and her ducklings. He could not reach them because
they were in the middle of the lake.
Dear children, some birds drag one of their wings on the ground when an enemy is
going to attack. In this way they fool their enemies into thinking they are hurt. When
the enemy follows them this gives their children time to escape.
MENTALLY RETARDED!
A few years ago, at the Seattle Special Olympics, nine contestants, all physically or
mentally disabled, assembled at the starting line for the 100-yard dash.
At the gun, they all started out, not exactly in a dash, but with a relish to run the
race to the finish and win. All, that is, except one little boy who stumbled on the
asphalt, tumbled over a couple of times, and began to cry. The other eight heard the boy cry. They
slowed down and looked back. Then they all turned around and went back.....every one of them.
One girl with Down's syndrome bent down and kissed him and said, “This will make it better.”
Then all nine linked arms and walked together to the finish line. Everyone in the stadium stood,
and the cheering went on for several minutes. People who were there are still telling the story.
Why? Because deep down we know this one thing: What matters in this life is more
than winning for ourselves. What matters in this life is helping others win, even if it
means slowing down and changing our course.
THE DEVOTED MOTHER
100 Moral Stories 13 www.islamicoccasions.com
A little boy came up to his mother in the kitchen one evening while she was fixing supper, and he
handed her a piece of paper that he had been writing on. After his mom dried her hands on an
apron, she read it, and this is what it said:
For cutting the grass: $5.00
For cleaning up my room this week: $1.00
For going to the store for you: $.50
Baby-sitting my kid brother while you went shopping: $.25
Taking out the garbage: $1.00
For getting a good report card: $5.00
For cleaning up and raking the yard: $2.00
Total owed: $14.75
Well, his mother looked at him standing there, and the boy could see the memories flashing
through her mind. She picked up the pen, turned over the paper he had written on, and this is what
she wrote:
For the nine months I carried you while you were growing
inside me: No Charge.
For all the nights that I've sat up with you, doctored and
prayed for you: No Charge.
For all the trying times, and all the tears that you've caused
through the years: No Charge.
For all the nights filled with dread, and for the worries I
knew were ahead: No Charge.
For the toys, food, clothes, and even wiping your nose:
No Charge.
When you add it up, the cost of my love is: No Charge.
When the boy finished reading what his mother had
written, there were big tears in his eyes, and he looked
straight up at his mother and said, “Mom, I sure do love you.”
And then he took the pen and in great big letters he wrote:
“PAID IN FULL.”
PAID IN FULL

A young man was getting ready to graduate college. For many months he had admired a beautiful
sports car in a dealer's showroom, and knowing his father could well afford it, he told him that was
all he wanted. As Graduation Day approached, the young man awaited signs that his father had
purchased the car. On the morning of his graduation his father called him into his private study.
His father told him how proud he was to have such a fine son, and told
him how much he loved him. He handed his son a beautiful wrapped
gift box. Curious, but somewhat disappointed the young man opened
the box and found a lovely, leather-bound Holy Qur'an. Angrily, he
raised his voice at his father and said, “With all your money you give
me a Holy book?” and stormed out of the house, leaving the holy book.
He never contacted his father again for long long time. Many years
passed and the young man was very successful in business. He had a
beautiful home and wonderful family, but realized his father was very old, and thought perhaps he
should go to him. He had not seen him since that graduation day.
Before he could make arrangements, he received a telegram telling him his father had passed away,
and willed all of his possessions to his son. He needed to come home immediately and take care
things. When he arrived at his father's house, sudden sadness and regret filled his heart. He began
to search his father's important papers and saw the still new Holy Qur'an, just as he had left it years
ago. With tears, he opened the Holy Qur'an and began to turn the pages. As he Read those words, a
car key dropped from an envelope taped behind the Holy Qur'an. It had a tag with the dealer's
name, the same dealer who had the sports car he had desired. On the tag was the date of his
graduation, and the words PAID IN FULL.
How many times do we miss GOD blessings because
they are not packaged as we expected?
WHAT IS A FAMILY?
A man came home from work late, tired and irritated,
to find his 5-year old son waiting for him at the door.
SON: “Daddy, may I ask you a question?”
DAD: “Yeah sure, what is it?” replied the man.
SON: “Daddy, how much do you make an hour?”
DAD: “That's none of your business. Why do you ask such a thing?” the man said angrily.
SON: “I just want to know. Please tell me, how much do you make an hour?”
DAD: “If you must know, I make $20 an hour.”
“Oh,” the little boy replied, with his head down. Looking up, he said,
“Daddy, may I please borrow $10?”
BEAUTIFUL GIFT!
100 Moral Stories 15 www.islamicoccasions.com
The father was furious, “If the only reason you asked that is so you can borrow some money to buy
a silly toy or some other nonsense, then you march yourself straight to your room and go to bed.
Think about why you are being so selfish. I work hard everyday for such this childish behavior.”
The little boy quietly went to his room and shut the door. The man sat down and started to get even
angrier about the little boy's questions. How dare he ask such questions only to get some money?
After about an hour or so, the man had calmed down, and started to think: Maybe there was
something he really needed to buy with that $10 and he really didn't ask for money very often.
The man went to the door of the little boy's room and opened the door.
“Are you asleep, son?” He asked. “No daddy, I'm awake,” replied the boy.
“I've been thinking, maybe I was too hard on you earlier,” said the man. “It's been a long day and
I took out my aggravation on you. Here's the $10 you asked for.”
The little boy sat straight up, smiling. “Oh, thank you daddy!” He yelled.
Then, reaching under his pillow he pulled out some crumpled up bills.
The man, seeing that the boy already had money, started to get angry again.
The little boy slowly counted out his money, and then looked up at his father.
“Why do you want more money if you already have some?” the father grumbled.
“Because I didn't have enough, but now I do,” the little boy replied.
“Daddy, I have $20 now. Can I buy an hour of your time? Please come home early tomorrow.
I would like to have dinner with you.”
Share this story with someone you like.... But even better, share $20 worth of time with someone
you love. It's just a short reminder to all of you working so hard in life.
We should not let time slip through our fingers without having spent some time with those who
really matter to us, those close to our hearts.
If we die tomorrow, the company that we are working for could easily replace us in a matter of
days.
But the family & friends we leave behind will feel the loss for the rest of their lives. And come to
think of it, we pour ourselves more into work than to our family. An unwise investment indeed!
So what is the moral of the story???
Don't work too hard...and you know what's the full word of FAMILY?
FAMILY = (F)ATHER (A)ND (M)OTHER,(I)(L)OVE (Y)OU!

TRUE WEALTH
One day a father of a very wealthy family took his son on a trip to the country with the purpose of
showing his son how the poor people live so he could be thankful for his wealth.
They spent a couple of days and nights on the farm of what would be considered a very poor family.
On their return from their trip, the father asked his son, “How was the trip?” “It was great, Dad.”
“Did you see how poor people can be?” the father asked. “Oh yeah” said the son. “So what did you
learn from the trip?” asked the father.
The son answered, “I saw that we have one dog and they had four.
We have a pool that reaches to the middle of our garden and they
have a creek that has no end.” “We have imported lanterns in our
garden and they have the stars at night.” “Our patio reaches to the
front yard and they have the whole horizon.” “We have a small
piece of land to live on and they have fields that go beyond our
sight.” “We have servants who serve us, but they serve others.”
“We buy our food, but they grow theirs.” “We have walls around
our property to protect us; they have friends to protect them.”
With this the boy's father was speechless. Then his son added, “Thanks dad for showing me how
poor we are.”
A HOLE IN THE FENCE
There once was a little boy who had a bad temper. His Father gave him a bag of nails and told him
that every time he lost his temper, he must hammer a nail into the back of the fence.
The first day the boy had driven 37 nails into the fence. Over the next few weeks, as he learned to
control his anger, the number of nails hammered daily gradually dwindled down. He discovered it
was easier to hold his temper than to drive those nails into the fence....
Finally the day came when the boy didn't lose his temper at all. He told his father about it and the
father suggested that the boy now pull out one nail for each day that he was able to hold his
temper. The day passed and the young boy was finally able to tell his father that all the nails were
gone. The father took his son by the hand and led him to the fence. He said, “You have done well,
my son, but look at the holes in the fence.”
The fence will never be the same. When you say things in anger, they leave a scar just like this one.
You can put a knife in a man and draw it out. It won't matter how many times you say I'm sorry,
the wound is still there. A verbal wound is as bad as a physical one.
Friends and loved ones are a very rare jewel, indeed.
They make you smile and encourage you to succeed.
They lend an ear, they share a word of praise, and they
always want to open their hearts to us. Water your
relationships with kindness… and they will grow. So be
careful little lips what you say…! And you won't chase
friendships away.

A frail old man went to live with his son, daughter-in-law, and four-year old grandson. The old
man's hands trembled, his eyesight was blurred, and his step faltered. The family ate together at
the table. But the elderly grandfather's shaky hands and failing sight made eating difficult. Peas
rolled off his spoon onto the floor. When he grasped, the glass, milk spilled on the tablecloth.
The son and daughter-in-law became irritated with the mess. “We must do something about
Grandfather,” said the son. “I've had enough of his spilled milk, noisy eating, and food on the
floor.” So the husband and wife set a small table in the corner. There, Grandfather ate alone while
the rest of the family enjoyed dinner. Since Grandfather had broken a dish or two, his food was
served in a wooden bowl. When the family glanced in Grandfather's direction, sometimes he had a
tear in his eye as he sat alone. Still, the only words the couple had for him were sharp admonitions
when he dropped a fork or spilled food. The four-year-old watched it all in silence.
One evening before supper, the father noticed his son playing with wood scraps on the floor. He
asked the child sweetly, “What are you making?” Just as sweetly, the boy responded, “Oh, I am
making a little bowl for you and Mama to eat your food in when I grow up.” The four-year-old
smiled and went back to work. The words so struck the parents that they were speechless. Then
tears started to stream down their cheeks. Though no word was spoken, both knew what must be
done.
That evening the husband took Grandfather's hand and gently led him back to the family table.
For the remainder of his days he ate every meal with the family.
And for some reason, neither husband nor wife seemed to care
any longer when a fork was dropped, milk spilled, or the
tablecloth soiled.
Children are remarkably perceptive. Their eyes ever observe, their ears ever listen, and their minds
ever process the messages they absorb. If they see us patiently provide a happy home atmosphere
for family members, they will imitate that attitude for the rest of their lives. The wise parent
realizes that every day the building blocks are being laid for the child's future. Let's be wise builders
and role models.
“Life is about people connecting with people, and making a positive difference.
Take care of yourself, ... and those you love, ... today, ... and everyday!”
FATHERS EYES
A teenager lived alone with his father, and the two of them had a very special relationship. The
father believed in encouragement. Even though the son was always on the bench, his father was
always in the stands cheering. He never missed a game.
This young man was the smallest of the class when he entered high school. His father continued to
encourage him but also made it very clear that he did not have to play football if he didn't want to.
But the young man loved football and decided to hang in there. He was determined to try his best
at every practice, and perhaps he'd get to play when he became a senior. All through high school he
never missed a practice or a game, but remained a bench warmer all four years. His faithful father
was always in the stands, always with words of encouragement for him. When the young man went

to college, he decided to try out for the football team as a “walk-on.”
Everyone was sure he could never make the cut, but he did. The coach admitted that he kept him
on the roster because he always puts his heart and soul to every practice, and at the same time,
provided the other members with the spirit and hustle they badly needed. The news that he had
survived the cut thrilled him so much that he rushed to the nearest phone and called his father.
His father shared his excitement and was sent season tickets for all the college games. This
persistent young athlete never missed practice during his four years at college, but he never got to
play in the game.
It was the end of his senior football season, and as he trotted onto the practice field shortly before
the big play off game, the coach met him with a telegram. The young man read the telegram and he
became deathly silent. Swallowing hard, he mumbled to the coach, “My father died this morning.
Is it all right if I miss practice today?”
The coach put his arm gently around his shoulder and said, “Take the rest of the week off, son.
And don't even plan to come back to the game on Saturday.” Saturday arrived, and the game was
not going well.
In the third quarter, when the team was ten points behind, a silent young man quietly slipped into
the empty locker room and put on his football gear. As he ran onto the sidelines, the coach and his
players were astounded to see their faithful team-mate back so soon.
“Coach, please let me play. I've just got to play today,” said the young man.
The coach pretended not to hear him. There was no way he wanted his worst player in this close
playoff game. But the young man persisted, and finally feeling sorry for the kid, the coach gave in.
“All right,” he said. “You can go in.” Before long, the coach, the players and everyone in the stands
could not believe their eyes. This little unknown, who had never played before, was doing
everything right. The opposing team could not stop him. He ran, he passed, blocked and tackled
like a star. His team began to triumph.
The score was soon tied. In the closing seconds of the game, this kid intercepted a pass and ran all
the way for the winning touchdown. The fans broke loose. His team-mates hoisted him onto their
shoulders. Such cheering you've never heard!
Finally, after the stands had emptied and the team had
showered and left the locker room, the coach noticed
that the young man was sitting quietly in the corner all
alone. The coach came to him and said, “Kid, I can't
believe it. You were fantastic!”
Tell me what got into you? How did you do it? He
looked at the coach, with tears in his eyes, and said,
“Well, you knew my dad died, but did you know that my
dad was blind?” The young man swallowed hard and
forced a smile, “Dad came to all my games, but today
was the first time he could see me play, and I wanted to
show him I could do it!”

A man found a cocoon of a butterfly. One day a small opening appeared; he sat and watched the
butterfly for several hours as it struggled to force its body through that little hole. Then it seemed
to stop making any progress. It appeared as if it had gotten as far as it could and it could go no
farther.
Then the man decided to help the butterfly, so he took a pair of scissors
and snipped off the remaining bit of the cocoon. The butterfly then
emerged easily. But it had a swollen body and small, shriveled wings.
The man continued to watch the butterfly because he expected that, at any
moment, the wings would enlarge and expand to be able to support the
body, which would contract in time.
Neither happened! In fact, the butterfly spent the rest of its life crawling
around with a swollen body and shriveled wings. It never was able to fly.
What this man in his kindness and haste did not understand was that the
restricting cocoon and the struggle required for the butterfly to get
through the tiny opening were nature's way of forcing fluid from the body
of the butterfly into its wings so that it would be ready for flight once it
achieved its freedom from the cocoon.
Sometimes struggles are exactly what we need in our life. If nature allowed us to go
through our life without any obstacles, it would cripple us. We would not be as strong
as what we could have been. And we could never fly...
THE OBSTACLE IN OUR PATH
In ancient times, a king had a boulder placed on a roadway. Then he hid himself and watched to
see if anyone would remove the huge rock. Some of the king's wealthiest merchants and courtiers
came by and simply walked around it.
Many loudly blamed the king for not keeping the roads clear, but none did anything about getting
the big stone out of the way. Then a peasant came along carrying a load of vegetables. On
approaching the boulder, the peasant laid down his burden and tried to move the stone to the side
of the road. After much pushing and straining, he finally succeeded. As the peasant picked up his
load of vegetables, he noticed a purse lying in the road where the boulder had been.
The purse contained many gold coins and a note from the
king indicating that the gold was for the person who
removed the boulder from the roadway. The peasant
learned what many others never understand.
Every obstacle presents an opportunity to
improve one's condition.

DON'T JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER!
A lady in a faded gingham dress and her husband, dressed in a homespun threadbare suit, stepped
off the train in Boston and walk timidly without an appointment into the Harvard University
President's outer office.
The secretary could tell in a moment that such backwoods, country hicks had no business at
Harvard and probably didn't even deserve to be in Cambridge.
“We want to see the president,” the man said softly.
“He'll be busy all day,” the secretary snapped.
“We'll wait,” the lady replied.
For hours the secretary ignored them, hoping that the couple would finally become discouraged
and go away. They didn't and the secretary grew frustrated and finally decided to disturb the
president, even though it was a chore she always regretted.
“Maybe if you see them for a few minutes, they'll leave,” she said to him.
He sighed in exasperation and nodded. Someone of his importance obviously didn't have the time
to spend with them, but he detested gingham dresses and homespun suits cluttering up his outer
office.
The president, stern faced and with dignity, strutted toward the couple.
The lady told him, “We had a son who attended Harvard for one year. He loved Harvard. He was
happy here. But about a year ago, he was accidentally killed. My husband and I would like to erect a
memorial to him, somewhere on campus.”
The president wasn't touched.... He was shocked.
“Madam,” he said, gruffly, “we can't put up a statue for every person who attended Harvard and
died. If we did, this place would look like a cemetery.”
“Oh, no,” the lady explained quickly. “We don't want to erect a statue. We thought we would like to
give a building to Harvard.”

exclaimed, “A building! Do you have any earthly idea how much a building costs? We have over
seven and a half million dollars in the physical buildings here at Harvard.”
For a moment the lady was silent.
The president was pleased. Maybe he could get rid of them now.
The lady turned to her husband and said quietly, “Is that all it
costs to start a university? Why don't we just start our own?”
Her husband nodded.
The president's face wilted in confusion and bewilderment. Mr.
and Mrs. Leland Stanford got up and walked away, traveling to
Palo Alto, California where they established the University that
bears their name, Stanford University, a memorial to a son that
Harvard no longer cared about.

MOUNTAIN STORY
A son and his father were walking on the mountains.
Suddenly, his son falls, hurts himself and screams: “AAAhhhhhhhhhhh!”
To his surprise, he hears the voice repeating, somewhere in the mountain: “AAAhhhhhhhhhhh!”
Curious, he yells: “Who are you?”
He receives the answer: “Who are you?”
And then he screams to the mountain: “I admire you!”
The voice answers: “I admire you!”
Angered at the response, he screams: “Coward!”
He receives the answer: “Coward!”
He looks to his father and asks: “What's going on?”
The father smiles and says: “My son, pay attention.”
Again the man screams: “You are a champion!”
The voice answers: “You are a champion!”
The boy is surprised, but does not understand.
Then the father explains: “People call this ECHO,
but really this is LIFE.”
It gives you back everything you say or do.
Our life is simply a reflection of our actions.
If you want more love in the world,
create more love in your heart.
If you want more competence in your team,
improve your competence.
This relationship applies to everything, in all aspects of life;
Life will give you back everything you have given to it.”

A group of frogs were hopping contentedly through the woods, going about their froggy business,
when two of them fell into a deep pit. All of the other frogs gathered around the pit to see what
could be done to help their companions. When they saw how deep the pit was, the rest of the
dismayed group agreed that it was hopeless and told the two frogs in the pit that they should
prepare themselves for their fate, because they were as good as dead.
Unwilling to accept this terrible fate, the two frogs began to jump with all of their might. Some of
the frogs shouted into the pit that it was hopeless, and that the two frogs wouldn't be in that
situation if they had been more careful, more obedient to the froggy rules, and more responsible.
The other frogs continued sorrowfully shouting that they should save their energy and give up,
since they were already as good as dead. The two frogs continued jumping as hard as they could,
and after several hours of desperate effort were quite weary.
Finally, one of the frogs took heed to the calls of his fellows. Spent and disheartened, he quietly
resolved himself to his fate, lay down at the bottom of the pit, and died as the others looked on in
helpless grief. The other frog continued to jump with every ounce of energy he had, although his
body was wracked with pain and he was completely exhausted.
His companions began a new, yelling for him to accept his fate, stop the pain and just die.
The weary frog jumped harder and harder and - wonder of wonders! Finally leapt so high that he
sprang from the pit. Amazed, the other frogs celebrated his
miraculous freedom and then gathering around him asked,
“Why did you continue jumping when we told you it was
impossible?” Reading their lips, the astonished frog
explained to them that he was deaf, and that when he saw
their gestures and shouting, he thought they were cheering
him on. What he had perceived as encouragement inspired
him to try harder and to succeed against all odds.
This simple story contains a powerful lesson. Your encouraging words can lift someone up and help
him or her make it through the day. Your destructive words can cause deep wounds; they may be
the weapons that destroy someone's desire to continue trying - or even their life. Your destructive,
careless word can diminish someone in the eyes of others, destroy their influence and have a lasting
impact on the way others respond to them.
WEAKNESS OR STRENGTH?
Sometimes your biggest weakness can become your biggest strength. Take, for example, the story of
one 10-year-old boy who decided to study Judo despite the fact that he
had lost his left arm in a devastating car accident.
The boy began lessons with an old Japanese Judo Master Sensei.
The boy was doing well, so he couldn't understand why, after three
months of training the master had taught him only one move.
“Sensei,” the boy finally said, “Shouldn't I be learning more moves?”
A LESSON FROM A FROG TALE
100 Moral Stories 23 www.islamicoccasions.com
“This is the only move you know, but this is the only move you'll ever need to know,”
the Sensei replied.
Not quite understanding, but believing in his teacher, the boy kept training.
Several months later, the Sensei took the boy to his first tournament. Surprising himself, the boy
easily won his first two matches. The third match proved to be more difficult, but after some time,
his opponent became impatient and charged; the boy deftly used his one move to win the match.
Still amazed by his success, the boy was now in the finals.
This time, his opponent was bigger, stronger, and more experienced. For a while, the boy appeared
to be overmatched. Concerned that the boy might get hurt, the referee called a time-out.
He was about to stop the match when the sensei intervened.
“No,” the Sensei insisted, “Let him continue.”
Soon after the match resumed, his opponent made a critical mistake: he dropped his guard.
Instantly, the boy used his move to pin him. The boy had won the match and the tournament.
He was the champion.
On the way home, the boy and Sensei reviewed every move in each and every match.
Then the boy summoned the courage to ask what was really on his mind.
“Sensei, how did I win the tournament with only one move?”
“You won for two reasons,” the Sensei answered. “First, you've almost mastered one of the most
difficult throws in all of Judo. And second, the only known defense for that move is for your
opponent to grab your left arm.”
The boy's biggest weakness had become his biggest strength.
JUST P.U.S.H!
A man was sleeping at night in his cabin when suddenly his room filled with light, and the Lord
told the man he had work for him to do, and showed him a large rock in front of his cabin.
The Lord explained that the man was to push against the rock with all his might. So, this the man
did, day after day. For many years he toiled from sun up to
sun down; his shoulders set squarely against the cold,
massive surface of the unmoving rock, pushing with all of
his might. Each night the man returned to his cabin sore and
worn out, feeling that his whole day had been spent in vain.
Since the man was showing discouragement, the Adversary
(Satan) decided to enter the picture by placing thoughts into
the weary mind: “you have been pushing against that rock for
a long time, and it hasn't moved.” Thus, giving the man the
impression that the task was impossible and that he was a
failure. These thoughts discouraged and disheartened the
man. Satan said, “Why kill yourself over this?”

“Just put in your time, giving just the minimum effort; and that will be good enough.”
That's what he planned to do, but decided to make it a matter of prayer and take his troubled
thoughts to the Lord. “Lord,” he said, “I have labored long and hard in your service, putting all my
strength to do that which you have asked. Yet, after all this time, I have not even budged that rock
by half a millimeter. What is wrong? Why am I failing?”
The Lord responded compassionately, “My Servant, when I asked you to serve Me and you
accepted, I told you that your task was to push against the rock with all of your strength, which you
have done. Never once did I mention to you that I expected you to move it. Your task was to push.
And now you come to Me with your strength spent, thinking that you have failed. But, is that really
so? Look at yourself. Your arms are strong and muscled, your back sinewy and brown, your hands
are callused from constant pressure, your legs have become massive and hard.
Through opposition you have grown much, and your abilities now surpass that which you used to
have. Yet you haven't moved the rock. But your calling was to be obedient and to push and to
exercise your faith and trust in My wisdom. This you have done. Now I, my servant, will move the
rock.” At times, when we hear a word from God, we tend to use our own intellect to decipher what
He wants, when actually what God wants is just a simple obedience and faith in Him. By all means,
exercise the faith that moves mountains, but know that it is still God who moves mountains.

In 1883, a creative engineer named John Roebling was inspired by an idea to build a spectacular
bridge connecting New York with the Long Island. However bridge building experts throughout the
world thought that this was an impossible feat and told Roebling to forget the idea. It just could not
be done. It was not practical. It had never been done before.
Roebling could not ignore the vision he had in his mind of this bridge. He thought about it all the
time and he knew deep in his heart that it could be done. He just had to share the dream with
someone else. After much discussion and persuasion he managed to convince his son Washington,
an up and coming engineer, that the bridge in fact could be built.
Working together for the first time, the father and son developed concepts of how it could be
accomplished and how the obstacles could be overcome. With great excitement and inspiration,
and the headiness of a wild challenge before them, they hired their crew and began to build their
dream bridge.

The project started well, but when it was only a few months underway a tragic accident on the site
took the life of John Roebling. Washington was injured and left with a certain amount of brain
damage, which resulted in him not being able to walk or talk or even move.
“We told them so.”
“Crazy men and their crazy dreams.”
“It's foolish to chase wild visions.”
Everyone had a negative comment to make and felt that the project should be scrapped since the
Roeblings were the only ones who knew how the bridge could be built. In spite of his handicap
Washington was never discouraged and still had a burning desire to complete the bridge and his
mind was still as sharp as ever.
He tried to inspire and pass on his enthusiasm to some of his friends, but they were too daunted
by the task. As he lay on his bed in his hospital room, with the sunlight streaming through the
windows, a gentle breeze blew the flimsy white curtains apart and he was able to see the sky and
the tops of the trees outside for just a moment.
It seemed that there was a message for him not to give up. Suddenly an idea hit him. All he could
do was move one finger and he decided to make the best use of it. By moving this, he slowly
developed a code of communication with his wife.
He touched his wife's arm with that finger, indicating to her that he wanted her to call the
engineers again. Then he used the same method of tapping her arm to tell the engineers what to do.
It seemed foolish but the project was under way again.
For 13 years Washington tapped out his instructions with his finger on his wife's arm, until the
bridge was finally completed. Today the spectacular Brooklyn Bridge stands in all its glory as a
tribute to the triumph of one man's indomitable spirit and his determination not to be defeated by
circumstances. It is also a tribute to the engineers and their team work, and to their faith in a man
who was considered mad by half the world. It stands too as a tangible monument to the love and
devotion of his wife who for 13 long years patiently decoded the messages of her husband and told
the engineers what to do.
Perhaps this is one of the best examples of a never-say-die attitude that overcomes a terrible
physical handicap and achieves an impossible goal.
Often when we face obstacles in our day-to-day life, our hurdles seem very small in comparison to
what many others have to face.
The Brooklyn Bridge shows us that
dreams that seem impossible can be
realized with determination and
persistence, no matter what the
odds are.
Even the most distant dream
can be realized with
determination and persistence.

Once upon a time there was a water-bearer in India
who had two large pots, each hung on each end of a
pole which he carried across his neck. One of the pots
had a crack in it, and while the other pot was perfect
and always delivered a full portion of water at the end
of the long walk from the stream to the master's house,
the cracked pot arrived only half full.
For a full two years this went on daily, with the bearer
delivering only one and a half pot full of water in his
master's house.
Of course, the perfect pot was proud of its
accomplishments, perfect to the end for which it was
made. But the poor cracked pot was ashamed of its own
imperfection, and miserable that it was able to
accomplish only half of what it had been made to do.
After two years of what it perceived to be a bitter failure, it spoke to the water-bearer one day by
the stream. “I am ashamed of myself, and I want to apologize to you.” “Why?” asked the bearer.
“What are you ashamed of ?”
“I have been able, for these past two years, to deliver only half my load because this crack in my
side causes water to leak out all the way back to your master's house. Because of my flaws, you have
to do all of this work and you don't get full value from your efforts, the pot said. The water-bearer
felt sorry for the old cracked pot, and in his compassion he said, “As we return to the master's
house, I want you to notice the beautiful flowers along the path.”
Indeed, as they went up the hill, the old cracked pot took notice of the sun warming the beautiful
wild flowers on the side of the path, and this cheered it some.
But at the end of the trail, it still felt bad because it had leaked out half its load, and so again it
apologized to the bearer for its failure.
The bearer said to the pot, “Did you notice that there were flowers only on your side of your path,
but not on the other pot's side?
That's because have always known about your flaw, and I took advantage of it. I planted flower
seeds on your side of the path, and every day while we walk back from the stream, you've watered
them. For two years I have been able to pick these beautiful flowers to decorate my master's table.
Without you being just the way you are, he would not have this beauty to grace his house.”
Each of us has our own unique flaw. But it's the cracks and flaws we each have that
make our lives together so very interesting and warding. You've just got to take each
person for what they are and look for the good in them.

A man went to a barbershop to have his hair and his beard cut
as always. He started to have a good conversation with the
barber who attended him. They talked about so many things on
various subjects.
Suddenly, they touched the subject of God. The barber said:
“Look man, I don't believe that God exists as you say so.”
“Why do you say that?”
Asked the client. Well, it's so easy; you just have to go out in
the street to realize that God does not exist. Oh, tell me, if God
existed, would there be so many sick people? Would there be
abandoned children? If God existed, there would be neither
suffering nor pain. “I can't think of a God who permits all of
these things.” The client stopped for a moment thinking but he
didn't want to respond so as to prevent an argument.
The barber finished his job and the client went out of the shop.
Just after he left the barbershop, he saw a man in the street with a long hair and beard (it seems
that it had been a long time since he had his cut and he looked so untidy). Then the client again
entered the barbershop and he said to the barber: “know what? Barbers do not exist.”
“How come they don't exist?” asked the barber. “Well I am here and I am a barber.” “No!” - the
client exclaimed. “They don't exist because if they did there would be no people with long hair and
beard like that man who walks in the street.”
“Ah, barbers do exist, what happens is that people do not come to us.” “Exactly!” - Affirmed the
client. “That's the point. God does exist, what happens is people don't go to Him and do not look
for Him that's why there's so much pain and suffering in the world.”
A BOY WITH STRONG BELIEF
Shaykh Fath al-Mowsily relates, once I saw a young boy walking through the jungle. It appeared as
if he was uttering some words. I greeted him with Salaam and he replied accordingly. I inquired,
“Where are you going?” He retorted, “To the house of Allah
(Makkah).” I further asked, “What are you reciting?”
“The Qur'an” he replied. I remarked, “You are at a tender
age, it is not an obligation that you are required to fulfill.”
He said, “I have witnessed death approach people younger
than me and therefore would like to prepare if death was to
knock on my door.” I astoundingly commented, “Your steps
are small and your destination far.” He responded, “My duty
is to take the step and it remains the responsibility of Allah
to take me to my destination.” I continued to ask, “Where is
your provision and conveyance (means of transport).”
He replied, “My Yaqeen (belief) is my provision and
GOD EXISTS
100 Moral Stories 28 www.islamicoccasions.com
my feet's are my conveyance.” I explained, “I am asking you regarding bread and water.”
He replied! “Oh Shaykh if someone invited you to his house, would it be appropriate to take your
own food?” I exclaimed, “No!” “Similarly, My Lord has invited His servant to His house, it is only
the weakness of your Yaqeen that makes us carry provisions. Despite this, do you think Allah will
let me go to waste?” “Never” I replied. He then left. Sometime later I saw him in Makkah. He
approached me and inquired, “Oh Shaykh are you still of weak belief?”

A VERY POWERFUL STORY
He remembered his grandmother's warning about praying on time: “My son, you shouldn't leave
prayer to this late time.” His grandmother's age was 70 but whenever she heard the Adhan, she got
up like an arrow and performed Salah/Namaz/prayer. He, however could never win over his ego to
get up and pray. Whatever he did, his Salah was always the last to be offered and he prayed it
quickly to get it in on time. Thinking of this, he got up and realized that there were only 15 minutes
left before Salat-ul Isha. He quickly made Wudhu and performed Salat-ul Maghrib. While making
Tasbih, he again remembered his grandmother and was embarrassed by how he had prayed. His
grandmother prayed with such tranquility and peace. He began making Dua and went down to
make Sajdah and stayed like that for a while.
He had been at school all day and was tired, so tired. He awoke abruptly to the sound of noise and
shouting. He was sweating profusely. He looked around. It was very crowded. Every direction he
looked in was filled with people. Some stood frozen looking around, some were running left and
right and some were on their knees with their heads in their hands just waiting. Pure fear and
apprehension filled him as he realized where he was.
His heart was about to burst. It was the Day of Judgment. When he was alive, he had heard many
things about the questioning on the Day of Judgment, but that seemed so long ago. Could this be
something his mind made up? No, the wait and the fear were so great that he could not have imagined this. The interrogation was still going on. He began moving frantically from people to people
to ask if his name had been called. No one could answer him. All of a sudden his name was called
and the crowd split into two and made a passageway for him. Two people grabbed his arms and led
him forward. He walked with unknowing eyes through the crowd. The angels brought him to the
center and left him there. His head was bent down and his whole life was passing in front of his
eyes like a movie. He opened his eyes but saw only another world. The people were all helping others. He saw his father running from one lecture to the other, spending his wealth in the way of
Islam. His mother invited guests to their house and one table was being set while the other was
being cleared.
He pleaded his case; “I too was always on this path. I helped others. I spread the word of Allah.
I performed my Salah. I fasted in the month of Ramadan. Whatever Allah ordered us to do, I did.
Whatever he ordered us not to do, I did not.” He began to cry and think about how much he loved
Allah. He knew that whatever he had done in life would be less than what Allah deserved and his
only protector was Allah. He was sweating like never before and was shaking all over. His eyes were
fixed on the scale, waiting for the final decision. At last, the decision was made. The two angels with
sheets of paper in their hands, turned to the crowd. His legs felt like they were going to collapse. He
closed his eyes as they began to read the names of those people who were to enter Jahannam/Hell.
His name was read first. He fell on his knees and yelled that this couldn't be, “How could I go to
100 Moral Stories 29 www.islamicoccasions.com
Jahannam? I served others all my life, I spread the word of Allah to others.” His eyes had become
blurry and he was shaking with sweat. The two angels took him by the arms. As his feet dragged,
they went through the crowd and advanced toward the blazing flames of Jahannam. He was yelling
and wondered if there was any person who was going to help him. He was yelling of all the good
deeds he had done, how he had helped his father, his fasts, prayers, the Qur'an that he read, he was
asking if none of them would help him. The Jahannam angels continued to drag him. They had gotten closer to the Hellfire. He looked back and these were his last pleas. Had not Rasulullah [saw]
said, “How clean would a person be who bathes in a river five times a day, so too does the Salah
performed five times cleanse someone of their sins?” He began yelling, “My prayers? My prayers?
My prayers?”
The two angels did not stop, and they came to the edge of the abyss of Jahannam. The flames of the
fire were burning his face. He looked back one last time, but his eyes were dry of hope and he had
nothing left in him. One of the angels pushed him in.
He found himself in the air and falling towards the
flames. He had just fallen five or six feet when a hand
grabbed him by the arm and pulled him back. He lifted
his head and saw an old man with a long white beard.
He wiped some dust off himself and asked him,
“Who are you?” The old man replied, “I am your prayers.”
“Why are you so late! I was almost in the Fire! You
rescued me at the last minute before I fell in.”
The old man smiled and shook his head. “You always
performed me at the last minute, and did you forget?”
At that instant, he blinked and lifted his head from
Sajdah. He was in a sweat. He listened to the voices
coming from outside. He heard the adhan for Salat-ul
Isha. He got up quickly and went to perform Wudhu.
“Say Your Prayers Before Prayers For You Are Said.”
“Namaz Parh Is Se Pehle Ke Teri Namaz Parhi Jaye.”
WORDS AND ACTIONS SHOULD BE THE SAME
There once was a boy who loved eating sweets. He always asked for sweets from his father. His
father was a poor man. He could not always afford sweets for his son. But the little boy did not
understand this, and demanded sweets all the time.
The boy's father thought hard about how to stop the child asking for so many sweets. There was a
very holy man living nearby at that time. The boy's father had an idea. He decided to take the boy
to the great man who might be able to persuade the child to stop asking for sweets all the time.
The boy and his father went along to the great man. The father said to him, “O great saint, could
you ask my son to stop asking for sweets which I cannot afford?” The great man was in difficulty,
because he liked sweets himself. How could he ask the boy to give up asking for sweets? The holy
man told the father to bring his son back after one month.
During that month, the holy man gave up eating sweets, and when the boy and his father returned
100 Moral Stories 30 www.islamicoccasions.com
after a month, the holy man said to the boy “My dear child, will you stop asking for sweets which
your father cannot afford to give you?”
From then on, the boy stopped asking for sweets.
The boy's father asked the saint, “Why did you not ask
my son to give up asking for sweets when we came to
you a month ago?” The saint replied, “How could I ask a
boy to give up sweets when I loved sweets myself. In the
last month I gave up eating sweets.” A person's example
is much more powerful than just his words. When we ask
someone to do something, we must do it ourselves also. We should not ask others to do what we do
not do ourselves.
Always make sure that your actions and your words are same.
YOU'RE FAR MORE PRECIOUS THAN DIAMONDS AND PEARLS
“If memory serves me correctly, I was wearing a little white tank top and a
short black skirt. I had been raised Orthodox Muslim, so I had never before
worn such revealing clothing while in my father's presence. When we finally
arrived, the chauffer escorted my younger sister, Laila, and me up to my
father's suite.
As usual, he was hiding behind the door waiting to scare us. We exchanged
many hugs and kisses as we could possibly give in one day. My father took a
good look at us. Then he sat me down on his lap and said something that I
will never forget.
He looked me straight in the eyes and said, “Hana, everything that God
made valuable in the world is covered and hard to get to. Where do you find
diamonds? Deep down in the ground covered and protected. Where do you
find pearls? Deep down at the bottom of the ocean covered up and protected in a beautiful shell.
Where do you find gold? Way down in the mine, covered over with layers and layers of rock.
You've got to work hard to get to them.”
He looked at me with serious eyes. “Your body is sacred. You're far more precious than diamonds
and pearls, and you should be covered too.”

THE ONE-EYED DOE
A Doe had the misfortune to lose one of her eyes, and could not see any one
approaching her on that side. So to avoid any danger she always used to feed on
a high cliff near the sea, with her sound eye looking towards the land. By this
means she could see whenever the hunters approached her on land, and often
escaped by this means. But the hunters found out that she was blind of one eye,
and hiring a boat rowed under the cliff where she used to feed and shot her from
the sea. “Ah,” cried she with her dying voice. “You cannot escape your fate.”

Once upon a time, there was a bird in a cage who sang for her merchant owner. He
took delight in her song day and night, and was so fond of her that he served her
water in a golden dish. Before he left for a business trip, he asked the bird if she had
a wish: “I will go through the forest where you were born, past the birds of your old
neighborhood. What message should I take for them?”
The bird said, “Tell them I sit full of sorrow in a cage singing my captive song. Day
and night, my heart is full of grief. I hope it will not be long before I see my friends
again and fly freely through the trees. Bring me a message from the lovely forest,
which will set my heart at ease. Oh, I yearn for my Beloved, to fly with him, and
spread my wings. Until then there is no joy for me, and I am cut off from all of life's
sweet things.”
The merchant traveled on his donkey through the dense forest. He listened to the melodies of
many birds. When the merchant reached the forest where his bird came from, he stopped, pushed
his hood back, and said, “O you birds! Greetings to you all from my pretty bird locked in her cage.
She sends tidings of her love to you and wants to tell of her plight. She asks for a reply that will
ease her heart. My love for her keeps her captive with bars all around her. She wants to join her
Beloved and sing her songs through the air with a free heart, but I would miss her beautiful songs
and cannot let her go.”
All the birds listened to the merchant's words. Suddenly one bird shrieked and fell from a tree
brunch to the ground. The merchant froze to the spot where he stood. Nothing could astound him
more than this did. One bird had fallen down dead!
The merchant continued on to the city and traded his goods. At last he returned to his home.
He did not know what to tell his bird when she asked what message he had brought. He stood
before her cage and said, “Oh, nothing to speak of no, no.” The bird cried, “I must know at once.”
I do not know what happened, said the merchant. “I told them your message. Then, one of them
fell down dead.” Suddenly the merchant's bird let out a terrible shriek and fell on her head to the
bottom of the cage. The merchant was horrified. He wept in despair, “Oh, what have I done?”
He cried, “What Have I done? Now my life means nothing. My moon has gone and so has my sun.
Now my own bird is dead.”
He opened the cage door, reached in, and took her into his hands gently and carefully. “I will have
to bury her now,” he said; “poor thing is dead.”
Suddenly, the moment he had lifted the bird out of the cage, she swooped up, flew out of the
window and landed on the nearest roof slope. She turned to him and said, gratefully, “Thank you,
merchant master, for delivering my message. That bird's reply instructed me how to win my
freedom. All I had to do was to be dead. I gained my freedom when I chose to die.”
“So now I fly to my Beloved who waits for me. Good-bye, good-bye, my master no longer.” “My bird
was wise; she taught me secret,” the merchant reflected.
If you want to be with the ones you love, you must be ready to give up everything,
even life itself. And then, by Allah, you will win your heart's desire.

One day some wise men, who were going about the country trying to find answers to some of the
great questions of their time, came to Nasreddin's district and asked to see the wisest man in the
place. Nasreddin was brought forward, and a big crowd gathered to listen.
The first wise man began by asking,
“Where is the exact center of the world?”
“It is under my right heel,” answered Nasreddin.
“How can you prove that?” asked the first wise man.
“If you don't believe me,” answered Nasreddin,
“measure and see.”
The first wise man had nothing to answer to that,
so the second wise man asked his question.
“How many stars are there in the sky?” he said.
“As many as there are hairs on my donkey,”
answered Nasreddin.
“What proof have you got of that?”
asked the second wise man.
“If you don't believe me,” answered Nasreddin, “count the hairs on my donkey and you will see.”
“That's foolish talk,” said the other. “How can one count the hairs on a donkey?”
“Well,” answered Nasreddin, “How can one count the stars in the sky? If one is foolish talk,
so is the other.” The second wise man was silent.
The third wise man was becoming annoyed with Nasreddin and his answers, so he said, “You seem
to know a lot about your donkey, so can you tell me how many hairs there are in its tail?”
“Yes,” answered Nasreddin. “There are exactly as many hairs in its tail as there are in your beard.”
“How can you prove that?” said the other.
“I can prove it very easily,” answered Nasreddin. “You can pull one hair out of my donkey's tail for
every one I pull out of your beard. If the hairs on my donkey's tail do not come to an end at exactly
the same time as the hairs in your beard, I will admit that I was wrong.”
Of course, the third wise man was not willing to do this, so the crowd declared Nasreddin
the winner of the day's arguments.
OLD GRAVE
One day, the Nasreddin said to his friends: “If I die, bury me in an old grave.” “Why”, asked his
friends. “Because”, he explained, “if the angels come, I'll tell them that I died years before and have
already been questioned and then they will return the way they came.”

A man with his donkey carrying two sacks of wheat was on his way to
the market. After a little while he was tired and they rested under a tree.
When he woke up from his nap he could not see the donkey and started
searching for the donkey everywhere. On the way he met a boy, he
asked the boy, “Have you seen my donkey?” The boy asked, “Is the
donkey's left eye blind, his right foot lame and is he carrying a load of
wheat?” The man was happy and said, “Yes, exactly! Where have you
seen it?” the boy answered “I haven't seen it.” This made the man very
angry and he took the boy to the village chief for punishment.
The judge asked, “Dear boy, if you had not seen at the donkey, how
could you describe it?” The boy answered, “I saw the tracks of a donkey
and the right and left tracks were different from this I understood that
the donkey that passed there was limping. And the grass on the right
side of the road was eaten but the grass on the left was not. From that I
understood that his left eye was blind. There were wheat seeds scattered
on the ground and I understood that he must have been carrying a load of wheat. The judge
understood the boy's cleverness and told the man to forgive the boy.
This story teaches us that we should not be quick to judge the people.
A MERCHANT AND HIS DONKEY
One beautiful spring morning, a merchant loaded his donkey with
bags of salt to go to the market in order to sell them. The merchant
and his donkey were walking along together. They had not walked
far when they reached a river on the road.
Unfortunately, the donkey slipped and fell into the river and noticed
that the bags of salt loaded on his back became lighter.
There was nothing the merchant could do, except return home
where he loaded his donkey with more bags of salt. As they reached
the slippery riverbank, now deliberately, the donkey fell into the
river and wasted all the bags of salt on its back again.
The merchant quickly discovered the donkey's trick. He then
returned home again but re-loaded his donkey with bags of sponges.
The foolish, tricky donkey again set on its way. On reaching the river he again fell into the water.
But instead of the load becoming lighter, it became heavier.
The merchant laughed at him and said: “You foolish donkey,
your trick had been discovered, you should know that,
those who are too clever sometimes over reach themselves.”

One cold, frosty day in the middle of winter a colony
of ants was busy drying out some, grains of corn, which
had grown damp during the wet autumn weather.
A grasshopper half dead with cold and hunger, came
up to one of the ants. “Please give me a grail or two
from your store of corn to save my life,” he said faintly.
“We worked day and night to get this corn in.
Why should I give it to you?” asked the ant crossly.
“Whatever were you doing all last summer when you
should have been gathering your food?”
Oh I didn't have time for things like that, said the
grasshopper. “I was far too busy singing to carry corn about.”
The ant laughed I unkindly. “In that case you can sing all winter as far as I am concerned,” he said.
And without another word he turned back to his work.
Islam teaches us that we should help the less fortunate. But it also teaches us that we
must work hard and not rely on the kindness of others for our daily needs.
THE FOX WHO GOT CAUGHT IN THE TREE TRUNK
Once upon a time, there was a hungry fox that was looking for something to ear. He was very
hungry. No matter how hard he tried, the fox could not find food. Finally he went to the edge of the
forest and searched there for food. Suddenly he caught sight of a big tree with a hole in it.
Inside the hole was a package. The hungry fox immediately thought that there might be food in it,
and he became very happy. He jumped into the hole and when he
opened the package, he saw there were a lot of food, bread, meat
and fruit in it!
An old woodcutter had placed the food in the tree trunk while he
cut down trees in the forest. He was going to eat it for his lunch.
The fox happily began to eat. After the fox had finished eating, he
felt thirsty and decided to leave the trunk and drink some water
from a nearby spring. However, no matter how hard he tried, he
could not get out of the hole. Do you know why? Yes, the fox had
eaten so much food that he became too big to fit through the hole.
The fox was very sad and upset. He told himself, “I wish that I had
thought a little before jumping into the hole.”
Yes children, this is the result of doing something
without thinking about it first.
THE ANT AND THE GRASSHOPPER

Once upon a time in Africa, roosters ruled cats. The cats worked
hard all day and at night they had to bring all they had gathered for
the roosters. The king of the roosters would take all the food for
himself and for the other roosters.
The roosters loved to eat ants. Thus, every cat had a purse hung
round its neck, which it filled with ants for the king of the roosters.
The cats did not like the situation. They wanted to rid themselves of
the king so that the food they gathered through hard work and great
difficulty would be their own. But they were afraid of the roosters.
The roosters had told the cats that rooster's combs were made out of fire and that the fire of their
combs would burn anyone who disobeyed them! The cats believed them and therefore worked from
early morning until night for the roosters.
One night, the fire on the house of Mrs. Cat went out. She told her kitten, Fluffy, to bring some fire
from Mr. Rooster's house. When Fluffy went into the house of the rooster, she saw that Mr. Rooster
was fast asleep, his stomach swollen with the ants he had eaten. The kitten was afraid to wake the
rooster, so she returned home empty handed and told her mother what had happened.
Mrs. Cat said, “Now that the rooster is asleep, gather some dry twigs and place them near his comb.
As soon as the twigs catch fire, bring them home.”
Fluffy gathered some dry twigs and took them to the rooster's house. He was still asleep. Fluffy
fearfully put the dry twigs near the rooster's comb but it was no use, the twigs did not catch fire.
Fluffy rubbed the twigs against the rooster's comb again but it was no use they would not catch fire.
Fluffy returned home without any fire and told her mother, “The roost's comb does not set twigs on
fire.” Mrs. Cat answered “Why can't you do anything right! Come with me I'll show you how to
make fire with the rooster's comb.” So together they went to the house of Mr. Rooster.
He was still asleep. Mrs. Cat put the twigs as near to the rooster's comb as she could. But the twigs
did not catch fire. Then, shaking with fear, she put her paw near the rooster's comb and gently
touched it. To her surprise, the comb was not hot, it was very cold, and it was just red colored.
As soon as Mrs. Cat realized that the roosters had lied to the cats about their combs, she joyfully
went out and told the other cats about the rooster's tricks. From that day on, the cats no longer
worked for the roosters.
At first, the king of the roosters became very angry and said to the cats; “I will burn all of your
houses if you do not work for me!”
But the cats said, “Your comb is not made of fire. It is just the color of fire.
We touched it when you were sleep. You lied to us.”
When the king of the roosters found out that the cats knew that he had
lied to them, he ran away. Now, whenever roosters see a cat, they scurry
away, because to this very day they are afraid of cats.

One beautiful spring day a red rose blossomed in a forest. Many
kinds of trees and plants grew there. As the rose looked around,
a pine tree nearby said, “What a beautiful flower. I wish I was that
lovely.” Another tree said, “Dear pine, do not be sad, we can not
have everything.”
The rose turned its head and remarked, “It seems that I am the
most beautiful plant in this forest.” A sunflower raised its yellow
head and asked, “Why do you say that? In this forest there are
many beautiful plants. You are just one of them.” The red rose
replied, “I see everyone looking at me and admiring me.” Then
the rose looked at a cactus and said, “Look at that ugly plant full
of thorns!” The pine tree said, “Red rose, what kind of talk is this?
Who can say what beauty is? You have thorns too.”
The proud red rose looked angrily at the pine and said, “I thought
you had good taste! You do not know what beauty is at all. You can
not compare my thorns to that of the cactus.”
“What a proud flower”, thought the trees.
The rose tried to move its roots away from the cactus, but it could not move. As the days passed,
the red rose would look at the cactus and say insulting things, like: This plant is useless?
How sorry I am to be his neighbor.
The cactus never got upset and he even tried to advise the rose, saying,
“God did not create any form of life without a purpose.”
Spring passed, and the weather became very warm. Life became difficult in the forest, as the plants
and animals needed water and no rain fell. The red rose began to wilt. One day the rose saw
sparrows stick their beaks into the cactus and then fly away, refreshed. This was puzzling, and the
red rose asked the pine tree what the birds were doing. The pine tree explained that the birds got
water from the cactus. “Does it not hurt when they make holes?” asked the rose.
“Yes, but the cactus does not like to see any birds suffer,” replied the pine.
The rose opened its eyes in wonder and said, “The cactus has water?”
“Yes you can also drink from it. The sparrow can bring
water to you if you ask the cactus for help.”
The red rose felt too ashamed of its past words and
behavior to ask for water from the cactus, but then it
finally did ask the cactus for help. The cactus kindly
agreed and the birds filled their beaks with water and
watered the rose's roots. Thus the rose learned a lesson
and never judged anyone by their appearance again.
THE PROUD RED ROSE
100 Moral Stories 37 www.islamicoccasions.com
Once upon a time, there was a selfish man. He liked everything to be
his own. He could not share his belongings with anyone, not even his
friends or the poor.
One day, the man lost thirty gold coins. He went to his friend's house
and told him how he lost his gold coins. His friend was a kind man.
As his friend's daughter was coming from an errand she found thirty gold coins, when she arrived
home, she told her father what she had found. The girl's father told her that the gold coins belong
to his friend and he sent for him. When the selfish man arrived, he told him how his daughter had
found his thirty gold coins and handed then to him. After counting the gold coins the man said that
ten of them was missing and had been taken by the girl as he had forty gold coins. He further
commented that he will recover the remaining amount from him. But the girl's father refused.
The man left the gold coins and went to the court and informed the judge there about what had
taken place between him and the girl's father.
The judge sent for the girl and her father, and when they arrived asked the girl how many gold
coins did she find. She replied thirty gold coins. The Judge that asked the selfish man how many
gold coins did he lose and he answered forty gold coins.
The judge then told the man that the gold coins did not belong to him because the girl found thirty
and not forty as he claimed to have lost and then told the girl to take the gold coins and that if anybody is looking for them he will send for the girl.
The judge told the man that if anybody reports that they have found forty gold coins he will send
for him. It was then that the man confessed that he lied and that he lost thirty gold coins but the
judge did not listen to him.
This story teaches us to be always honest as dishonest never pays.
YOU ARE PRICELESS TO THOSE WHO LOVE YOU
A well-known speaker started off his seminar by holding up a $20 bill. In the room of
200, he asked, “Who would like this $20 bill?” Hands started going up. He said,
“I am going to give this $20 to one of you but first, let me do this.” He proceeded to
crumple up the $20 bill. He asked, “Who still wants it?” Still hands were up in the air.
“Well, what if I do this?” He dropped it on the ground and started to grind it into the
floor with his shoe. He picked it up, now crumpled and dirty and asked, “Who still
wants it?” Still hands went up into the air.
My friends, we have all learned a very valuable lesson. No matter what was done to
the money, it was still wanted because it did not decrease in value. It was still worth
$20. Many times in our lives, we are dropped, crumpled and ground into the dirt by the decisions
we make and the circumstances that come our way. We may feel as though we are worthless.
But no matter what has happened or will happen, you will never lose your value: dirty or clean,
crumpled or finely creased, you are still priceless to those who love you.
THE SELFISH MAN
100 Moral Stories 38 www.islamicoccasions.com
An emperor in the Far East was growing old and knew it was time to choose his successor.
Instead of choosing one of his assistants or his children, he decided something different.
He called young people in the kingdom together one day. He said, “It is time for me to step down
and choose the next emperor. I have decided to choose one of you.”
The kids were shocked! But the emperor continued. “I am going to
give each one of you a seed today. One very special seed. I want you
to plant the seed, water it and come back here after one year from
today with what you have grown from this one seed. I will then judge
the plants that you bring, and the one I choose will be the next
emperor!”
One boy named Ling was there that day and he, like the others, received a seed. He went home and
excitedly told his mother the story. She helped him get a pot and planting soil, and he planted the
seed and watered it carefully. Every day he would water it and watch to see if it had grown. After
about three weeks, some of the other youths began to talk about their seeds and the plants that
were beginning to grow.
Ling kept checking his seed, but nothing ever grew. 3 weeks, 4 weeks, 5 weeks went by. Still
nothing. By now, others were talking about their plants but Ling didn't have a plant, and he felt
like a failure. Six months went by, still nothing in Ling's pot. He just knew he had killed his seed.
Everyone else had trees and tall plants, but he had nothing. Ling didn't say anything to his friends,
however. He just kept waiting for his seed to grow.
A year finally went by and all the youths of the kingdom brought their plants to the emperor for
inspection. Ling told his mother that he wasn't going to take an empty pot. But honest about what
happened, Ling felt sick to his stomach, but he knew his mother was right. He took his empty pot
to the palace. When Ling arrived, he was amazed at the variety of plants grown by the other youths.
They were beautiful in all shapes and sizes. Ling put his empty pot on the floor and many of the
other kinds laughed at him. A few felt sorry for him and just said, “Hey nice try.”
When the emperor arrived, he surveyed the room and greeted the young people. Ling just tried to
hide in the back. “What great plants, trees and flowers you have grown,” said the emperor. “Today,
one of you will be appointed the next emperor!” All of a sudden, the emperor spotted Ling at the
back of the room with his empty pot. He ordered his guards to bring him to the front. Ling was
terrified. “The emperor knows I'm a failure! Maybe he will have me killed!”
When Ling got to the front, the Emperor asked his name. “My name is Ling,” he replied. All the
kids were laughing and making fun of him. The emperor asked everyone to quiet down. He looked
at Ling, and then announced to the crowd, “Behold your new emperor! His name is Ling!” Ling
couldn't believe it. Ling couldn't even grow his seed. How could he be the new emperor? Then the
emperor said, “One year ago today, I gave everyone here a seed. I told you to take the seed, plant it,
water it, and bring it back to me today. But I gave you all boiled seeds, which would not grow.
All of you, except Ling, have brought me trees and plants and flowers. When you found that the
seed would not grow, you substituted another seed for the one I gave you. Ling was the only one
with the courage and honesty to bring me a pot with my seed in it. Therefore, he is the one who will
be the new emperor!”

GENEROSITY
Mahatma Gandhi went from city to city, village to village collecting funds for
the Charkha Sangh. During one of his tours he addressed a meeting in Orissa.
After his speech a poor old woman got up. She was bent with age, her hair
was grey and her clothes were in tatters. The volunteers tried to stop her,
but she fought her way to the place where Gandhi Ji was sitting.
“I must see him,” she insisted and going up to Gandhi Ji touched his feet.
Then from the folds of her sari she brought out a copper coin and placed it at his feet. Gandhi Ji
picked up the copper coin and put it away carefully. The Charkha Sangh funds were under the
charge of Jamnalal Bajaj. He asked Gandhi Ji for the coin but Gandhi Ji refused.
“I keep cheques worth thousands of rupees for the Charkha Sangh,” Jamnalal Bajaj said laughingly
“yet you won't trust me with a copper coin.” “This copper coin is worth much more than those
thousands” Gandhi Ji said. “If a man has several lakhs and he gives away a thousand or two,
it doesn't mean much.”
But this coin was perhaps all that the poor woman
possessed. She gave me all she had. That was very
generous of her. What a great sacrifice she made. That is
why I value this copper coin more than a crore of rupees.
“Remember your graves because your
way passes over it. You will be dealt with
as you deal with others, you will reap what
you sow, and what you send today will
meet you tomorrow.” Imam Ali (AS)

generous people, because if they fall
down, Allah gives his hand in their hands

In the south of Spain, there was a small village whose people were very joyful and lucky. The
children played under the shade of trees in the gardens of their home. A shepherd boy whose name
was Nasir, stayed near the village with his father, mother and grandmother. Early morning each
day, he takes his herd of goats up the hills to find a suitable place for them to graze. In the
afternoon he would return with them to the village. At night his grandmother would tell him a
story. The story of stars. This story really interested Nasir. As usual, on one of these days, as Nasir
was watching his herd and playing his flute he suddenly saw a wonderful light behind the flower
bush. When he came towards the branches he saw a transparent and most beautiful crystal ball.
The crystal ball was glittering like a colorful rainbow. Nasir carefully took it in
his hand and turned it around. With surprise suddenly he heard a weak voice
coming from the crystal ball. It said; “You can make a wish that your heart
desires and I will fulfill it.” Nasir could not believe that he had actually heard
a voice. But he became so engrossed in his thoughts for he had so many
wishes but he must wish for something which was impossible like the wish to
be able to fly. He said to himself, if I wait till tomorrow I will remember many
things. He put the crystal ball in a bag and gathered the herd, happily returned back
to the village. He decided that he would not tell anyone about the crystal ball. On the following day
also, Nasir could not decide what to wish for, because he really had everything he needed.
The days passed as usual, and Nasir appeared to be very cheerful that the people around him were
amazed to see his cheerful disposition. One day a boy followed Nasir and his herd and hid behind
a tree. Nasir as usual sat in one corner, took out the crystal ball and for a few moments looked at it.
The boy waited for the moment when Nasir would go to sleep. Then he took the crystal ball and ran
away. When he arrived in the village, he called all the people and showed them the crystal ball.
The citizens of that village took the crystal ball in their hand and turned it around with surprise.
Suddenly they heard a voice from inside the crystal ball, which says, “I can fulfill your wish.”
One person took the ball and screamed, “I want one bag full of gold.” Another took the ball and
said loudly, “I want two chest full of jewelry.”
Some of them wished that they would have their own palace with grand door made from pure gold
instead of their old houses. Some also wished for bags full of jewelry, but nobody asked for gardens
in their palaces. All their wishes were fulfilled but still the citizens of the village were not happy.
They were jealous because the person that had a palace had no gold and the person that had the
gold had no palace. For this reason, the citizens of the village were angry and were not speaking to
each other. There was not even one garden which existed in the village where the children could
play. The patience of the children was running out and they were uncomfortable. Nasir and his
family were happy and pleased. Every morning and afternoon he would play the flute.
The children could not wait anymore and decided to return the crystal ball to Nasir. The parents
and neighbors went to him. The children said to Nasir; “When we had a small village we all were
happy and joyful.” The parent also spoke. In one way or another nobody is happy. The expensive
palaces and jewelry only bring us pain. When Nasir saw that the people were really regretful, he
said I have not wished till now, if you really want everything to return to its own place, then I will
wish for it. Everyone happily agreed. Nasir took the crystal ball in his hand turned around and
wished that the village become the same as it was before. Everyone quickly turned towards the
village and saw it became the same old village with gardens full of trees and fruits.
THE CRYSTAL BALL

Once again the people started to live happily and the children played under the shade of trees.
From the next day and everyday at sunset the sound of Nasir's flute could be heard in the village.

THE SIGNS OF HAPPINESS
There was a young couple who led a very happy life together. The only thing that they worried
about was, whether their happiness would last forever or would they too would have to face
problems. One day, they heard that a wise old man had come to town; he could solve all kinds of
problems and guide people. So the couple decided to visit the wise old man and tell him their
source of worry.
The wise old man told them; “Travel around the world and seek a man and a woman who are
perfectly happy as a couple. When you find such a couple, ask them for a piece of cloth from the
man's shirt, then keep that piece of cloth with you, and you always remain happy.”
The young couple began their journey, to find the happiest couple in their world. In one place
they heard that the governor and his wife were the happiest people, so they went to their palace
and asked them, “Are you the happiest couple?”
The governor and his wife replied, “Yes, we are happy in every way except for one thing;
we do not have any children.”
Well that didn't make the governor and his wife the happiest couple. So they continued their
journey. They arrived in one city where they had heard that the happiest couple lived.
They went to their house and asked them, “Are you the happiest couple?”
The couple replied, “Yes, we are really happy in every way except that we have too many children
which make our life a bit uncomfortable.”
No, this couple did not sound to be the happiest. And, so they continued their journey. They visited
many countries, cities, towns and villages asking the same
question but they did not find what they were looking for.
One Day the young couple came across a shepherd in the desert.
The shepherd was grazing his sheep when his wife and child
came along. The shepherd greeted his wife and gently patted
the child she was carrying. She laid the mat and started to eat
contentedly. The young couple came to them and asked them,
“Are you the happiest couple?”
The shepherd and his wife replied, “Nobody is unhappier than
the king.” The young couple immediately realized that they were
the happiest couple and asked them for a piece of the shepherd's
shirt, so that their happiness too would last throughout.
The shepherd said, “If I give you a piece of cloth from my shirt
then I will be left without any clothes since I own just one shirt.”
The young couple at once understood that it is very difficult to
100 Moral Stories 42 www.islamicoccasions.com
find perfect happiness anywhere in the world. The couple decided to return to their own country.
They went to the wise old man and related all that had taken place. They also complained that his
guidance was difficult to abide by.
The wise old man laughed and said, “Was your journey useless or did you learn something from it?”
The young man replied, “Yes, after this trip I have learnt that in this world, nobody is perfectly
happy, only that person is happy who does everything to please God.”
Holy Quran (2:38) says:
“And whosever follows My (Allah's) guidance, on them shall be no fear nor shall they grieve.”
The wife said, “I have learnt that in order to be happy it is important to remember two things;
first, all human beings should be thankful and contented with whatever they have.”
Holy Quran (14:7) says:
“And your Lord declared publicly: if you are grateful, I will add more favors unto you.”
And secondly, for ultimate happiness one must always practice patience.
Holy Quran (2:45) says: “Seek help through patient perseverance and prayers.”
After that, young couple thanked the wise old man for his guidance and returned home. The wise
man prayed for them and said, “Indeed the sign of happiness is in their heart and they have good
manners and if the lifetime is spent in pleasure of God there would be no differences in the existence of mankind.”
Holy Quran (20:123-124) says: “Whosoever follows My (Allah's) guidance, will not loose his way or fall
into misery But whosoever turns away from My message, verily for him is a miserable life.”
HOPE AND GREED
Caliph Haroon Rashid desired that any one who had seen the Holy
Prophet (SAW) in his lifetime be brought before him. After some time
a very old woman was brought before the Caliph. The Caliph asked the
old woman, “Did you see the Prophet yourself?” She said, “Yes! Sir.”
The Caliph then asked her if she remembered any narration from him.
She said yes and said, “When old age comes two things become young,
one is hope and the other is greed.” The Caliph thanked her and gave her
one hundred dinars. The woman thanked Caliph and she was taken back.
Half the way some thought passed through her mind and she desired
to be brought before the Caliph once more. When she was shown in, the
Caliph asked, “Well, why have you come back?” She said. “I just came to
inquire whether the monies you gave me were once for all or is it to continue every year?”
The Caliph thought. “How true is the Prophet's (SAW) word?” she has hope of life even now and
she has greed for money too. The Caliph said, “Don't worry; you will be paid every year.”
She was taken back but on the way she breathed her last.

Once upon a time. There was a rich merchant who had 4 wives. He loved the 4th wife the most and
adorned her with rich robes and treated her to delicacies. He took great care of her & gave her
nothing but the best.
He also loved the 3rd wife very much. He's very proud of her and always wanted to show off her to
his friends. However, the merchant is always in fear that she might run away with some other men.
He too, loved his 2nd wife. She is a very considerate person, always patient & in fact is the
merchant's confidante. Whenever the merchant faced some problems, he always turned to his
2nd wife and she would always help him out and tide him through difficult times.
Now, the merchant's 1st wife is a very loyal partner and has made great contributions in
maintaining his wealth and business as well as taking care of the household. However, the
merchant did not love the 1st wife and although she loved him deeply, he hardly took notice of her.
One day, the merchant fell ill. Before long, he knew that he was going to die soon. He thought of
his luxurious life and told himself, “Now I have 4 wives with me. But when I die, I'll be alone. How
lonely I'll be!” Thus, he asked the 4th wife, “I loved you most, endowed you with the finest clothing
and showered great care over you. Now that I'm dying, will you follow me and keep me company?”
“No way!” replied the 4th wife and she walked away without another
word. Answer cut like a sharp knife right into the merchant's heart.
The sad merchant then asked the 3rd wife, “I have loved you so much
for all my life. Now that I'm dying, will you follow me and keep me
company?”
“No!” replied the 3rd wife. “Life is so good over here! I'm going to
remarry when you die!” The merchant's heart sank and turned cold.
He then asked the 2nd wife, “I always turned to you for help and
you've always helped me out. Now I need your help again. When I die, will you follow me and keep
me company?” “I'm sorry, I can't help you out this time!” replied the 2nd wife.” “At the very most,
I can only send you to your grave.” Answer came like a bolt of thunder & merchant was devastated.
Then a voice called out: “I'll leave with you. I'll follow you no matter where you go.” The merchant
looked up and there was his 1st wife. She was so skinny, almost like she suffered from malnutrition.
Greatly grieved, the merchant said, “I should have taken much better care of you while I could
have!”
Actually, we all have 4 wives in our lives. The 4th wife is our body. No matter how much time and
effort we lavish in making it look good, it'll leave us when we die.
FOUR WIVES
100 Moral Stories 44 www.islamicoccasions.com
Our 3rd wife is our possessions, status and wealth. When we die, they all go to others.
The 2nd wife is our family and friends. No matter how close they had been there for us when
we're alive, the furthest they can stay by us is up to the grave.
The 1st wife is in fact our soul, often neglected in our pursuit of material wealth & sensual pleasure.
Guess what? It is actually the only thing that follows us wherever we go. Perhaps it's a good idea to cultivate and strengthen it now rather than to wait until we're on our deathbed to lament.
LION, RATS, SNAKE & THE HONEYCOMB
Once a man saw in his dream, that a lion was chasing him. The man ran to a tree, climbed on to it
and sat on a branch. He looked down and saw that the lion was still there waiting for him.
The man then looked to his side where the branch he was sitting on was
attached to the tree and saw that two rats were circling around and eating the
branch. One rat was black and the other one was white. The branch would fall
on the ground very soon.
The man then looked below again with fear and discovered that a big black
snake had come & settled directly under him. Snake opened its mouth right
under the man so that he will fall into it.
The man then looked up to see if there was anything that he could hold on to.
He saw another branch with a honeycomb. Drops of honey falling from it.
The man wanted to taste one of the drops. So, he put his tongue out and tasted
one of the fallen drops of honey. The honey was amazing in taste. So, he
wanted to taste another drop. As he did, he got lost into the honey sweetness.
Meanwhile, he forgot about the two rats eating his branch away, the lion on
the ground and the snake that is sitting right under him. After a while, he
woke up from his sleep.
To get the meaning behind this dream, the man went to a pious scholar of
Islam. The scholar said, the lion you saw is your death. It always chases you
and goes wherever you go.
The two rats, one black and one white, are the night and the day. Black one is the night and the
white one is the day. They circle around, coming one after another, to eat your time as they take
you closer to death. The big black snake with a dark mouth is your grave. It's there, just waiting for
you to fall into it. The honeycomb is this world and the sweet honey is the luxuries of this world.
We like to taste a drop of the luxuries of this world but it's very sweet. Then we taste another drop
and yet another.
Meanwhile, we get lost into it and we forget about our time,
we forget about our death and we forget about our graves.
“This world is like a serpent, so soft to touch, but so full of lethal poison. Unwise people are allured
by it and drawn towards it, and wise men avoid it and keep away from its poisonous effects.”
Imam Ali (AS)

One day a young man was standing in the middle of the town proclaiming that he had the most
beautiful heart in the whole valley.
A large crowd gathered and they all admired his heart for it was perfect. There was not a mark or a
flaw in it. Yes, they all agreed it truly was the most beautiful heart they had ever seen.
The young man was very proud and boasted more loudly about his beautiful heart.
Suddenly, an old man appeared at the front of the crowd and said, “Why your heart is not nearly as
beautiful as mine.”
The crowd and the young man looked at the old man's heart. It was beating strongly ... but full of
scars. It had places where pieces had been removed and other pieces put in ... but they didn't fit
quite right and there were several jagged edges.
In fact, in some places there were deep gouges where whole pieces were
missing. The people starred ... how could he say his heart is more beautiful,
they thought?
The young man looked at the old man's heart and saw its state and laughed.
“You must be joking,” he said. “Compare your heart with mine ... mine is
perfect and yours is a mess of scars and tears.”
“Yes,” said the old man, “Yours is perfect looking ... but I would never trade with you. You see,
every scar represents a person to whom I have given my love..... I tear out a piece of my heart and
give it to them ... and often they give me a piece of their heart which fits into the empty place in my
heart ... but because the pieces aren't exact, I have some rough edges, which I cherish, because they
remind me of the love we shared.
Sometimes I have given pieces of my heart away ... and the other person hasn't returned a piece of
his heart to me. These are the empty gouges ... giving love is taking a chance. Although these
gouges are painful, they stay open, reminding me of the love I have for these people too ... and I
hope someday they may return and fill the space I have waiting. So now do you see what true
beauty is?”
The young man stood silently with tears running down his cheeks. He walked up to the old man,
reached into his perfect young and beautiful heart, and ripped a piece out. He offered it to the old
man with trembling hands.
The old man took his offering, placed it in his heart and then took a piece from his old scarred
heart and placed it in the wound in the young man's heart. It fit .... but not perfectly, as there were
some jagged edges.
The young man looked at his heart, not perfect anymore but more beautiful than ever, since love
from the old man's heart flowed into his. They embraced and walked away side by side.
Physical perfection is not always beautiful.

Some time ago, there lived a King. This King should have been contented with his life, given all
the riches and luxuries he had. However, this was not the case! The King always found himself
wondering why he just never seemed content with his life.
Sure, he had the attention of everyone wherever he went, attended fancy dinners and parties,
but somehow, he still felt something was lacking and he couldn't put his finger on it.
One day, the King had woken up earlier than usual to stroll around his palace. He entered his huge
living room and came to a stop when he heard someone happily singing away... following this
singing... he saw that one of the servants was singing and had a very contented look on his face.
This fascinated the King and he summoned this man to his chambers. The man
entered the King's chambers as ordered. The King asked why he was so happy?
To this the man replied: “Your Majesty, I am nothing but a servant, but I make
enough of a living to keep my wife and children happy. We don't need too
much, a roof over our heads and warm food to fill our tummy. My wife and
children are my inspiration; they are content with whatever little I bring home.
I am happy because my family is happy.”
Hearing this, the King dismissed the servant and summoned his Personal Assistant to his
chambers.
The King related his personal anguish about his feelings and then related the story of the servant to
his Personal Assistant, hoping that somehow, he will be able to come up with some reasoning that
here was a King who could have anything he wished for at a snap of his fingers and yet was not
contented, whereas, his servant, having so little was extremely contented.
The Personal Assistant listened attentively and came to a conclusion. He said, “Your Majesty,
I believe that the servant has not been made part of The 99 Club.”
“The 99 Club? And what exactly is that?” the King inquired.
To which the Assistant replied, “Your Majesty, to truly know what The 99 Club is, you will have to
do the following... place 99 Gold coins in a bag and leave it at this servant's doorstep, you will then
understand what The 99 Club is.”
That very same evening, the King arranged for 99 Gold coins to be placed in a bag at the servant's
doorstep. Although he was slightly hesitant and he thought he should have put 100 Gold coins into
the bag, but since his assistant had advised him to put 99 that is what he did.
The servant was just stepping out of his house when he saw a bag at his doorstep. Wondering about
its contents, he took it into his house and opened the bag. When he opened the bag, he let out a
great big shout of joy...Gold Coins... so many of them. He could hardly believe it. He called his wife
to show her the coins.
He then took the bag to a table and emptied it out and began to count the coins. Doing so,
THE CLUB 99
100 Moral Stories 47 www.islamicoccasions.com
he realized that there were 99 coins and he thought it was an odd number so he counted again, and
again and again only to come to the same conclusion... 99 Gold Coins.
He began to wonder, what could have happened to that last one coin? For no one would leave 99
coins. He began to search his entire house, looked around his backyard for hours, not wanting to
lose out on that one coin. Finally, exhausted, he decided that he was going to have to work harder
than ever to make up for that one Gold coin to make his entire collection an even 100 Gold Coins.
He got up the next morning, in an extremely horrible mood, shouting at the children and his wife
for his delay, not realizing that he had spent most of the night conjuring ways of working hard so
that he had enough money to buy himself that gold coin. He went to work as usual - but not in his
usual best mood, singing happily - as he grumpily did his daily errands.
Seeing the man's attitude change so drastically, the King was puzzled. He promptly summoned his
assistant to his chambers. The King related his thoughts about the servant and once again, his
assistant listened. The King could not believe that the servant who until yesterday had been singing
away and was happy and content with his life had taken a sudden change of attitude, even though
he should have been happier after receiving the gold coins.
To this the assistant replied “Ah! But your Majesty, the servant has now officially joined The 99
Club.” He explained: “The 99 Club is just a name given to those people who have everything but
yet are never contented, therefore they are always working hard and striving for that extra one to
round it out to 100!
We have so much to be thankful for and we can live with very little in our lives, but the minute we
are given something bigger and better, we want even more!
We are not the same happy contented person we used to be, we want more and more and by
wanting more and more we don't realize the price we pay for it. We lose our sleep, our happiness;
we hurt the people around us just as a price to pay for our growing needs and desires. That is what
joining The 99 Club is all about.”
Hearing this King decided that from that day onwards, he was going to start appreciating all the
little things in life.
Striving for more is always good, but let's not strive so hard and for so much that we loses all those
near and dear to our hearts, we shouldn't compromise our happiness for moments of luxuries!
REPENTANCE
A person once heard a pious Muslim say that “For the last thirty years
I am repenting for a sin and I don't know how Allah will deal with me regarding it?”
The listener asked: “What was your sin?”
The pious Muslim said: “I used to have a shop in the Bazaar. One day I heard that the
whole Bazaar was burning so I rushed to see my shop. When I reached there I saw that
except my shop all the shops were razed to the ground. I said ‘Al-Hamdo lillah' (All praise to Allah);
but immediately I realized my mistake. How can I call myself a Muslim when I couldn't feel the loss
of my neighbors? That is why I am repenting for that lapse on my part for the last thirty years.”

Sayyed Jawad Ameli, a great Mujtahid, was having his dinner when someone knocked at his door.
A servant from his master, Ayatullah Sayyed Mehdi Bahrul Uloom, appeared and said: “Your
master has sent for you to come immediately. He has just sat down for his dinner but refuses to
eat until he sees you.”
There was no time to lose. Sayyed Jawad Ameli left his dinner and rushed to
Ayatullah Bahrul Uloom's residence. Just as he entered, the master looked
disapprovingly at him and said: “Sayyed Jawad! You have no fear of Allah!
Don't you feel ashamed in front of Allah?” This came as a shock to him, as he
could not remember doing anything to incur the wrath of his master.
He said: “My master may guide me where I have failed.”
Ayatullah Bahrul Uloom replied: “It is now a week that your neighbor and his family are without
wheat and rice. He was trying to buy some dates from a shop on credit but the shopkeeper refused
to grant him any more credit. He returned home empty-handed and the family is without a morsel
of food.” Sayed Jawad was taken by surprise. “By Allah,” he said, “I have no knowledge about this.”
That is why I am displeased all the more. How can you be unaware of your own neighbor? Seven
days of difficulties have passed and you tell me you do not know about it. Well, If you had known
and ignored him despite your knowledge, then you would not even he a Muslim, Ayatullah Uloom
adjoined. Then he instructed him to take all the dishes of food before him to his neighbor. “Sit with
him to eat, so that he does not feel ashamed. And take this sum for his future ration. Place it under
his pillow or carpet so that he is not humiliated, and inform me when this work is completed, for
not until then shall I eat.” “That man is not from me who sleeps contentedly while his
neighbor sleeps hungry.” Holy Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him)
A BOX FULL OF KISSES
The story goes back some time ago, a man punished his 3-year-old daughter for
wasting a roll of gold wrapping paper. Money was tight and he became infuriated
when the child tried to decorate a box to put under the Christmas tree. Nevertheless,
the little girl brought the gift to her father the next morning and said, “This is for
you, Daddy.”
The man was embarrassed by his earlier over reaction, but his anger flared again when he found
out the box was empty. He yelled at her, stating, “Don't you know, when you give someone a
present, there is supposed to be something inside?” The little girl looked up at him with tears in
her eyes and cried, “Oh, Daddy, it's not empty at all. I blew kisses into the box. They're all for you,
Daddy.” The father was crushed. He put his arms around his little girl, and he begged for her
forgiveness.
Only a short time later, an accident took the life of the child. It is also told that her father kept that
gold box by his bed for many years and, whenever he was discouraged, he would take out an
imaginary kiss and remember the love of the child who had put it there.
In a very real sense, each one of us, as humans beings, have been given a gold container filled with
unconditional love and kisses... from our children, family members, friends, and God. There is
simply no other possession, anyone could hold, more precious than this.
THE NEIGHBOR
100 Moral Stories 49 www.islamicoccasions.com
There was a green and fresh pasture, in which three cows lived, a white cow, a black cow and a
reddish-brown one. The cows were kind to each other. They were nice to each other. They used to
graze in the meadow together. and they used to sleep near each other.
Till it happened one day, the reddish-brown colored lion of the forest happened to pass that way.
The lion was unhappy. It was hungry, and was looking for a prey. On catching sight of the cows it
became glad, but couldn't attack them, because they were together. So, the lion sat in a corner and
waited till the cows would separate from each other.
The cows were together and wouldn't part away from each other, because they knew that if they
were together, no predator could attack them. The lion lay in ambush nearby for two or three days.
But the cows continued to remain together, and wouldn't separate from each other. The lion
became unhappy.
A plan occurred to it. It went towards the cows, greeted them
and said: “How are you my friends?” Are you fine? I have
been remembering you for a long time, but because I am too
busy, I can't come to you and ask about your health.
Today I said to myself: “Anyhow I should come and see you
from near and visit you.” The reddish-brown cow said: “Sir,
your coming has really pleased us and brightened our pasture.”
The lion said: “I have always remembered you, and have even ordered a better pasture made ready
for you.” Reddish-brown cow said: “Sir, you have really obliged us and we are very thankful to you.”
Both the white and the black cows were troubled by what their friend, the reddish-brown cow said,
and were grieved at its thoughtlessness. They feared lest it should be deceived.
They said to each other: Which forest has not got a better pasture? Why does the reddish-brown
cow believe what the lion says? Doesn't it know that lions seek other animals only to prey on them?
The reddish-brown cow became more and more a close friend of the lion each day.
The black cow and the white cow advised it as much as they could, but with no avail.
One day the lion said to the reddish-brown cow: “You know that the color of our bodies is dark
and that the color of the body of the white cow is light, and you also know that the light color is the
opposite of the dark color. It would be very good if I eat the white cow, so that there will be no
difference among us any longer and that we will be able to live together well.”
The reddish-brown cow accepted the saying of the selfish lion and started talking to the black cow
to keep it busy, so that the lion could eat the white cow with more ease. The white cow was left
alone and was killed, while the black and the reddish-brown cows were busy with idle talks.
Two or three days passed since the lion had devoured the white cow. The lion, angry and uneasy,
was lying in a corner, and the reddish-brown cow was moving around the lion and grazing. The lion
called the reddish-brown cow. The cow answered: “Yes sir!”
THE THREE COWS
100 Moral Stories 50 www.islamicoccasions.com
The lion said: “The color of my body and the color of your body are reddish-brown, and black does
not go with our color. It will be very good if I eat the black cow, so that in this forest we all will be
of the same color.” The reddish-brown cow accepted and moved away from the black cow.
The lion attacked and devoured the black cow, too. And as for the reddish-brown cow, it was so
filled with joy that it didn't know what to do. It roamed and grazed and said to itself: “It is only
me who has the color of the lion...” A few days passed since the black cow had been devoured by
the lion. The lion roared and said. “O the reddish-brown cow! Where are you?”
The reddish-brown cow, shaking with fear, went forward and said: “Yes sir!” The lion said: “Today
it is your turn, get yourself ready, I am going to eat you.” The reddish-brown cow, with great fear &
horror said: “Why sir, I am your friend. I did whatever you said. So why do you want to eat me?”
The lion roared and said: “Friend of a friendless!” How is it possible that a lion makes friendship
with a cow? No matter how much the reddish-brown cow begged and entreated, the lion didn't
accept its words. The lion attacked the cow.
The cow said: “Mr. Lion, please allow me to cry out three times before you eat me.” The lion said:
“Quickly, quickly!” The reddish-brown cow cried out: “I was eaten the very day the white cow was
eaten. I was eaten the very day the black cow was eaten. I was eaten the very day I made.... with
you.” The lion devoured the reddish-brown cow very quickly. Then it said to itself: “I have finished
my job in this forest. Now I had better go to other forests.” Divide and rule policy.
A WHITE HAS NO SUPERIORITY OVER A BLACK
The following scene took place on a BA flight between Johannesburg and
London. A white woman, about 50 years old, was seated next to a black
man. Obviously disturbed by this, she called the air Hostess. Madam,
what is the matter, the hostess asked you obviously do not see it then?
She responded. You placed me next to a black man. I do not agree to sit next to someone from such
a repugnant group. Give me an alternative seat. Be calm please, the hostess replied.
Almost all the places on this flight are taken. I will go to see if another place is available. The
Hostess went away and then came back a few minutes later. Madam, just as I thought, there are no
other available seats in the economy class. I spoke to the captain and he informed me that there is
also no seat in the business class. All the same, we still have one place in the first class.
Before the woman could say anything, the hostess continued. It is not usual for our company to
permit someone from the economy class to sit in the first class However, given the circumstances;
the captain feels that it would be scandalous to make someone sit next to someone so disgusting.
She turned to the black guy, and said. Therefore, Sir, if you would like to, please take your hand
luggage because a seat awaits you in the first class. At the moment, the other passengers who were
shocked by what they had just witnessed stood up and applauded.
This is a true story against racism, which is not usually told. All mankind is from Adam and Eve; an
Arab has no superiority over a non-Arab, nor a non-Arab has any superiority over an Arab; also a
white has no superiority over a black, nor does a black have any superiority over white except by
piety and good action. Learn that every Muslim is the brother of another Muslim, and that Muslims
constitute one brotherhood.

Ghulamhusein was a popular social figure and a keen host of guests coming to him from distant
lands. He lived in Moshi, a beautiful small town at the foot of Mt. Kilimanjaro in Tanzania. He was
generous and hospitable to one and all. One of his hobbies during leisure hours particularly on
Saturdays and Sundays was to play the game of cards with his friends. For hours they used to get
together where they enjoyed the game. It was not with the aim of gambling but rather just for
pleasure and pass time.
Once in the midst of a lively game of cards, his servant came to inform him that a guest of his was
seriously ill at the guest house and needed his immediate attention. He sent the servant back saying
he would come soon. But he was so much engrossed to withdraw from it. So he continued to play
with keen interest.
After a while, his servant came again to report that the condition of the guest was
deteriorating and needed his urgent attention as there was no one else to attend.
But Ghulamhusein was so deeply engrossed in the game that he did not want to be
disturbed. As such, again he sent the servant back promising to come soon.
By the time he could be free from the very mind captivating game of cards, the
servant came for the third time. But this time he reported that the guest of his a
poor traveler from distant lands had already died. This news gave a shock of his life to
Ghulamhusein. It convinced him of the evil and harmful effect of such an indoor game. There and
then he vowed never to indulge himself in such a game.
Is this not an eye-opening example of an intoxicating and mentally distracting game of cards,
commonly played today either as a pass-time or for gambling purposes? Perhaps it also explains
the philosophy behind absolute Islamic forbiddance to play or watch such a game, even without
the chance of gaining or losing money. It is meant to be prevention than a cure, lest man is one day
tempted to use the game for gambling purpose.
FINDERS KEEPERS
A wise woman who was traveling in the
mountains found a precious stone in a stream. The next day she met another traveler
who was hungry, and the wise woman opened her bag to share her food. The hungry
traveler saw the precious stone & asked the woman to give it to him. She did so without hesitation.
The traveler left, rejoicing his good fortune. He knew the stone was worth enough to give him
security for a lifetime. But a few days later he came back to return the stone to the wise woman.
“I've been thinking,” He said, “I know how valuable the stone is, but I give it back in the hope that
you can give me something even more precious: Give me what you have within you that enabled
you to give me the stone.”
BANDAGE OF COMPLAINT!
Once a saint saw a man with a bandage tied round his head. “Why have you tied the bandage?” he
asked. “Because my head aches,” the man replied. “How old are you?” he demanded. “Thirty,” he
replied. “Have you been in pain and anguish the greater part of your life?” he enquired. “No,” the
man answered. “For thirty years you have enjoyed good health,” he remarked, “and you never tied
the bandage of thankfulness. Now because of this one night head ache, that you have, you tie the
bandage of complaint!”
GHULAMHUSSEIN AND THE GAME OF CHANCE
"Abstention from sins is better than
seeking help afterward." Imam Ali (AS)
100 Moral Stories 52 www.islamicoccasions.com
Sikaki was a skilled artist an artisan. With great expertise and interest, he made such a nice and
beautiful inkpot that it could be presented to the king. He expected that, appreciating his artistic
skill, the king would encourage him as far as possible. So, with countless hopes and thousand of
desires, he presented that inkpot to the king. In the beginning the king was very impressed by his
artistic skill but afterwards an unpleasant event occurred that caused an extraordinary change in
Sikaki' s life and way of thinking.
When the king was observing the skilled artistry of the beautiful inkpot and Sikaki was lost in the
world of thoughts, the people informed that a scholar-literary person or jury is about to enter the
court. As soon as the scholar entered, the king got so much absorbed in welcoming and talking to
him that he forgot Sikaki and his skilled artistry. This incident caused an adverse and deep effect
on the heart of Sikaki.
He realized that now he would not receive the encouragement he had expected and all his desires
and hopes are useless now. But Sikaki's high spirited mind did not allow him to be in peace, so he
started thinking as to what should he do. He decided to do what the others have done and go on the
same way that the others have gone (uptill now). Therefore, he decided to search for his lost hopes
in the world of knowledge, literature and books. Although for a wise man who has passed the days
of his young age, it was not easy to study with young children and to start right from the
preliminary stage. But he did not have a choice . After all whenever the fish is taken out of water,
it is fresh.
Worse than that, in the beginning he did not find any sort of interest in himself regarding reading
and writing. Perhaps spending a long time in artistic works and handicraft was the reason for
stagnancy in his scientific and literary talent. But neither his advanced age nor lack of capability,
none of these could change his decision. With great enthusiasm and zeal for attaining knowledge,
he strictly got busy with his studies, until another incident occurred:
The teacher who was teaching him Shafi'e jurisprudence (fiqh Shafi'e), taught him this lesson:
“The teacher believes that the skin of a dog becomes clean (tahir) after tanning.” Sikaki repeated
this sentence a lot of times so that at the time of examination he should be able to succeed. But
when he was asked to answer this question, he said: “The dog believes that the skin of a teacher
becomes clean after tanning.”
The audience upon hearing this answer started laughing. It was clear for everybody that this old
man is absolutely incapable of reading and writing. After this incident Sikaki not only left the
school , but he left the town and went towards the Jungle. By chance, he reached the
foot of a mountain, where he saw that the water is falling drop by drop from the top
and due to the continuous falling of water, a hole had been formed in that hard stone.
He reflected for sometime, a good idea crossed his mind like lightning. And he said:
“Maybe my heart is not ready to accept (knowledge) but it is not harder than this
stone. It is impossible that continuous studying and hard work would be ineffective.”
Therefore, he came back and with hard work, he got busy in the attainment of
knowledge. As a result he was reckoned as one of the popular scholars of his time.
You never be too old to learn something new.

A woman came out of her house and saw 3 old men with long white beards sitting in her front yard.
She did not recognize them. She said “I don't think I know you, but you must be hungry.
Please come in and have something to eat.”
“Is the man of the house home?”, they asked.
“No,” she replied. “He's out.”
“Then we cannot come in,” they replied.
In the evening when her husband came home,
she told him what had happened.
“Go tell them I am home and invite them in!”
The woman went out and invited the men in.
“We do not go into a House together,” they replied.
“Why is that?” she asked.
One of the old men explained: “His name is Wealth,” he said pointing to one of his friends, and said
pointing to another one, “He is Success, and I am Love.” Then he added, “Now go in and discuss
with your husband which one of us you want in your home.”
The woman went in and told her husband what was said. Her husband was overjoyed. “How nice!,”
he said. “Since that is the case, let us invite Wealth. Let him come and fill our home with wealth!”
His wife disagreed. “My dear, why don't we invite Success?”
Their daughter-in-law was listening from the other corner of the house. She jumped in with her
own suggestion: “Would it not be better to invite Love? Our home will then be filled with love!”
“Let us heed our daughter-in-law's advice,” said the husband to his wife.
“Go out and invite Love to be our guest.”
The woman went out and asked the 3 old men,
“Which one of you is Love? Please come in and be our guest.”
Love got up and started walking toward the house. The other 2 also got up and followed him.
Surprised, the lady asked Wealth and Success: “I only invited Love, Why are you coming in?”
The old men replied together: “If you had invited Wealth or Success, the other two of us would've
stayed out, but since you invited Love, wherever He goes, we go with him. Wherever there is Love,
there is also Wealth and Success!!!”

Once upon a time, there was an island where all the feelings lived: Happiness, Sadness, Knowledge,
and all of the others, including Love. One day it was announced to the feelings that the island
would sink, so all constructed boats and left. Except for Love.
Love was the only one who stayed. Love wanted to hold out until the last possible moment. When
the island had almost sunk, Love decided to ask for help.
Richness was passing by Love in a grand boat. Love said, “Richness, can you take me with you?”
Richness answered, “No, I can't. There is a lot of gold and silver in my boat. There is no place here
for you.”
Love decided to ask Vanity who was also passing by in a beautiful vessel. “Vanity, please help me!”
“I can't help you, Love. You are all wet and might damage my boat,” Vanity answered.
Sadness was close by so Love asked, “Sadness, let me go with you.” “Oh . . . Love, I am so sad that
I need to be by myself!” Happiness passed by Love, too, but she was so happy that she did not even
hear when Love called her.
Suddenly, there was a voice, “Come, Love, I will take you.” It was an elder.
So blessed and overjoyed, Love even forgot to ask the elder where they were
going. When they arrived at dry land, the elder went his own way. Realizing
how much was owed the elder, Love asked Knowledge, another elder, “Who
Helped me?”
“It was Time,” Knowledge answered.
“Time?” asked Love. “But why did Time help me?” Knowledge smiled with deep wisdom and
answered, “Because only Time is capable of understanding how valuable Love is.”

When things in your life seem almost too much to handle, when 24 hours in a day are
not enough, remember the mayonnaise Jar...and the Coffee...
A professor stood before his philosophy class and had some items
in front of him. When the class began, wordlessly, he picked up a
very large and empty mayonnaise Jar and proceeded to fill it with
golf balls.
He then asked the students if the Jar was full. They agreed that it was. So the professor then picked
up a box of pebbles and poured them into the Jar. He shook the Jar lightly. The pebbles rolled into
the open areas between the golf balls. He then asked the students again if the Jar was full. They
agreed it was.
The professor next picked up a box of sand and poured it into the Jar. Of course, the sand filled up
everything else. He asked once more if the Jar was full. The students responded unanimous “yes.”
The professor then produced two cups of Coffee from under the table and poured the entire
contents into the Jar, effectively filling the empty space between the sand. The students laughed.
“Now,” said the professor, as the laughter subsided, “I want you to recognize that this Jar
represents your life. The golf balls are the important things, your God, family, your children, your
health, your friends, and your favorite passions things that if everything else was lost and only they
remained, your life would still be full.” The pebbles are the other things that matter like your job,
your house, and your car. The sand is everything else the small stuff.
“If you put the sand into the Jar first,” he continued, “there is no room for the pebbles or the golf
balls.” The same goes for life. If you spend all your time and energy on the small stuff, you will
never have room for the things that are important. Pay attention to the things that are critical to
your happiness. Play with your children. Take care of the golf balls first, the things that really
matter. Set your priorities. The rest is just sand.
One of the students raised her hand and inquired what the Coffee represented. The professor
smiled. “I'm glad you asked. It just goes to show you that no matter how full your life may seem,
there's always room for a couple of cups of Coffee with a friends.”
THE BAR
A tale is told about a small town that had historically been “dry,”
(no alcohol sold) but then a local businessman decided to build a
tavern. A group of Christians from a local church were concerned
and planned an all-night prayer meeting to ask God to intervene.
It just so happened that shortly thereafter lightning struck the bar and it burned to the ground.
The owner of the bar sued the church, claiming that the prayers of the congregation were
responsible, but the church hired a lawyer to argue in court that they were not responsible.
The presiding judge, after his initial review of the case, stated that “No matter how this case comes
out, one thing is clear. The tavern owner believes in prayer and the Christians do not.”
THE MAYONNAISE AND THE COFFEE
100 Moral Stories 56 www.islamicoccasions.com
There was a man who had four sons. He wanted his sons to learn not to
judge things too quickly. So he sent them each on a quest, in turn, to go
and look at a pear tree that was a great distance away. The first son
went in the winter, the second in the spring, the third in summer, and
the youngest son in the fall.
When they had all gone and come back, he called them together to
describe what they had seen. The first son said that the tree was ugly,
bent, and twisted. The second son said no it was covered with green
buds and full of promise. The third son disagreed; he said it was laden with blossoms that smelled
so sweet and looked so beautiful, it was the most graceful thing he had ever seen. The last son
disagreed with all of them; he said it was ripe and drooping with fruit, full of life and fulfillment.
The man then explained to his sons that they were all right, because they had each seen but only
one season in the tree's life. He told them that you cannot judge a tree, or a person, by only one
season, and that the essence of who they are and the pleasure, joy, and love that come from that
life can only be measured at the end, when all the seasons are up.
If you give up when it's winter, you will miss the promise of your spring, the beauty of your
summer, fulfillment of your fall. Don't let the pain of one season destroy the joy of all the rest.
Don't judge life by one difficult season. Persevere through the difficult patches and better times are
sure to come some time or later.
THE ROSE WITHIN
A certain man planted a rose and watered it faithfully and before it blossomed,
he examined it. He saw the bud that would soon blossom, but noticed thorns
upon the stem and he thought, “How can any beautiful flower come from a
plant burdened with so many sharp thorns?” Saddened by this thought, he
neglected to water the rose, and just before it was ready to bloom... it died.
So it is with many people. Within every soul there is a rose. The good qualities planted in us at
birth, grow amid the thorns of our faults. Many of us look at ourselves and see only the thorns,
the defects.
We despair, thinking that nothing good can possibly come from us. We neglect to water the good
within us, and eventually it dies. We never realize our potential.
Some people do not see the rose within themselves; someone else must show it to them. One of the
greatest gifts a person can possess is to be able to reach past the thorns of another, and find the
rose within them.
This is one of the characteristic of love... to look at a person, know their true faults and accepting
that person into your life... all the while recognizing the nobility in their soul. Help others to realize
they can overcome their faults. If we show them the “rose” within themselves, they will conquer
their thorns. Only then will they blossom many times over.

A professor began his class by holding up a glass with some water in it. He held it up for all to see
and asked the students, “How much do you think this glass weighs?”
‘50 gms!'.... ‘100 gms!'...... ‘125 gms' ...... the students answered.
“I really don't know unless I weigh it,” said the professor, “but, my question
is: What would happen if I held it up like this for a few minutes?”
“Nothing” the students said.
“Ok! What would happen if I held it up like this for an hour?” the professor
asked. “Your arm would begin to ache,” said one of the students.
“You're right, now what would happen if I held it for a day?”
“Your arm could go numb, you might have severe muscle stress and paralysis and have to go to
hospital for sure!” ventured another student; and all the students laughed.
“Very good. But during all this, did the weight of the glass change?” asked the professor.
“No” the students said.
“Then what caused the arm ache and the muscle stress?” The students were puzzled.
“Put the glass down!” said one of the students.
“Exactly!” said the professor. “Life's problems are something like this. Hold it for a few minutes in
your head and they seem okay. Think of them for a long time and they begin to ache. Hold it even
longer and they begin to paralyze you. You will not be able to do anything.”
“It's important to think of the challenges (problems) in your life, but EVEN MORE IMPORTANT is
to have trust in Allah (swt) and to ‘put them down' at the end of every day before you go to sleep.
That way, you are not stressed, you wake up every day fresh and strong and can handle any issue,
any challenge that comes your way!”
So, as it becomes time for you to leave office today, Remember friend to “PUT THE GLASS DOWN
TODAY” and have tranquility by putting trust in Almighty Allah (swt).
Holy Quran (48:4) says: “He it is who sent down tranquility into the hearts of the believers that
they might have more faith added to their faith.” Tranquility is sign of strong faith while worries
and stress is sign of weak faith. Tell to your mind every day before you go to sleep: “YAA
AYYATUHAN NAFSUL MUTMAINNAH, IRJI'II ILAA RABBIKI RADHIYATAN MARDHIYYAH,
FADKHULII FII IBAADII WADKHULII JANNATII”. (Al-Fajr 89:27-30)
“O soul that is at rest satisfied. Return to your Lord well-pleased (with Him), well-pleasing (Him).
So, enter among My servants, and enter into my Paradise.”
By worrying so much, do not turn your life to hell. Good luck.
PUT THE GLASS DOWN!
100 Moral Stories 58 www.islamicoccasions.com
It was a bitter, cold evening. The old man's beard was glazed by winter's frost while he waited for
a ride across the river. The wait seemed endless. His body became numb and stiff from the frigid
north wind. He heard the faint, steady rhythm of approaching hooves galloping along the frozen
path.
Anxiously, he watched as several horsemen rounded the bend. He let the first one pass by without
an effort to get his attention. Then another passed by... and another.
Finally, the last rider neared the spot where the old man sat like a
snow statue.
As this one drew near, the old man caught the rider's eye and said,
“Sir, would you mind giving an old man a ride to the other side?
There doesn't appear to be a passageway by foot.”
Reining his horse, the rider replied, “Sure thing. Hop aboard.”
Seeing the old man was unable to lift his half-frozen body from the ground, the horseman
dismounted and helped the old man onto the horse. The horseman took the old man not just across
the river, but to his destination, which was just a few miles away.
As they neared the tiny but cozy cottage, the horseman's curiosity caused him to inquire, “Sir, I
notice that you let several other riders pass by without making an effort to secure a ride. Then I
came up and you immediately asked me for a ride. I'm curious why, on such a bitter winter night;
you would wait and ask the last rider. What if I had refused and left you there?”
The old man lowered himself slowly down from the horse, looked the rider straight in the eyes, and
replied, “I've been around here for some time. I reckon I know people pretty good.”
The old-timer continued, “I looked into the eyes of the other riders and immediately saw there was
no concern for my situation. It would have been useless even to ask them for a ride. But when I
looked into your eyes, kindness and compassion were evident. I knew, then and there, that your
gentle spirit would welcome the opportunity to give me assistance in my time of need.”
Those heartwarming comments touched the horseman deeply.
“I'm most grateful for what you have said,” he told the old man. “May I never get too busy in my
own affairs that I fail to respond to the needs of others with kindness and compassion.”
Ya Allah, Make me among those about whom the Holy Quran (Hashr 59:9) has said: “And they give
them preference over their own selves even though they are in need.”
DON'T WE ALL
I was parked in front of the mall wiping off my car. I had just come from the car wash and was
waiting for my wife to get out of work. Coming my way from across the parking lot was what society
would consider a bum. From the looks of him, he had no car, no home, no clean clothes, and no
money.
MAY I NEVER GET TOO BUSY IN MY OWN AFFAIRS!
100 Moral Stories 59 www.islamicoccasions.com
There are times when you feel generous but there are other times that you
just don't want to be bothered. This was one of those “don't want to be
bothered times.”
“I hope he doesn't ask me for any money,” I thought. He didn't.
He came and sat on the curb in front of the bus
stop but he didn't look like he could have enough
money to even ride the bus. After a few minutes he
spoke. “That's a very pretty car,” he said.
He was ragged but he had an air of dignity around
him. His scraggly blond beard keeps more than his face warm.
I said, “Thanks,” and continued wiping off my car.
He sat there quietly as I worked. The expected plea for money never came.
As the silence between us widened something inside said, “Ask him if he needs any help.”
I was sure that he would say “yes” but I held true to the inner voice.
“Do you need any help?” I asked.
He answered in three simple but profound words that I shall never forget. We often look for
wisdom in great men and women. We expect it from those of higher learning and accomplishments.
I expected nothing but an outstretched grimy hand. He spoke the three words that shook me.
“Don't we all?” he said.
I was feeling high and mighty, successful and important, above a bum in the street, until those
three words hit me like a twelve gauge shotgun. Don't we all?
I needed help. Maybe not for bus fare or a place to sleep, but I needed help. I reached in my wallet
and gave him not only enough for bus fare, but enough to get a warm meal and shelter for the day.
Those three little words still ring true. No matter how much you have, no matter how much you
have accomplished, you need help too. No matter how little you have, no matter how loaded you
are with problems, even without money or a place to sleep, you can give help.
Even if it's just a compliment, you can give that. You never know when you may see someone that
appears to have it all. They are waiting on you to give them what they don't have. A different
perspective on life, a glimpse at something beautiful, a respite from daily chaos, that only you
through a torn world can see.
Maybe the man was just a homeless stranger wandering the streets. Maybe he was more than that.
maybe he was sent by a power that is great and wise, to messenger to a soul too comfortable in
themselves. Maybe God looked down, called an Angel, dressed him like a bum, and then said,
“Go messenger to that man cleaning the car, that man needs help.” Don't we all?
“.....Even a smile can be charity.....” Holy Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him)

THE STRANGER IN THE GARDEN
Once upon a time there was a man who had a big garden. He had planted many fruit trees and
cared for them till they bear fruits. Now he wanted to pick up the fruits and sell them to make
money for his family.
One fine day while picking fruits with his son, the man saw a stranger
sitting on the branch of a tree and picking the fruits. This man become
angry and shouted, “Hey you! What are you doing on my tree? Aren't you
ashamed of stealing fruits in the day time?” The stranger on the branch
just looked at the gardener but didn't reply, and continued picking the
fruits. The gardener was very angry and shouted again, “For a whole year
I have taken care of these trees, you have no right to take the fruits without
my permission so come down at once!”
The stranger on the tree answered, “Why should I come down? This is the garden of God and I am
the servant of God, so I have the right to pick these fruits and you should not interfere between the
work of God and his servant.” The gardener was very surprised at this answer and thought of a
plan. He called his son and said, “go bring a rope and get this man down from the tree.” His son
brought the rope and the gardener ordered him to tie the stranger to the tree. The gardener then
took a stick and started to beat the stranger. The stranger began to scream. “Why are you beating
me? You have no right to do this.”
The gardener paid no attention and continued beating him. The stranger screamed, “Don't you
fear God, you are beating an innocent man? The gardener answered, “Why should I fear? This
wood in my hand belongs to God and I am too the servant of God, so I have nothing to fear, and
you shouldn't interfere with the work of God and his servant.” The stranger hesitated and then
spoke, “Wait don't beat me, I am sorry for taking the fruits. This is your garden and I should seek
your permission before taking the fruits. So, please forgive and set me free.”
The gardener smiled and said, “Since you have now realized your mistake, I will forgive you but
remember that God has given all his servants brains so every person's deeds are in his own hands.”
Then the gardener untied him and let him go free.
TO TELL THE TRUTH
“Who did this?” asked my teacher. Thirty children tried to think about
not only what they had done, but also what our teacher may have found
out. “Who did this?” asked my teacher once more. She wasn't really
asking, she was demanding an answer. She seldom became angry, but
she was this time. She held up a piece of broken glass and asked, “Who
broke this window?”
“Oh, oh,” I thought. I was the one who broke the window. I had not done it intentionally. It was
caused by an errant throw of a baseball. I was working on my knuckleball. It needed more work.
Why did it have to be me? It wasn't really my fault. If I admitted guilt, I would be in a lot of trouble.
How would I be able to pay for a big window like that? I didn't even get an allowance. “My father is
going to have a fit,” I thought. I didn't want to raise my hand, but some force much stronger than I
was pulled it skyward. I told the truth. “I did it.” I said no more. It was hard enough saying what I
had.

My teacher went to one of our library shelves
and took down a book. She then began walking
towards my desk. I had never seen my teacher
to strike a student, but I feared she was going to
start with me and she was going to use a book
for the swatting.
“I know how you like birds,” she said as she stood looking down at my guilt-ridden face. “Here is
that field guide about birds that you are constantly checking out. It is yours. It's time we got a new
one for the school anyway. The book is yours and you will not be punished as long as you
remember that I am not rewarding you for your misdeed, I am rewarding you for your
truthfulness.”
WHEN THE WINDS BLOW
Years ago a farmer owned land along the Atlantic seacoast. He constantly advertised for hired
hands. Most people were reluctant to work on farms along the Atlantic. They dreaded the awful
storms that raged across the ocean, wreaking havoc on the buildings and crops. As the farmer
interviewed applicants for the job, he received a steady stream of refusals.
Finally, a short, thin man, well past middle age, approached the farmer. “Are you a good
farmhand?” the farmer asked him. “Well, I can sleep when the wind blows,” answered the man.
Although puzzled by this answer, the farmer, desperate for help, hired him. The little man worked
well around the farm, busy from dawn to dusk, and the farmer felt satisfied with the man's work.
Then one night the wind howled loudly in from offshore. Jumping out of bed, the farmer grabbed
a lantern and rushed next door to the hired hand's sleeping quarters. He shook the little man and
yelled, “Get up! A storm is coming! Tie things down before they blow away!”
The little man rolled over in bed and said firmly,
“No sir. I told you, I can sleep when the wind blows.”
Enraged by the response, the farmer was tempted to fire
him on the spot. Instead, he hurried outside to prepare for
the storm. To his amazement, he discovered that all of the
haystacks had been covered with tarpaulins. The cows were
in the barn, the chickens were in the coops, and the doors
were barred. The shutters were tightly secured. Everything was tied down. Nothing could blow
away.
The farmer then understood what his hired hand meant, so he returned to his bed to also sleep
while the wind blew.
When you're prepared, spiritually, mentally, and physically, you have nothing to fear. Can you sleep
when the wind blows through your life? The hired hand in the story was able to sleep because he
had secured the farm against the storm.
We with faith secure ourselves against the storms of life by putting our trust in the
God, Our Prophet (SAW) and his Ahlul Byat (AS), We don't need to understand, and
we just need to hold His hand to be secure in the midst of the storms.
"Do not be like persons on whom advice has no
effect; they require punishments to improve them.
A sensible man acquires guidance through
advice, while brutes and beasts always improve
through punishments." Imam Ali (AS)

The night fell heavy in the heights of the mountains and the man could not see anything. All was
black. Zero visibility, and the moon and the stars were covered by the clouds. As he was climbing
only a few feet away from the top of the mountain, he slipped and fell in to the air, falling at great
speed. He could only see black spots as he went down, and the terrible sensation of being sucked by
gravity.
He kept falling, and in the moments of great fear, it came to his mind all the good and bad episodes
of his life. He was thinking now about how close death was getting, when all of a sudden he felt the
rope tied to his waist pull him very hard. His body was hanging in the air.
Only the rope was holding him and in that moment of stillness he had no other choice other to
scream: “Help me God.”
All of a sudden a deep voice coming from the sky answered, “What do you want me to do?”
“Save me God.”
“Do you really think I can save you?”
“Of course I believe You can.”
“Then cut the rope tied to your waist.”
There was a moment of silence and the man decided to hold on to the rope with all his strength.
The rescue team tells that the next day a climber was found dead and frozen, his body hanging
from a rope. His hands holding tight to it. Only one foot away from the ground.
And We? How attached we are to our rope will we let go??? Don't ever doubt about
the words of God. We should never say that He has forgotten us or abandoned us.
THE SHIP
A voyaging ship was wrecked during a storm at sea and only two of the men on it were able to swim
to a small, desert like island.
The two survivors, not knowing what else to do, agreed that they had no other recourse but to pray
to God. However, to find out whose prayer was more powerful, they agreed to divide the territory
between them and stay on opposite sides of the island.
The first thing they prayed for was food. The next morning, the first man saw a fruit-bearing tree
on his side of the land, and he was able to eat its fruit. The other man's parcel of land remained
barren.
After a week, the first man was lonely and he decided to pray for a wife. The next day, another ship
was wrecked, and the only survivor was a woman who swam to his side of the land. On the other
side of the island, there was nothing.
Soon the first man prayed for a house, clothes, more food. The next day, like magic, all of these
THE ROPE
100 Moral Stories 63 www.islamicoccasions.com
were given to him. However, the second man still had nothing.
Finally, the first man prayed for a ship, so that he and his wife
could leave the island. In the morning, he found a ship docked at
his side of the island. The first man boarded the ship with his wife
and decided to leave the second man on the island.
He considered the other man unworthy to receive God's blessings,
since none of his prayers had been answered.
As the ship was about to leave, the first man heard a voice from heaven booming, “Why are you
leaving your companion on the island?”
“My blessings are mine alone, since I was the one who prayed for them,” the first man answered.
“His prayers were all unanswered and so he does not deserve anything.”
“You are mistaken!” the voice rebuked him. “He had only one prayer, which I answered. If not for
that, you would not have received any of my blessings.”
“Tell me,” the first man asked the voice, “What did he pray for that I should owe him anything?”
“He prayed that all your prayers be answered.”
For all we know, our blessings are not the fruits of our prayers alone, but those of another praying for us.
THE CLEVER KING!
There was a country long time ago where the people would change a king every year. The person
who would become the king had to agree to a contract that he would be sent to an island after his
one year of being a king.
One king finished his term and it was time for him to go to the island and live there. The people
dressed him up in expensive clothes and put him on an elephant and took him around the cities to
say goodbye to all the people. This was the moment of sadness for all the kings who ruled for one
year. After saying farewell, the people took the king with a boat to remote island and left him there.
On their way back, they discovered a ship that had sunk just recently. They saw a young man who
survived by holding on to a floating piece of wood. As they needed a new king, they picked up the
young man and took him to their country. They requested him to be a king for a year. First he
refused but later he agreed to be a king. People told him about all the rules and regulations and
that how he will be sent to an island after one year.
After three days of being a king, he asked the ministers if they could show him the island where all
the other kings were sent. They agreed and took him to the island. The island was covered with
thick Jungles and sounds of vicious animals were heard coming out of them. The king went little bit
inside to check. Soon he discovered the dead bodies of all the past kings. He understood that as
soon as they were left in the island, the animals came and killed them.
The king went back to the country and collected 100 strong workers. He took them to the island
and instructed them to clean the Jungle, remove all the deadly animals & cut down all excess trees.
100 Moral Stories 64 www.islamicoccasions.com
He would visit the island every month to see how the work was progressing. In the first month, all
the animals were removed and many trees were cut down. In the second month, the whole island
was cleaned out. The king then told the workers to plant gardens in various parts of the island.
He also took with himself useful animals like chickens, ducks, birds, goats, cows etc. In the third
month, he ordered the workers to build big houses and docking stations for ships. Over the months,
the island turned into a beautiful place.
The young king would wear simple clothes and spend very little
from his earnings as a king. He sent all the earnings to the island
for storage. When nine months passed like this, the king called the
ministers and told them: “I know that I have to go the island after
one year, but I would like to go there right now.” But the ministers
didn't agree to this and said that he has to wait for another 3
months to complete the year.
3 months passed and now it was a full year. The people dressed up
the young king and put him on an elephant to take him around the
country to say goodbye to others. However, this king is
unusually happy to leave the kingdom.
People asked him, “All the other kings would cry at this moment and why are you laughing?”
He replied, “Don't you know what the wise people say? They say that when you came to this world
as a baby, you were crying and everyone was smiling. Live such a life that when you are die, you
will be smiling and everyone around you will be crying. I have lived that life. While all the other
kings were lost into the luxuries of the kingdom, I always thought about the future and planned for
it. I turned the deadly island into a beautiful abode for me where I can stay peacefully.”
The moral lesson from this story is about how we should live our life. The life of this world is to
prepare for the life hereafter. In this life, we shouldn't get lost into the deceiving and attractive
things of this world and forget about what is to come in the afterlife. Rather, even if we are kings,
we should live a simple life like our beloved Prophet Muhammad (SAW) and save all our
enjoyments for the hereafter. May Allah make it easy for us all. Amin.
Holy Quran (31:34) says: Verily the knowledge of the Hour is with Allah (alone). It is He Who
sends down rain, and He Who knows what is in the wombs. Nor does any one know what it is that
he will earn on the morrow: Nor does any one know in what land he is to die. Verily with Allah is
full knowledge and He is acquainted (with all things).
Holy Quran (59:18) urges us to prepare for tomorrow: O ye who believe! Fear Allah, and let every
soul look to what (provision) He has sent forth for the morrow. Yea, fear Allah: for Allah is
well-acquainted with (all) that ye do.
Some body asked Imam Hassan (AS),
Why are we reluctant to die, why don't we like death?
“Because,” replied the Imam Hassan (AS),
“You ruined your next world and developed this one; naturally,
you do not like to be transferred from flourishing to decline.”
THE ILLUSION OF REFLECTION
100 Moral Stories 65 www.islamicoccasions.com
Once there was a king who had presented his daughter, the princess, with a beautiful diamond
necklace. The necklace was stolen and his people in the kingdom searched everywhere but could
not find it. Some said a bird might have stolen it. The king then asked them all to search for it and
put a reward for $50,000 for anyone who found it.
One day a clerk was walking home along a river next to an industrial area. This river was
completely polluted, filthy and smelly. As he was walking, the clerk saw a shimmering in the river
and when he looked, he saw the diamond necklace. He decided to try and catch it so that he could
get the $50,000 reward. He put his hand in the filthy, dirty river and grabbed at the necklace, but
some how missed it and didn't catch it. He took his hand out and looked again and the necklace
was still there. He tried again, this time he walked in the river and dirtied his pants in the filthy
river and put his whole arm in to catch the necklace. But strangely, he still missed the necklace!
He came out and started walking away, feeling depressed.
Then again he saw the necklace, right there. This time he was determined to get it, no matter what.
He decided to plunge into the river, although it was a disgusting thing to do as the river was
polluted, and his whole body would become filthy. He plunged in, and searched everywhere for the
necklace and yet he failed. This time he was really bewildered and came out feeling very depressed
that he could not get the necklace that would get him $50,000.
Just then a saint who was walking by, saw him, and asked him what was the matter. The clerk
didn't want to share the secret with the saint, thinking the saint might take the necklace for himself,
so he refused to tell the saint anything. But the saint could see this man was troubled and being
compassionate, again asked the clerk to tell him the problem and promised that he would not tell
anyone about it. The clerk mustered some courage and decided to put some faith in the saint. He
told the saint about the necklace and how he tried and tried to catch it, but kept failing. The saint
then told him that perhaps he should try looking upward, toward the branches of the tree, instead
of in the filthy river. The clerk looked up and true enough, the necklace was dangling on the branch
of a tree. He had been trying to capture a mere reflection of the real necklace all this time.
Material happiness is just like the filthy, polluted river; because it is a mere reflection of the TRUE
happiness in the spiritual world.
We can never achieve the happiness we are looking for no matter how hard we endeavor in
material life. Instead we should look upwards, toward God, who is the source of real happiness, and
stop chasing after the reflection of this happiness in the material world. This spiritual happiness is
the only thing that can satisfy us completely.
“Happy is the man who always kept the
afterlife in his view, who remembers
the Day of Reckoning through his deeds,
who led a contented life and who was
happy with the lot that Allah hath
destined for him.” Imam Ali (AS)
An elderly carpenter was ready to retire. He told his employer-contractor of his plans to leave the
house-building business to live a more leisurely life with his wife and enjoy his extended family. He
would miss the paycheck each week, but he wanted to retire. They could get by.
The contractor was sorry to see his good worker go & asked if he could build just one more house as
a personal favor. The carpenter said yes, but over time it was easy to see that his heart was not in
his work. He resorted to shoddy workmanship and used inferior materials. It was an unfortunate
way to end a dedicated career.
When the carpenter finished his work, his employer came to inspect
the house. Then he handed the front-door key to the carpenter and
said, "This is your house... my gift to you."
The carpenter was shocked!
What a shame! If he had only known he was building his own house,
he would have done it all so differently.
So it is with us. We build our lives, a day at a time, often putting less than our best into the
building. Then, with a shock, we realize we have to live in the house we have built.
If we could do it over, we would do it much differently.
But, you cannot go back. You are the carpenter, and every day you hammer a nail, place a board, or
erect a wall. Someone once said, “Life is a do-it-yourself project.” Your attitude, and the choices you
make today, helps build the “house” you will live in tomorrow. Therefore, build wisely!
SAND AND STONE
A story tells that two friends were walking through the desert. During some point of the journey
they had an argument, and one friend slapped the other one in the face. The one who got slapped
was hurt, but without saying anything, wrote in the sand: “TODAY MY BEST FRIEND SLAPPED
ME IN THE FACE.”
They kept on walking until they found an oasis, where they decided to
take a bath. The one, who had been slapped, got stuck in the mire and
started drowning, but the friend saved him. After the friend recovered
from the near drowning, he wrote on a stone: “TODAY MY BEST
FRIEND SAVED MY LIFE.”
The friend who had slapped and saved his best friend asked him, “After
I hurt you, you wrote in the sand and now, you write on a stone, why?”
The other friend replied: “When someone hurts us, we should write it down in sand where winds of
forgiveness can erase it away. But, when someone does something good for us, we must engrave it
in stone where no wind can ever erase it.”
Learn to write your hurts in the sand, and to carve your benefits in stone.

There was no timetable nor a room designated for PRAYERS in the
School. The School was ‘secular,' hence prayers were not supposed to
be allowed.
After being interviewed and accepted by the school administration,
the eager teaching prospect said in protest: “Let me see if I've got this
right.” You want me to go into that room with all those kids and fill
their every waking moment with a love for learning. And I'm
supposed to instill a sense of pride in their ethnicity, modify their
disruptive behavior, observe them for signs of abuse and even censor
their T-shirt messages and dress habits.
You want me to wage a war on drugs and sexually transmitted diseases, check their backpacks for
weapons of mass destruction, and raise their self-esteem.
You want me to teach them firm belief in God, patriotism, good citizenship, sportsmanship, and
fair play, how and where to register to vote, how to balance a checkbook, & how to apply for a job.
I am to check their heads for lice, maintain a safe environment, recognize signs of antisocial
behavior, offer advice, write letters of recommendation for student employment and scholarships,
and encourage respect for their elders and future employers.
And I am to communicate regularly with the parents by letter, telephone, newsletter, & report card.
All of this I am to do with just a piece of chalk, a blackboard, a few books, a bulletin board, and a
big smile AND on a starting salary that qualifies my family for food stamps!
You want me to do all of this, and you expect me NOT TO PRAY.
You expect me not to pray when Holy Quran (Baqarah 2:45) says: “Nay, seek (Allah's) help with
patient perseverance and PRAYER: It is indeed hard, except to those who bring a lowly spirit.”
“O my Lord! Make me and my children among those who establish prayers.” (Ibrahim: 40)
“Indeed it is the Prayers, which helps to refrain from indecent acts and evils.” (Ankabut: 45)
You want me to do all of this and you expect me not to pray when SUCCESS of every one depends
on Prayers. Holy Quran (Al-Mu'minuun: 9) says that successful believers are: “...... those who are
punctual in their prayers.”
Dear sir, since I am sure that I will not be able to fulfill your expectations, nor I will be successful in
my career WITHOUT prayers, “I resign willingly from the post.”
The Administrator looked down for a while then suddenly declared: “Young man, go ahead with
your job. You have taught me a very important lesson today: Without prayers and help from God,
no work is a success. We shall make special arrangements for prayers from today.”
A TEACHER'S PROTEST!

There was a man in Isfahan who used to beat his wife but unfortunately she
succumbed to his beating though he had not intended to kill her. But when she
was dead he became fearful of her relatives. In a state of anxiety he came out of
his house and met an acquaintance to whom he posed his problem.
The friend told him to invite a young man to his house and behead him and put
the severed head next to the wife's corpse. Then he would tell the wife's relatives
that he had found them together in bed and was unable to control his ire. And
slew them both. The man liked the idea and sat at the doorway in anticipation of
a young man. After sometime a handsome youth passed by his house. He invited him inside and
beheaded him.
Then he summoned the wife's relatives and told them the fictitious story. They were satisfied but
the person who had devised this plan had a teenage son who did not reach home that day. The man
was worried and when the son failed to turn up he came to the house of the one whom he had
offered evil advice and asked him if he carried out the plan suggested by him. Yes, said he and took
him near the dead bodies. He was shocked when he saw that the youth he had killed was his own
son. His evil advice caused the death of his own son.
The moral of this story is that one who digs a pit for others falls into it himself.
History is replete with such incidents.
According to Tafserul Mizan the following saying was common among the Arabs: One who digs a
hole for his brother; Allah throws him headlong into it. A similar proverb is present in Persian also:
Do not do evil to anyone the sane evil will turn towards you.

PUPPIES FOR SALE
A farmer had some puppies he needed to sell. He painted a sign advertising the pups and set about
nailing it to a post on the edge of his yard. As he was driving the last nail into the post, he felt a tug
on his overalls. He looked down into the Eyes of a little boy.
“Mister,” he said, “I want to buy one of your puppies.”
“Well,” said the farmer, as he rubbed the sweat off the back of his neck, “these puppies come from
fine parents and cost a good deal of money.”
The boy dropped his head for a moment. Then reaching deep into his pocket, he pulled out a
handful of change and held it up to the farmer. “I've got thirty-nine cents. Is that enough to take a
look?” “Sure,” said the farmer.
And with that he let out a whistle, “Here Dolly!” he called.
Out from the doghouse and down the ramp ran Dolly followed by four little balls of fur.
The little boy pressed his face against the chain link fence. His eyes danced with delight.
DO NOT DO EVIL TO ANYONE

As the dogs made their way to the fence, the little boy noticed something else stirring inside the
doghouse. Slowly another little ball appeared; this One noticeably smaller. Down the ramp it slid.
Then in a somewhat awkward manner the little pup began hobbling toward the others, doing its
best to catch up....
“I want that one,” the little boy said, pointing to the runt.
The farmer knelt down at the boy's side and said, “Son, you don't want that
puppy. He will never be able to run and play with you like these other dogs
would.”
With that the little boy stepped back from the fence, reached down, and
began rolling up one leg of his trousers. In doing so he revealed a steel
brace running down both sides of his leg attaching itself to a specially made
shoe. Looking back up at the farmer, he said, “You see sir, I don't run too well myself, and he will
need someone who understands.”
The world is full of people who need someone who understands.
OFFFICE BOY
A jobless man applied for the position of “office boy” at a very big firm.
The HR manager interviewed him, then a test: clean the floor. “You are hired” he said, give me
your email address, and I'll send you the application to fill, as well as when you will start.
The man replied “I don't have a computer, neither an email.”
I'm sorry, said the HR manager, if you don't have an email that means you do not exist. And who
doesn't exist, cannot have the job. The man left with no hope at all. He didn't know what to do,
with only $10 US in his pocket.
He then decided to go to the supermarket and buy a 10 KG tomato crate. He then sold the tomatoes
in a door to door round. In less than two hours, he succeeded to double his capital. He repeated the
operation 3 times, and returned home with $60 US. The man realized that he can survive by this
way, and started to go everyday earlier, and return late. Thus, his money doubles or triples every
day. Shortly later, he bought a cart, then a truck, and then he had his own fleet of delivery vehicles.
5 years later, the man is one of the biggest food retailers in the US. He started to plan his family's
future, and decided to have a life insurance.
He called an insurance broker, and chooses a protection plan. When the conversation was
concluded, the broker asked him his email. The man replied: “I don't have an email.” The broker
replied curiously, you don't have an email, and yet have succeeded to build an
empire. Do you imagine what you could have been if you had an email?
The man thought for a while, and replied: an office boy!
The moral of this story:
1: Internet is not the solution to your life.
2: If you don't have internet and you work hard you can be a millionaire.
3: If you received this message by email, you are closer to be an office boy, rather than a
MILLIONAIRE.

As the dream of most parents I had acquired a MBBS degree and passed PLAB to enter UK, the
land of braves and opportunity. When I arrived in the UK, it was as if a dream had come true. Here
at last I was in the place where I wanted to be. I decided I would be staying in this country for
about Five years (maximum Permit Free Period) in which time I would have earned enough money
to settle down in India.
My father was a government employee and after his retirement, the only asset he could acquire was
a decent one bedroom flat. I wanted to do some thing more than him. I started feeling homesick
and lonely as the time passed. I used to call home and speak to my parents every week using cheap
international phone cards.
Two years passed, two years of Burgers at McDonald's and chicken legs in KFC and discos and 2
years watching the foreign exchange rate getting happy whenever the Rupee value went down.
Finally I decided to get married. Told my parents that I have only 10 days of holidays and
everything must be done within these 10 days. I got my ticket booked in the cheapest flight. Was
jubilant as I was actually enjoying shopping for gifts for all my relatives and friends back home.
If I miss anyone then there will be talks. After reaching home I spent home one week going through
all the photographs of girls and as the time was getting shorter I was forced to select one candidate.
In-laws told me, to my surprise, that I would have to get married in 2-3 days, as I will not get
anymore holidays soon and they cannot wait for long.
After the marriage, it was time to return to UK, after giving some money to my parents and telling
the neighbors to look after them, we (I was lucky and managed to get the visa of my wife early)
returned to UK.
My wife enjoyed this country for about two months and then she started feeling lonely. The
frequency of calling India increased to twice in a week sometimes 3 times a week as she also has to
call her parents. Our savings started diminishing. After two more years we started to have kids.
Two lovely kids, a boy and a girl, were gifted to us by the almighty. Every time I spoke to my
parents, they asked me to come to India so that they can see their grand-children. Every year I
decide to go to India.
But part work, part monetary conditions prevented it. Years went by and visiting India was a
distant dream. Then suddenly one day I got a message that my parents were seriously sick. I tried
but I couldn't get any holidays and was stuck up in the procedures and thus could not go to India.
The next message I got was my parents were passed away and as there was no one to do the last
rites the society members had done whatever they could. I was depressed. My parents passed away
without seeing their grand children.
After couple more years passed away, much to my children's dislike (by now nearly cocos) and my
wife's joy we returned to India to settle down. I started to look for a suitable property, but to my
dismay my savings were short and the property prices had gone up during all these years. I had to
return to the UK. My wife refused to come back with me and my children refused to stay in India.
My 2 children and I returned to UK after promising my wife I would be back for good after two
years.
ONE BEDROOM FLAT
100 Moral Stories 70 www.islamicoccasions.com
Time passed by, my daughter decided to get married to a Scottish and my son was happy living in
Ireland. I decided that enough is enough and wound-up every thing and returned to India. I had
just enough money to buy a decent Two-bed room flat in a well-developed locality. Now I am 60
years old and the only time I go out of the flat is for the routine visit to the nearby place of worship.
My faithful wife has also left me and gone to the holy abode.
Sometimes I wondered was it worth all this? My father, even after staying in India, had a house to
his name and I too have the same, nothing more.
I lost my parents and children for just ONE EXTRA BEDROOM. Looking out from the window I
see a lot of children dancing. This damned cable TV has spoiled our new generation and these
children are losing their values and culture because of it. I get occasional cards from my children
asking I am alright.
Well at least they remember me. Now perhaps after I die it will be
the neighbors again who will be performing my last rites,
God Bless them.
But the question still remains ‘was all this worth it?'
I am still searching for an answer....There are no unanswered
prayers.... At times the answer is NO.
THEY ARE NOT IN NEED OF YOUR PRESENTS...!
A'bdullah Ibn Masud had been one of the close companions of the Holy Prophet (SAW) and had
developed into being a distinguished and zealous personality of Islam. During the caliphate of
Hazrat U'thman, he suffered a bout of illness, which eventually resulted in his death.
Hazrat U'thman once came to pay him a visit and finding him distressed, asked, what distresses
you so greatly? My sins, he answered.
Tell me your wish so that I can fulfill it for you.
I desire God mercy, replied Ibn Masud.
The caliph asked, if you permit, I could call for the doctor.
It is the Doctor who has made me sick, replied Ibn Masud.
If you want, I could present you with gifts from the Public Treasury.
Ibn Masud retorted, at the time when I was in need, you did not give me a thing and now that I am
not in need, you wish to shower me with presents!
Hazrat U'thman insisted, Let these gifts be for your daughters then.
They are not in need of your presents, Ibn Masud replied tersely. I have instructed them to recite
the chapter Al-Waaqiah every night, for surely, I have heard the Holy Prophet (SAW) say: One, who
recites the chapter Al-Waaqiah every night, shall never be afflicted by poverty.

“The honor of a Mu'min lies in night worship
and his esteem lies in his being
independent of the people.”
Imam Sadiq (AS)
“Prayer reverts both what has been destined and what has not been destined.” Imam Musa (AS)
It's a phrase that my mother uses a lot. I used to wonder, “How in the world
can Mother call them beautiful?” I am a logical, statistical man. I call things
as I see them. I didn't see beauty.
My mother would tell people this with an enthusiasm they could feel. She
was genuine. She wasn't telling them they were beautiful to get something
from them. Most of the time, they were trying to get something from her.
I wondered for years what was wrong with Mother's perception and vision.
Couldn't she see that all of the people she called beautiful weren't beautiful?
You were beautiful only if you had a certain figure and face that was classed as beautiful by the laws
of the world and glamour. Yet when my mother spoke, people smiled as though Glamour magazine
had listed them as one of the beautiful people of the year.
It took me years to finally understand my mother's vision and the phrase, “Beauty is in the eye of
the beholder.” My mother had a spirit that could see the beauty in a person. Most only look on the
outside and then compare what they see with the standards the world has given them. That was
what I was doing. Today when you leave your house, carefully look at the first person whom you
see and notice how beautiful they are.
They may be balding, fat, wrinkled, pimply, or any of the other things the world frowns upon as
beauty. Look at them closely and look for the beauty. If you really look, you'll see it.
I didn't believe that at first until I tried it. Sure enough, as I stared and opened another set of eyes,
I was able to see the beauty in every person. No matter how rough or worn a person looked, each
pain etched line held a glimpse of beauty.
You just had to look for the beauty. It's there. When you leave your home this morning, look hard
at each person. You will start to see the beauty of every human who you didn't know existed. Trust
me and try this. If you sincerely look, you will see it. When you get home after seeing the beauty in
faces you see, look in the mirror. You are beautiful. Thank you mama for all of the beauty that you
have not only seen, but added. She used to tell me: “Be like a honey bee which always sits on
beautiful flowers.”
Prophet Muhammad (SAW) said: “Indeed Allah is Beautiful and He loves beauty.” In other place
he (SAW) says: “A believer is beautiful because Allah has given him beautiful characters.”
Holy Quran emphasizes on remembering the beautiful things Allah (SWT) has created and praise
them profusely. “And as for the blessing of your Lord, do announce it.” (93:11)
Allah (SWT) Himself remembers and praises the good creations He has created; among them is His
beloved Prophet Muhammad (SAW): “And He exalted your praise (O Muhammad).” (94:4)
“Indeed Allah and His Angels are sending blessings upon the Prophet. O you who believe, send
blessings upon him (you as well) and salute him with a (becoming) salutation.” (33:56)
Dear readers, you are beautiful. May Allah's beautiful blessings be upon you always.
YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL!

A man came out of his home to admire his new truck.
To his puzzlement, his three-year-old son was happily hammering
dents into the shiny paint of the truck.
The man ran to his son, knocked him away, and hammered the little
boy's hands into pulp as punishment.
When the father calmed down, he rushed his son to the hospital. Although the doctor tried
desperately to save the crushed bones, he finally had to amputate fingers from boy's both hands.
When the boy woke up from the surgery and saw his bandaged stubs, he innocently said, “Daddy,
I'm sorry about your truck.” Then he asked, “But when are my fingers going to grow back?”
The father went home and committed suicide.
Think about this story the next time someone
steps on your feet or you wish to take revenge.
Think first before you lose your patience with someone u love. Trucks can be repaired. Broken
bones and hurt feelings often can't.
Too often we fail to recognize the difference between the person and the performance. We forget
that forgiveness is greater than revenge.
People make mistakes. We are allowed to make mistakes. But the actions we take while in a rage
will haunt us forever. Pause and ponder. Think before you act. Be patient. Forgive and forget.
Love one and all.
THE FATHER AND HIS SONS
A father had a family of sons who were perpetually quarreling among
themselves. When he failed to heal their disputes by his exhortations, he
determined to give them a practical illustration of the evils of disunion; and for
this purpose he one day told them to bring him a bundle of sticks.
When they had done so, he placed the faggot into
the hands of each of them in succession, and
ordered them to break it in pieces. They tried with
all their strength, and were not able to do it. He
next opened the faggot, took the sticks separately, one by one, and
again put them into his sons' hands, upon which they broke them
easily.
He then addressed them in these words: “My sons, if you are of one mind, and unite to assist each
other, you will be as this faggot, uninjured by all the attempts of your enemies; but if you are
divided among yourselves, you will be broken as easily as these sticks.”
In Union there is strength. Divided we fall; United we stand.
BE PATIENT
100 Moral Stories 73 www.islamicoccasions.com
“One who cannot benefit by patience will die
of grief and excitement.” Imam Ali (AS)
Next autumn, when you see geese heading south for the winter, flying in a “V” formation, you
might consider what science has discovered as to why they fly that way. As each bird flaps its wings,
it creates uplift for the bird immediately following. By flying in a “V” formation, the whole flock
adds at least 71 percent greater flying range than if each bird flew on its own.
People who share a common direction and sense of community can get
where they are going more quickly and easily, because they are traveling
on the thrust of one another.
When a goose falls out of formation, it suddenly feels the drag and
resistance of trying to go it alone and quickly gets back into formation to
take advantage of the lifting power of the bird in front. If we have the
sense of a goose, we will stay in formation with those people who are heading the same way we are.
When the head goose gets tired, it rotates back in the wing and another goose flies point.
It is sensible to take turns doing demanding jobs, whether with people or with geese flying south.
Geese honk from behind to encourage those up front to keep up their speed.
What message do we give when we honk from behind?
Finally - and this is important - when a goose gets sick or is wounded by gunshot, and falls out of
the formation, two other geese fall out with that goose and follow it down to lend help and
protection. They stay with the fallen goose until it is able to fly or until it dies; and only then do
they launch out on their own, or with another formation to catch up with their own group.
If we have the sense of a goose, we will stand by each other like that.
MAKING A DIFFERENCE
My friend was walking down a deserted Mexican beach at sunset. As he walked along, he began to
see another man in the distance. As he grew nearer, he noticed that the local native kept leaning
down, picking something up and throwing it out into the water. Time and again he kept hurling
things out into the ocean. As my friend approached even closer, he noticed that the man was
picking up starfish that had washed up on the beach, and, one at a time, he was throwing them
back into the water. My friend was puzzled.
He approached the man and said. “Good evening, friend. I was wondering what
you are doing.”
“I'm throwing these starfish back into the ocean. You see its low tide right now
and all of these starfish have been washed up onto the shore. If I don't throw
them back into the sea, they'll die up here from lack of oxygen.”
“I understand,” my friend replied, “but there must be thousands of starfish on this beach. You can't
possibly get to all of them. There are simply too many. And don't you realize this is probably
happening on hundreds of beaches all up and down this coast. Can't you see that you can't possibly
make a difference?”

«Be careful what you wish for, you may receive it.» –Anonymous

Part I
Without, the night was cold and wet, but in the small parlour of Laburnum villa the blinds were drawn and the fire burned brightly. Father and son were at chess; the former, who possessed ideas about the game involving radical chances, putting his king into such sharp and unnecessary perils that it even provoked comment from the white-haired old lady knitting placidly by the fire.

«Hark at the wind,» said Mr. White, who, having seen a fatal mistake after it was too late, was amiably desirous of preventing his son from seeing it.

«I'm listening,» said the latter grimly surveying the board as he stretched out his hand. «Check.»

«I should hardly think that he's come tonight, » said his father, with his hand poised over the board.

«Mate,» replied the son.

«That's the worst of living so far out,» balled Mr. White with sudden and unlooked-for violence; «Of all the beastly, slushy, out of the way places to live in, this is the worst. Path's a bog, and the road's a torrent. I don't know what people are thinking about. I suppose because only two houses in the road are let, they think it doesn't matter.»

«Never mind, dear,» said his wife soothingly; «perhaps you'll win the next one.»

Mr. White looked up sharply, just in time to intercept a knowing glance between mother and son. the words died away on his lips, and he hid a guilty grin in his thin grey beard.

«There he is,» said Herbert White as the gate banged to loudly and heavy footsteps came toward the door.

The old man rose with hospitable haste and opening the door, was heard condoling with the new arrival. The new arrival also condoled with himself, so that Mrs. White said, «Tut, tut!» and coughed gently as her husband entered the room followed by a tall, burly man, beady of eye and rubicund of visage.

«Sergeant-Major Morris, » he said, introducing him.

The Sergeant-Major took hands and taking the proffered seat by the fire, watched contentedly as his host got out whiskey and tumblers and stood a small copper kettle on the fire.

At the third glass his eyes got brighter, and he began to talk, the little family circle regarding with eager interest this visitor from distant parts, as he squared his broad shoulders in the chair and spoke of wild scenes and doughty deeds; of wars and plagues and strange peoples.

«Twenty-one years of it,» said Mr. White, nodding at his wife and son. «When he went away he was a slip of a youth in the warehouse. Now look at him.»

«He don't look to have taken much harm.» said Mrs. White politely.

«I'd like to go to India myself,» said the old man, just to look around a bit, you know.»

«Better where you are,» said the Sergeant-Major, shaking his head. He put down the empty glass and sighning softly, shook it again.

«I should like to see those old temples and fakirs and jugglers,» said the old man. «what was that that you started telling me the other day about a monkey's paw or something, Morris?»

«Nothing.» said the soldier hastily. «Leastways, nothing worth hearing.»

«Monkey's paw?» said Mrs. White curiously.

«Well, it's just a bit of what you might call magic, perhaps.» said the Sergeant-Major off-handedly.

His three listeners leaned forward eagerly. The visitor absent-mindedly put his empty glass to his lips and then set it down again. His host filled it for him again.

«To look at,» said the Sergeant-Major, fumbling in his pocket, «it's just an ordinary little paw, dried to a mummy.»

He took something out of his pocket and proffered it. Mrs. White drew back with a grimace, but her son, taking it, examined it curiously.

«And what is there special about it?» inquired Mr. White as he took it from his son, and having examined it, placed it upon the table.

«It had a spell put on it by an old Fakir,» said the Sergeant-Major, «a very holy man. He wanted to show that fate ruled people's lives, and that those who interfered with it did so to their sorrow. He put a spell on it so that three separate men could each have three wishes from it.»

His manners were so impressive that his hearers were conscious that their light laughter had jarred somewhat.

«Well, why don't you have three, sir?» said Herbert White cleverly.

The soldier regarded him the way that middle age is wont to regard presumptuous youth.»I have,» he said quietly, and his blotchy face whitened.

«And did you really have the three wishes granted?» asked Mrs. White.

«I did,» said the sergeant-major, and his glass tapped against his strong teeth.

«And has anybody else wished?» persisted the old lady.

«The first man had his three wishes. Yes,» was the reply, «I don't know what the first two were, but the third was for death. That's how I got the paw.»

His tones were so grave that a hush fell upon the group.

«If you've had your three wishes it's no good to you now then Morris,» said the old man at last. «What do you keep it for?»

The soldier shook his head. «Fancy I suppose,» he said slowly.» I did have some idea of selling it, but I don't think I will. It has caused me enough mischief already. Besides, people won't buy. They think it's a fairy tale, some of them; and those who do think anything of it want to try it first and pay me afterward.»

«If you could have another three wishes,» said the old man, eyeing him keenly,» would you have them?»

«I don't know,» said the other. «I don't know.»

He took the paw, and dangling it between his forefinger and thumb, suddenly threw it upon the fire. White, with a slight cry, stooped down and snatched it off.

«Better let it burn,» said the soldier solemnly.

«If you don't want it Morris,» said the other, «give it to me.»

«I won't.» said his friend doggedly. «I threw it on the fire. If you keep it, don't blame me for what happens. Pitch it on the fire like a sensible man.»

The other shook his head and examined his possession closely. «How do you do it?» he inquired.

«Hold it up in your right hand, and wish aloud,» said the Sergeant-Major, «But I warn you of the consequences.»

«Sounds like the ‘Arabian Nights'», said Mrs. White, as she rose and began to set the supper. «Don't you think you might wish for four pairs of hands for me.»

Her husband drew the talisman from his pocket, and all three burst into laughter as the Seargent-Major, with a look of alarm on his face, caught him by the arm.

«If you must wish,» he said gruffly, «Wish for something sensible.»

Mr. White dropped it back in his pocket, and placing chairs, motioned his friend to the table. In the business of supper the talisman was partly forgotten, and afterward the three sat listening in an enthralled fashion to a second installment of the soldier's adventures in India.

«If the tale about the monkey's paw is not more truthful than those he has been telling us,» said Herbert, as the door closed behind their guest, just in time to catch the last train, «we shan't make much out of it.»

«Did you give anything for it, father?» inquired Mrs. White, regarding her husband closely.

«A trifle,» said he, colouring slightly, «He didn't want it, but I made him take it. And he pressed me again to throw it away.»

«Likely,» said Herbert, with pretended horror. «Why, we're going to be rich, and famous, and happy. Wish to be an emperor, father, to begin with; then you can't be henpecked.»

He darted around the table, pursued by the maligned Mrs White armed with an antimacassar.

Mr. White took the paw from his pocket and eyed it dubiously. «I don't know what to wish for, and that's a fact,» he said slowly. It seems to me I've got all I want.»

«If you only cleared the house, you'd be quite happy, wouldn't you!» said Herbert, with his hand on his shoulder. «Well, wish for two hundred pounds, then; that'll just do it.»

His father, smiling shamefacedly at his own credulity, held up the talisman, as his son, with a solemn face, somewhat marred by a wink at his mother, sat down and struck a few impressive chords.

«I wish for two hundred pounds,» said the old man distinctly.

A fine crash from the piano greeted his words, interrupted by a shuddering cry from the old man. His wife and son ran toward him.

«It moved,» he cried, with a glance of disgust at the object as it lay on the floor. «As I wished, it twisted in my hand like a snake.»

«Well, I don't see the money,» said his son, as he picked it up and placed it on the table, «and I bet I never shall.»

«It must have been your fancy, father,» said his wife, regarding him anxiously.

He shook his head. «Never mind, though; there's no harm done, but it gave me a shock all the same.»

They sat down by the fire again while the two men finished their pipes. Outside, the wind was higher than ever, an the old man started nervously at the sound of a door banging upstairs. A silence unusual and depressing settled on all three, which lasted until the old couple rose to retire for the rest of the night.

«I expect you'll find the cash tied up in a big bag in the middle of your bed,» said Herbert, as he bade them good night, » and something horrible squatting on top of your wardrobe watching you as you pocket your ill-gotten gains.»

He sat alone in the darkness, gazing at the dying fire, and seeing faces in it. The last was so horrible and so simian that he gazed at it in amazement. It got so vivid that, with a little uneasy laugh, he felt on the table for a glass containing a little water to throw over it. His hand grasped the monkey's paw, and with a little shiver he wiped his hand on his coat and went up to bed.

Part II
In the brightness of the wintry sun next morning as it streamed over the breakfast table he laughed at his fears. There was an air of prosaic wholesomeness about the room which it had lacked on the previous night, and the dirty, shriveled little paw was pitched on the side-board with a carelessness which betokened no great belief in its virtues.

«I suppose all old soldiers are the same,» said Mrs White. «The idea of our listening to such nonsense! How could wishes be granted in these days? And if they could, how could two hundred pounds hurt you, father?»

«Might drop on his head from the sky,» said the frivolous Herbert.

«Morris said the things happened so naturally,» said his father, «that you might if you so wished attribute it to coincidence.»

«Well don't break into the money before I come back,» said Herbert as he rose from the table. «I'm afraid it'll turn you into a mean, avaricious man, and we shall have to disown you.»

His mother laughed, and following him to the door, watched him down the road; and returning to the breakfast table, was very happy at the expense of her husband's credulity. All of which did not prevent her from scurrying to the door at the postman's knock, nor prevent her from referring somewhat shortly to retired Sergeant-Majors of bibulous habits when she found that the post brought a tailor's bill.

«Herbert will have some more of his funny remarks, I expect, when he comes home,» she said as they sat at dinner.

«I dare say,» said Mr. White, pouring himself out some beer; «but for all that, the thing moved in my hand; that I'll swear to.»

«You thought it did,» said the old lady soothingly.

«I say it did,» replied the other. «There was no thought about it; I had just — What's the matter?»

His wife made no reply. She was watching the mysterious movements of a man outside, who, peering in an undecided fashion at the house, appeared to be trying to make up his mind to enter. In mental connexion with the two hundred pounds, she noticed that the stranger was well dressed, and wore a silk hat of glossy newness. Three times he paused at the gate, and then walked on again. The fourth time he stood with his hand upon it, and then with sudden resolution flung it open and walked up the path. Mrs White at the same moment placed her hands behind her, and hurriedly unfastening the strings of her apron, put that useful article of apparel beneath the cushion of her chair.

She brought the stranger, who seemed ill at ease, into the room. He gazed at her furtively, and listened in a preoccupied fashion as the old lady apologized for the appearance of the room, and her husband's coat, a garment which he usually reserved for the garden. She then waited as patiently as her sex would permit for him to broach his business, but he was at first strangely silent.

«I — was asked to call,» he said at last, and stooped and picked a piece of cotton from his trousers. «I come from ‘Maw and Meggins.' «

The old lady started. «Is anything the matter?» she asked breathlessly. «Has anything happened to Herbert? What is it? What is it?

Her husband interposed. «There there mother,» he said hastily. «Sit down, and don't jump to conclusions. You've not brought bad news, I'm sure sir,» and eyed the other wistfully.

«I'm sorry — » began the visitor.

«Is he hurt?» demanded the mother wildly.

The visitor bowed in assent.»Badly hurt,» he said quietly, «but he is not in any pain.»

«Oh thank God!» said the old woman, clasping her hands. «Thank God for that! Thank — «

She broke off as the sinister meaning of the assurance dawned on her and she saw the awful confirmation of her fears in the others averted face. She caught her breath, and turning to her slower-witted husband, laid her trembling hand on his. There was a long silence.

«He was caught in the machinery,» said the visitor at length in a low voice.

«Caught in the machinery,» repeated Mr. White, in a dazed fashion,»yes.»

He sat staring out the window, and taking his wife's hand between his own, pressed it as he had been wont to do in their old courting days nearly forty years before.

«He was the only one left to us,» he said, turning gently to the visitor. «It is hard.»

The other coughed, and rising, walked slowly to the window. » The firm wishes me to convey their sincere sympathy with you in your great loss,» he said, without looking round. «I beg that you will understand I am only their servant and merely obeying orders.»

There was no reply; the old woman's face was white, her eyes staring, and her breath inaudible; on the husband's face was a look such as his friend the sergeant might have carried into his first action.

«I was to say that Maw and Meggins disclaim all responsibility,» continued the other. «They admit no liability at all, but in consideration of your son's services, they wish to present you with a certain sum as compensation.»

Mr. White dropped his wife's hand, and rising to his feet, gazed with a look of horror at his visitor. His dry lips shaped the words, «How much?»

«Two hundred pounds,» was the answer.

Unconscious of his wife's shriek, the old man smiled faintly, put out his hands like a sightless man, and dropped, a senseless heap, to the floor.

Part III
In the huge new cemetery, some two miles distant, the old people buried their dead, and came back to the house steeped in shadows and silence. It was all over so quickly that at first they could hardly realize it, and remained in a state of expectation as though of something else to happen — something else which was to lighten this load, too heavy for old hearts to bear.

But the days passed, and expectations gave way to resignation — the hopeless resignation of the old, sometimes mis-called apathy. Sometimes they hardly exchanged a word, for now they had nothing to talk about, and their days were long to weariness.

It was about a week after that the old man, waking suddenly in the night, stretched out his hand and found himself alone. The room was in darkness, and the sound of subdued weeping came from the window. He raised himself in bed and listened.

«Come back,» he said tenderly. «You will be cold.»

«It is colder for my son,» said the old woman, and wept afresh.

The sounds of her sobs died away on his ears. The bed was warm, and his eyes heavy with sleep. He dozed fitfully, and then slept until a sudden wild cry from his wife awoke him with a start.

«THE PAW!» she cried wildly. «THE MONKEY'S PAW!»

He started up in alarm. «Where? Where is it? What's the matter?»

She came stumbling across the room toward him. «I want it,» she said quietly. «You've not destroyed it?»

«It's in the parlour, on the bracket,» he replied, marveling. «Why?»

She cried and laughed together, and bending over, kissed his cheek.

«I only just thought of it,» she said hysterically. «Why didn't I think of it before? Why didn't you think of it?»

«Think of what?» he questioned.

«The other two wishes,» she replied rapidly. «We've only had one.»

«Was not that enough?» he demanded fiercely.

«No,» she cried triumphantly; «We'll have one more. Go down and get it quickly, and wish our boy alive again.»

The man sat in bed and flung the bedclothes from his quaking limbs.»Good God, you are mad!» he cried aghast. «Get it,» she panted; «get it quickly, and wish — Oh my boy, my boy!»

Her husband struck a match and lit the candle. «Get back to bed he said unsteadily. «You don't know what you are saying.»

«We had the first wish granted,» said the old woman, feverishly; «why not the second?»

«A coincidence,» stammered the old man.

«Go get it and wish,» cried his wife, quivering with excitement.

The old man turned and regarded her, and his voice shook. «He has been dead ten days, and besides he — I would not tell you else, but — I could only recognize him by his clothing. If he was too terrible for you to see then, how now?»

«Bring him back,» cried the old woman, and dragged him towards the door. «Do you think I fear the child I have nursed?»

He went down in the darkness, and felt his way to the parlour, and then to the mantlepiece. The talisman was in its place, and a horrible fear that the unspoken wish might bring his mutilated son before him ere he could escape from the room seized up on him, and he caught his breath as he found that he had lost the direction of the door. His brow cold with sweat, he felt his way round the table, and groped along the wall until he found himself in the small passage with the unwholesome thing in his hand.

Even his wife's face seemed changed as he entered the room. It was white and expectant, and to his fears seemed to have an unnatural look upon it. He was afraid of her.

«WISH!» she cried in a strong voice.

«It is foolish and wicked,» he faltered.

«WISH!» repeated his wife.

He raised his hand. «I wish my son alive again.»

The talisman fell to the floor, and he regarded it fearfully. Then he sank trembling into a chair as the old woman, with burning eyes, walked to the window and raised the blind.

He sat until he was chilled with the cold, glancing occasionally at the figure of the old woman peering through the window. The candle-end, which had burned below the rim of the china candlestick, was throwing pulsating shadows on the ceiling and walls, until with a flicker larger than the rest, it expired. The old man, with an unspeakable sense of relief at the failure of the talisman, crept back back to his bed, and a minute afterward the old woman came silently and apathetically beside him.

Neither spoke, but sat silently listening to the ticking of the clock. A stair creaked, and a squeaky mouse scurried noisily through the wall. The darkness was oppressive, and after lying for some time screwing up his courage, he took the box of matches, and striking one, went downstairs for a candle.

At the foot of the stairs the match went out, and he paused to strike another; and at the same moment a knock came so quiet and stealthy as to be scarcely audible, sounded on the front door.

The matches fell from his hand and spilled in the passage. He stood motionless, his breath suspended until the knock was repeated. Then he turned and fled swiftly back to his room, and closed the door behind him. A third knock sounded through the house.

«WHAT'S THAT?» cried the old woman, starting up.

«A rat,» said the old man in shaking tones — «a rat. It passed me on the stairs.»

His wife sat up in bed listening. A loud knock resounded through the house.

«It's Herbert!»

She ran to the door, but her husband was before her, and catching her by the arm, held her tightly.

«What are you going to do?» he whispered hoarsely.

«It's my boy; it's Herbert!» she cried, struggling mechanically. «I forgot it was two miles away. What are you holding me for? Let go. I must open the door.»

«For God's sake don't let it in,» cried the old man, trembling.

«You're afraid of your own son,» she cried struggling. «Let me go. I'm coming, Herbert; I'm coming.»

There was another knock, and another. The old woman with a sudden wrench broke free and ran from the room. Her husband followed to the landing, and called after her appealingly as she hurried downstairs. He heard the chain rattle back and the bolt drawn slowly and stiffly from the socket. Then the old woman's voice, strained and panting.

«The bolt,» she cried loudly. «Come down. I can't reach it.»

But her husband was on his hands and knees groping wildly on the floor in search of the paw. If only he could find it before the thing outside got in. A perfect fusillade of knocks reverberated through the house, and he heard the scraping of a chair as his wife put it down in the passage against the door. He heard the creaking of the bolt as it came slowly back, and at the same moment he found the monkey's paw, and frantically breathed his third and last wish.

The knocking ceased suddenly, although the echoes of it were still in the house. He heard the chair drawn back, and the door opened. A cold wind rushed up the staircase, and a long loud wail of disappointment and misery from his wife gave him the courage to run down to her side, and then to the gate beyond. The street lamp flickering opposite shone on a quiet and deserted road.

— THE END –

Pride and Prejudice
by Jane Austen
Chapter 1
It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be
on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the
minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful
property of some one or other of their daughters.
“My dear Mr. Bennet,” said his lady to him one day, “have you
heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?”
Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.
“But it is,” returned she; “for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she
told me all about it.”
Mr. Bennet made no answer.
“Do you not want to know who has taken it?” cried his wife impatiently.
“You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.”
This was invitation enough.
“Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is
taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that
he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and
was so much delighted with it, that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of
his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week.”
“What is his name?”
“Bingley.”
“Is he married or single?”
“Oh! Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune;
four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!”
“How so? How can it affect them?”
“My dear Mr. Bennet,” replied his wife, “how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.”
1
“Is that his design in settling here?”
“Design! Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that
he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him
as soon as he comes.”
“I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may
send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you
are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley may like you the best of
the party.”
“My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty,
but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman
has five grown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her
own beauty.”
“In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.”
“But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he
comes into the neighbourhood.”
“It is more than I engage for, I assure you.”
“But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it
would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined
to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no
newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit
him if you do not.”
“You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be
very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him
of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls;
though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.”
“I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than
the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half
so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference.”
“They have none of them much to recommend them,” replied he;
“they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something
more of quickness than her sisters.”
“Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way?
You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor
nerves.”
“You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves.
They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these last twenty years at least.”
“Ah, you do not know what I suffer.”
“But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of
four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.”
2
“It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will
not visit them.”
“Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit
them all.”
Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,
reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had
been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. Her mind
was less difficult to develop. She was a woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented, she fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get
her daughters married; its solace was visiting and news.
Chapter 2
Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He had always intended to visit him, though to the last always
assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the
visit was paid she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the
following manner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her with:
“I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.”
“We are not in a way to know what Mr. Bingley likes,” said her
mother resentfully, “since we are not to visit.”
“But you forget, mamma,” said Elizabeth, “that we shall meet him
at the assemblies, and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce him.”
“I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two
nieces of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no
opinion of her.”
“No more have I,” said Mr. Bennet; “and I am glad to find that you
do not depend on her serving you.”
Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply, but, unable to contain
herself, began scolding one of her daughters.
“Don't keep coughing so, Kitty, for Heaven's sake! Have a little
compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.”
“Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,” said her father; “she times
them ill.”
“I do not cough for my own amusement,” replied Kitty fretfully.
“When is your next ball to be, Lizzy?”
“To-morrow fortnight.”
“Aye, so it is,” cried her mother, “and Mrs. Long does not come
3
back till the day before; so it will be impossible for her to introduce
him, for she will not know him herself.”
“Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and
introduce Mr. Bingley to her.”
“Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted
with him myself; how can you be so teasing?”
“I honour your circumspection. A fortnight's acquaintance is certainly very little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of
a fortnight. But if we do not venture somebody else will; and after all,
Mrs. Long and her daughters must stand their chance; and, therefore,
as she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will
take it on myself.”
The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, “Nonsense,
nonsense!”
“What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?” cried he.
“Do you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid
on them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you there. What say
you, Mary? For you are a young lady of deep reflection, I know, and
read great books and make extracts.”
Mary wished to say something sensible, but knew not how.
“While Mary is adjusting her ideas,” he continued, “let us return to
Mr. Bingley.”
“I am sick of Mr. Bingley,” cried his wife.
“I am sorry to hear that; but why did not you tell me that before? If I
had known as much this morning I certainly would not have called on
him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we cannot
escape the acquaintance now.”
The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of
Mrs. Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though, when the first tumult
of joy was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected
all the while.
“How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should
persuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect
such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is such a good
joke, too, that you should have gone this morning and never said a
word about it till now.”
“Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,” said Mr. Bennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his
wife.
“What an excellent father you have, girls!” said she, when the door
was shut. “I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his
4
kindness; or me, either, for that matter. At our time of life it is not so
pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day; but
for your sakes, we would do anything. Lydia, my love, though you are
the youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next
ball.”
“Oh!” said Lydia stoutly, “I am not afraid; for though I am the
youngest, I'm the tallest.”
The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he
would return Mr. Bennet's visit, and determining when they should
ask him to dinner.
Chapter 3
Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five
daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from her
husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley. They attacked
him in various ways—with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all, and
they were at last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their
neighbour, Lady Lucas. Her report was highly favourable. Sir William
had been delighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at
the next assembly with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love;
and very lively hopes of Mr. Bingley's heart were entertained.
“If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,” said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, “and all the others equally
well married, I shall have nothing to wish for.”
In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet's visit, and sat about
ten minutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes of being
admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard
much; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more
fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper
window that he wore a blue coat, and rode a black horse.
An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her
housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr. Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day, and, consequently, unable to accept the honour of their invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quite
disconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in
5
town so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear
that he might be always flying about from one place to another, and
never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her
fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to
get a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the
assembly. The girls grieved over such a number of ladies, but were
comforted the day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve he
brought only six with him from London—his five sisters and a cousin.
And when the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only
five altogether—Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest,
and another young man.
Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine
women, with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst,
merely looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the
attention of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and the report which was in general circulation within five
minutes after his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared
he was much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with
great admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to
be proud; to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not
all his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a
most forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be
compared with his friend.
Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every
dance, was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one
himself at Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for themselves. What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced
only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being
introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party. His
character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man
in the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there
again. Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose
dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her daughters.
Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to
6
sit down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had
been standing near enough for her to hear a conversation between him
and Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press
his friend to join it.
“Come, Darcy,” said he, “I must have you dance. I hate to see you
standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better
dance.”
“I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as this it
would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me
to stand up with.”
“I would not be so fastidious as you are,” cried Mr. Bingley, “for a
kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls
in my life as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see
uncommonly pretty.”
“You are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,” said
Mr. Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.
“Oh! She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is
one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and
I dare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.”
“Which do you mean?” and turning round he looked for a moment
at Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said:
“She is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt me; I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted
by other men. You had better return to your partner and enjoy her
smiles, for you are wasting your time with me.”
Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings toward him. She told the
story, however, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively,
playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.
The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs. Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the
Netherfield party. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had
been distinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this
as her mother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane's
pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the
most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough never to be without partners, which
was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned,
therefore, in good spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived,
7
and of which they were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With a book he was regardless of time; and on the present
occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the events of an evening
which had raised such splendid expectations. He had rather hoped
that his wife's views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he
soon found out that he had a different story to hear.
“Oh! my dear Mr. Bennet,” as she entered the room, “we have had
a most delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been
there. Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it. Everybody said
how well she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and
danced with her twice! Only think of that, my dear; he actually danced
with her twice! and she was the only creature in the room that he asked
a second time. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see
him stand up with her! But, however, he did not admire her at all;
indeed, nobody can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane
as she was going down the dance. So he inquired who she was, and
got introduced, and asked her for the two next. Then the two third
he danced with Miss King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and
the two fifth with Jane again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the
Boulanger—”
“If he had had any compassion for me,” cried her husband impatiently, “he would not have danced half so much! For God's sake, say
no more of his partners. O that he had sprained his ankle in the first
place!”
“Oh! my dear, I am quite delighted with him. He is so excessively
handsome! And his sisters are charming women. I never in my life
saw anything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the lace upon
Mrs. Hurst's gown—”
Here she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any
description of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another branch
of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some
exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.
“But I can assure you,” she added, “that Lizzy does not lose much
by not suiting his fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not
at all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited that there was no enduring him! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so
very great! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been
there, my dear, to have given him one of your set-downs. I quite detest
the man.”

Chapter 4
When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been
cautious in her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister just
how very much she admired him.
“He is just what a young man ought to be,” said she, “sensible,
good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!—so
much ease, with such perfect good breeding!”
“He is also handsome,” replied Elizabeth, “which a young man
ought likewise to be, if he possibly can. His character is thereby complete.”
“I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time.
I did not expect such a compliment.”
“Did not you? I did for you. But that is one great difference between
us. Compliments always take you by surprise, and me never. What
could be more natural than his asking you again? He could not help
seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman
in the room. No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is
very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many
a stupider person.”
“Dear Lizzy!”
“Oh! you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general. You never see a fault in anybody. All the world are good and
agreeable in your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a human being
in your life.”
“I would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always
speak what I think.”
“I know you do; and it is that which makes the wonder. With your
good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others!
Affectation of candour is common enough—one meets with it everywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or design—to take the
good of everybody's character and make it still better, and say nothing
of the bad—belongs to you alone. And so you like this man's sisters,
too, do you? Their manners are not equal to his.”
“Certainly not—at first. But they are very pleasing women when
you converse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother, and
keep his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very
charming neighbour in her.”
Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and
with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her
9
sister, and with a judgement too unassailed by any attention to herself,
she was very little disposed to approve them. They were in fact very
fine ladies; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor
in the power of making themselves agreeable when they chose it, but
proud and conceited. They were rather handsome, had been educated
in one of the first private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty
thousand pounds, were in the habit of spending more than they ought,
and of associating with people of rank, and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of others. They
were of a respectable family in the north of England; a circumstance
more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother's fortune and their own had been acquired by trade.
Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred
thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an
estate, but did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and
sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided
with a good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many
of those who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might
not spend the remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next
generation to purchase.
His sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own; but,
though he was now only established as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by
no means unwilling to preside at his table—nor was Mrs. Hurst, who
had married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not
been of age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House. He did look at it, and into
it for half-an-hour—was pleased with the situation and the principal
rooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.
Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite
of great opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the
easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition
could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he
never appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy's regard, Bingley had the firmest reliance, and of his judgement the highest opinion.
In understanding, Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means
deficient, but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well-bred, were not
inviting. In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley
was sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually
10
giving offense.
The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic. Bingley had never met with more pleasant people or prettier girls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive to him; there had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon
felt acquainted with all the room; and, as to Miss Bennet, he could not
conceive an angel more beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a
collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for
none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received
either attention or pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty,
but she smiled too much.
Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so—but still they admired her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and
one whom they would not object to know more of. Miss Bennet was
therefore established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorized
by such commendation to think of her as he chose.
Chapter 5
Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the
Bennets were particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and
risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king during
his mayoralty. The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly. It
had given him a disgust to his business, and to his residence in a small
market town; and, in quitting them both, he had removed with his
family to a house about a mile from Meryton, denominated from that
period Lucas Lodge, where he could think with pleasure of his own
importance, and, unshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world. For, though elated by his rank, it did not
render him supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to everybody. By nature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, his presentation at
St. James's had made him courteous.
Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a
valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They had several children. The eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven,
was Elizabeth's intimate friend.
That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk
over a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.
11
“You began the evening well, Charlotte,” said Mrs. Bennet with civil
self-command to Miss Lucas. “You were Mr. Bingley's first choice.”
“Yes; but he seemed to like his second better.”
“Oh! you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her twice.
To be sure that did seem as if he admired her—indeed I rather believe he
did—I heard something about it—but I hardly know what—something
about Mr. Robinson.”
“Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson; did not I mention it to you? Mr. Robinson's asking him how he
liked our Meryton assemblies, and whether he did not think there were
a great many pretty women in the room, and which he thought the prettiest? and his answering immediately to the last question: ‘Oh! the
eldest Miss Bennet, beyond a doubt; there cannot be two opinions on
that point.' ”
“Upon my word! Well, that is very decided indeed—that does seem
as if—but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.”
“My overhearings were more to the purpose than yours, Eliza,” said
Charlotte. “Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend, is
he?—poor Eliza!—to be only just tolerable.”
“I beg you would not put it into Lizzy's head to be vexed by his
ill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man, that it would be quite
a misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last night that he
sat close to her for half-an-hour without once opening his lips.”
“Are you quite sure, ma'am?—is not there a little mistake?” said
Jane. “I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.”
“Aye—because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and
he could not help answering her; but she said he seemed quite angry
at being spoke to.”
“Miss Bingley told me,” said Jane, “that he never speaks much, unless among his intimate acquaintances. With them he is remarkably
agreeable.”
“I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very
agreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how
it was; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare say he
had heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had
come to the ball in a hack chaise.”
“I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,” said Miss Lucas, “but
I wish he had danced with Eliza.”
“Another time, Lizzy,” said her mother, “I would not dance with
him, if I were you.”
“I believe, ma'am, I may safely promise you never to dance with
12
him.”
“His pride,” said Miss Lucas, “does not offend me so much as pride
often does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot wonder that so
very fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour,
should think highly of himself. If I may so express it, he has a right to
be proud.”
“That is very true,” replied Elizabeth, “and I could easily forgive
his pride, if he had not mortified mine.”
“Pride,” observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of
her reflections, “is a very common failing, I believe. By all that I have
ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed; that human
nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us who
do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different things,
though the words are often used synonymously. A person may be
proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.”
“If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,” cried a young Lucas, who came
with his sisters, “I should not care how proud I was. I would keep a
pack of foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine a day.”
“Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,” said
Mrs. Bennet; “and if I were to see you at it, I should take away your
bottle directly.”
The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that
she would, and the argument ended only with the visit.
Chapter 6
The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The
visit was soon returned in due form. Miss Bennet's pleasing manners
grew on the goodwill of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the
mother was found to be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth
speaking to, a wish of being better acquainted with them was expressed
towards the two eldest. By Jane, this attention was received with the
greatest pleasure, but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of everybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like
them; though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration.
It was generally evident whenever they met, that he did admire her
and to her it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the prefer13
ence which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was
in a way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure
that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since
Jane united, with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and
a uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the
suspicions of the impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend Miss
Lucas.
“It may perhaps be pleasant,” replied Charlotte, “to be able to impose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to
be so very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection with the same
skill from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him;
and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally
in the dark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every
attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all begin
freely—a slight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of
us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement.
In nine cases out of ten a women had better show more affection than
she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he may never do
more than like her, if she does not help him on.”
“But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If I
can perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton, indeed, not to
discover it too.”
“Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane's disposition as you
do.”
“But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to
conceal it, he must find it out.”
“Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But, though Bingley
and Jane meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and,
as they always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible
that every moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane
should therefore make the most of every half-hour in which she can
command his attention. When she is secure of him, there will be more
leisure for falling in love as much as she chooses.”
“Your plan is a good one,” replied Elizabeth, “where nothing is in
question but the desire of being well married, and if I were determined
to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it.
But these are not Jane's feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet,
she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its
reasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four
dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own
house, and has since dined with him in company four times. This is
14
not quite enough to make her understand his character.”
“Not as you represent it. Had she merely dined with him, she might
only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must
remember that four evenings have also been spent together—and four
evenings may do a great deal.”
“Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they
both like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other
leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.”
“Well,” said Charlotte, “I wish Jane success with all my heart; and
if she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good
a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for
a twelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance.
If the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other
or ever so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the
least. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to
have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as possible
of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life.”
“You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it is
not sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.”
Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley's attentions to her sister, Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of
some interest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the
ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no
sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she hardly
had a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered
uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes.
To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though
he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light
and pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not
those of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. Of this she was perfectly unaware; to her he was only the man
who made himself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her
handsome enough to dance with.
He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing with her himself, attended to her conversation with others. His
doing so drew her notice. It was at Sir William Lucas's, where a large
party were assembled.
“What does Mr. Darcy mean,” said she to Charlotte, “by listening
to my conversation with Colonel Forster?”
15
“That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.”
“But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see
what he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by
being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him.”
On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to
mention such a subject to him; which immediately provoking Elizabeth
to do it, she turned to him and said:
“Did you not think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly
well just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at
Meryton?”
“With great energy; but it is always a subject which makes a lady
energetic.”
“You are severe on us.”
“It will be her turn soon to be teased,” said Miss Lucas. “I am going
to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows.”
“You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!—always wanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody! If my vanity
had taken a musical turn, you would have been invaluable; but as it
is, I would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the
habit of hearing the very best performers.” On Miss Lucas's persevering, however, she added, “Very well, if it must be so, it must.” And
gravely glancing at Mr. Darcy, “There is a fine old saying, which everybody here is of course familiar with: ‘Keep your breath to cool your
porridge'; and I shall keep mine to swell my song.”
Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After
a song or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several
that she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument
by her sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain
one in the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments,
was always impatient for display.
Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given
her application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited
manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than
she had reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to
with much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary,
at the end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude
by Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who,
with some of the Lucases, and two or three officers, joined eagerly in
dancing at one end of the room.
Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of
16
passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too
much engrossed by his thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was
his neighbour, till Sir William thus began:
“What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy!
There is nothing like dancing after all. I consider it as one of the first
refinements of polished society.”
“Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue
amongst the less polished societies of the world. Every savage can
dance.”
Sir William only smiled. “Your friend performs delightfully,” he
continued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; “and I doubt
not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr. Darcy.”
“You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.”
“Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the
sight. Do you often dance at St. James's?”
“Never, sir.”
“Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?”
“It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.”
“You have a house in town, I conclude?”
Mr. Darcy bowed.
“I had once had some thought of fixing in town myself—for I am
fond of superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of
London would agree with Lady Lucas.”
He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed to make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them,
he was struck with the action of doing a very gallant thing, and called
out to her:
“My dear Miss Eliza, why are you not dancing? Mr. Darcy, you
must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable
partner. You cannot refuse to dance, I am sure when so much beauty
is before you.” And, taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr.
Darcy who, though extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive
it, when she instantly drew back, and said with some discomposure to
Sir William:
“Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. I entreat you
not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner.”
Mr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour of her hand, but in vain. Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir
William at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.
“You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny
me the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the
17
amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige
us for one half-hour.”
“Mr. Darcy is all politeness,” said Elizabeth, smiling.
“He is, indeed; but, considering the inducement, my dear Miss
Eliza, we cannot wonder at his complaisance—for who would object
to such a partner?”
Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Her resistance had not
injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some
complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley:
“I can guess the subject of your reverie.”
“I should imagine not.”
“You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many
evenings in this manner—in such society; and indeed I am quite of
your opinion. I was never more annoyed! The insipidity, and yet the
noise—the nothingness, and yet the self-importance of all those people!
What would I give to hear your strictures on them!”
“You conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more
agreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great pleasure
which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.”
Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired
he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.
Mr. Darcy replied with great intrepidity:
“Miss Elizabeth Bennet.”
“Miss Elizabeth Bennet!” repeated Miss Bingley. “I am all astonishment. How long has she been such a favourite?—and pray, when am I
to wish you joy?”
“That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A lady's
imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love
to matrimony, in a moment. I knew you would be wishing me joy.”
“Nay, if you are serious about it, I shall consider the matter is absolutely settled. You will be having a charming mother-in-law, indeed;
and, of course, she will always be at Pemberley with you.”
He listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to entertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced her that
all was safe, her wit flowed long.
Chapter 7
Mr. Bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two
thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed,
18
in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother's fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply the
deficiency of his. Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and had
left her four thousand pounds.
She had a sister married to a Mr. Phillips, who had been a clerk to
their father and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in
London in a respectable line of trade.
The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most
convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted
thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and
to a milliner's shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family, Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions;
their minds were more vacant than their sisters', and when nothing
better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare
of news the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn
some from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both
with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in
the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton
was the headquarters.
Their visits to Mrs. Phillips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence. Every day added something to their knowledge of
the officers' names and connections. Their lodgings were not long a
secret, and at length they began to know the officers themselves. Mr.
Phillips visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a store of felicity unknown before. They could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr.
Bingley's large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their
mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals
of an ensign.
After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr.
Bennet coolly observed:
“From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be
two of the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it some time,
but I am now convinced.”
Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with
perfect indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain
Carter, and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was
going the next morning to London.
“I am astonished, my dear,” said Mrs. Bennet, “that you should be
so ready to think your own children silly. If I wished to think slightingly of anybody's children, it should not be of my own, however.”
19
“If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of it.”
“Yes—but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.”
“This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree.
I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I
must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters
uncommonly foolish.”
“My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the
sense of their father and mother. When they get to our age, I dare say
they will not think about officers any more than we do. I remember the
time when I liked a red coat myself very well—and, indeed, so I do still
at my heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a
year, should want one of my girls I shall not say nay to him; and I
thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir
William's in his regimentals.”
“Mamma,” cried Lydia, “my aunt says that Colonel Forster and
Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson's as they did when
they first came; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke's library.”
Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman
with a note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant
waited for an answer. Mrs. Bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure, and
she was eagerly calling out, while her daughter read,
“Well, Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does he say?
Well, Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.”
“It is from Miss Bingley,” said Jane, and then read it aloud.
“My dear friend,—
“If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and
me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives,
for a whole day's tete- ˆ a-t ` ete between two women can never end with- ˆ
out a quarrel. Come as soon as you can on receipt of this. My brother
and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers.—Yours ever,
“Caroline Bingley”
“With the officers!” cried Lydia. “I wonder my aunt did not tell us
of that.”
“Dining out,” said Mrs. Bennet, “that is very unlucky.”
“Can I have the carriage?” said Jane.
“No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems
likely to rain; and then you must stay all night.”
20
“That would be a good scheme,” said Elizabeth, “if you were sure
that they would not offer to send her home.”
“Oh! but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley's chaise to go to
Meryton, and the Hursts have no horses to theirs.”
“I had much rather go in the coach.”
“But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure. They
are wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are they not?”
“They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.”
“But if you have got them to-day,” said Elizabeth, “my mother's
purpose will be answered.”
She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the
horses were engaged. Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback,
and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day. Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone
long before it rained hard. Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her
mother was delighted. The rain continued the whole evening without
intermission; Jane certainly could not come back.
“This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!” said Mrs. Bennet more
than once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. Till the
next morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield
brought the following note for Elizabeth:
“My dearest Lizzy,—
“I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be
imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends will not
hear of my returning till I am better. They insist also on my seeing Mr.
Jones—therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having
been to me—and, excepting a sore throat and headache, there is not
much the matter with me.—Yours, etc.”
“Well, my dear,” said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note
aloud, “if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness—if she
should die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of
Mr. Bingley, and under your orders.”
“Oh! I am not afraid of her dying. People do not die of little trifling
colds. She will be taken good care of. As long as she stays there, it is
all very well. I would go and see her if I could have the carriage.”
Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her,
though the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horsewoman,
walking was her only alternative. She declared her resolution.
21
“How can you be so silly,” cried her mother, “as to think of such a
thing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when you get there.”
“I shall be very fit to see Jane—which is all I want.”
“Is this a hint to me, Lizzy,” said her father, “to send for the horses?”
“No, indeed, I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is nothing when one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back by dinner.”
“I admire the activity of your benevolence,” observed Mary, “but
every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion, exertion should always be in proportion to what is required.”
“We will go as far as Meryton with you,” said Catherine and Lydia.
Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off
together.
“If we make haste,” said Lydia, as they walked along, “perhaps we
may see something of Captain Carter before he goes.”
In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings
of one of the officers' wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone,
crossing field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself at last
within view of the house, with weary ankles, dirty stockings, and a
face glowing with the warmth of exercise.
She was shown into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were
assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise.
That she should have walked three miles so early in the day, in such
dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and
Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it. She was received, however, very politely by them; and
in their brother's manners there was something better than politeness;
there was good humour and kindness. Mr. Darcy said very little, and
Mr. Hurst nothing at all. The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion, and
doubt as to the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone. The latter
was thinking only of his breakfast.
Her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered.
Miss Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and not
well enough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her
immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much
she longed for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was
not equal, however, to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left
them together, could attempt little besides expressions of gratitude for
the extraordinary kindness she was treated with. Elizabeth silently at22
tended her.
When breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and
solicitude they showed for Jane. The apothecary came, and having examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught
a violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it;
advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The
advice was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and
her head ached acutely. Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment;
nor were the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they
had, in fact, nothing to do elsewhere.
When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and
very unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and
she only wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such
concern in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert
the offer of the chaise to an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the
present. Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring
back a supply of clothes.
Chapter 8
At five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past six
Elizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil inquiries which then
poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing
the much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley's, she could not make a
very favourable answer. Jane was by no means better. The sisters, on
hearing this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved,
how shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they
disliked being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter:
and their indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them
restored Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her former dislike.
Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she
could regard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was evident,
and his attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her
feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered
by the others. She had very little notice from any but him. Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for
Mr. Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived
only to eat, drink, and play at cards; who, when he found her to prefer
23
a plain dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.
When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and
impertinence; she had no conversation, no style, no beauty. Mrs. Hurst
thought the same, and added:
“She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent walker. I shall never forget her appearance this morning. She really looked almost wild.”
“She did, indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance.
Very nonsensical to come at all! Why must she be scampering about the
country, because her sister had a cold? Her hair, so untidy, so blowsy!”
“Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches
deep in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been
let down to hide it not doing its office.”
“Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,” said Bingley; “but this
was all lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room this morning. Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice.”
“You observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley; “and I
am inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make
such an exhibition.”
“Certainly not.”
“To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it
is, above her ankles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! What could she
mean by it? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited
independence, a most country-town indifference to decorum.”
“It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,” said Bingley.
“I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,” observed Miss Bingley in a half whisper,
“that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine
eyes.”
“Not at all,” he replied; “they were brightened by the exercise.” A
short pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again:
“I have a excessive regard for Miss Jane Bennet, she is really a very
sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled. But with
such a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there
is no chance of it.”
“I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney on
Meryton.”
24
“Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.”
“That is capital,” added her sister, and they both laughed heartily.
“If they had uncles enough to fill all Cheapside,” cried Bingley, “it
would not make them one jot less agreeable.”
“But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of
any consideration in the world,” replied Darcy.
To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their
hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of
their dear friend's vulgar relations.
With a renewal of tenderness, however, they returned to her room
on leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee. She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all,
till late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her sleep,
and when it seemed to her rather right than pleasant that she should
go downstairs herself. On entering the drawing-room she found the
whole party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister
the excuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could
stay below, with a book. Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.
“Do you prefer reading to cards?” said he; “that is rather singular.”
“Miss Eliza Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, “despises cards. She is a
great reader, and has no pleasure in anything else.”
“I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,” cried Elizabeth; “I
am not a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.”
“In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,” said Bingley;
“and I hope it will be soon increased by seeing her quite well.”
Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards
the table where a few books were lying. He immediately offered to
fetch her others—all that his library afforded.
“And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own
credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more
than I ever looked into.”
Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with
those in the room.
“I am astonished,” said Miss Bingley, “that my father should have
left so small a collection of books. What a delightful library you have
at Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!”
“It ought to be good,” he replied, “it has been the work of many
generations.”
“And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always
25
buying books.”
“I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days
as these.”
“Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties
of that noble place. Charles, when you build your house, I wish it may
be half as delightful as Pemberley.”
“I wish it may.”
“But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is not a finer
county in England than Derbyshire.”
“With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it.”
“I am talking of possibilities, Charles.”
“Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get
Pemberley by purchase than by imitation.”
Elizabeth was so much caught with what passed, as to leave her
very little attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she
drew near the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley
and his eldest sister, to observe the game.
“Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?” said Miss Bingley;
“will she be as tall as I am?”
“I think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet's height,
or rather taller.”
“How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me so much. Such a countenance, such manners! And so extremely accomplished for her age! Her performance on the pianoforte
is exquisite.”
“It is amazing to me,” said Bingley, “how young ladies can have
patience to be so very accomplished as they all are.”
“All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you
mean?”
“Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover screens, and
net purses. I scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this, and I am
sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without
being informed that she was very accomplished.”
“Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,” said Darcy,
“has too much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen.
But I am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies
in general. I cannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen, in the
whole range of my acquaintance, that are really accomplished.”
“Nor I, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley.
26
“Then,” observed Elizabeth, “you must comprehend a great deal in
your idea of an accomplished woman.”
“Yes, I do comprehend a great deal in it.”
“Oh! certainly,” cried his faithful assistant, “no one can be really
esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music,
singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the
word; and besides all this, she must possess a certain something in her
air and manner of walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word will be but half-deserved.”
“All this she must possess,” added Darcy, “and to all this she must
yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind
by extensive reading.”
“I am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished
women. I rather wonder now at your knowing any.”
“Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility
of all this?”
“I never saw such a woman. I never saw such capacity, and taste,
and application, and elegance, as you describe united.”
Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice
of her implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many
women who answered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them
to order, with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going
forward. As all conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon
afterwards left the room.
“Elizabeth Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on
her, “is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves
to the other sex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare
say, it succeeds. But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean
art.”
“Undoubtedly,” replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly
addressed, “there is a meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes
condescend to employ for captivation. Whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable.”
Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject.
Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse,
and that she could not leave her. Bingley urged Mr. Jones being sent for
immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could
be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most
eminent physicians. This she would not hear of; but she was not so
27
unwilling to comply with their brother's proposal; and it was settled
that Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet
were not decidedly better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters
declared that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness,
however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief
to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every
attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.
Chapter 9
Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room, and in
the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer
to the inquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a
housemaid, and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who
waited on his sisters. In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit
Jane, and form her own judgement of her situation. The note was immediately dispatched, and its contents as quickly complied with. Mrs.
Bennet, accompanied by her two youngest girls, reached Netherfield
soon after the family breakfast.
Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would
have been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her
illness was not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her restoration to health would probably remove her from
Netherfield. She would not listen, therefore, to her daughter's proposal of being carried home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived
about the same time, think it at all advisable. After sitting a little while
with Jane, on Miss Bingley's appearance and invitation, the mother and
three daughter all attended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley met
them with hopes that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse
than she expected.
“Indeed I have, sir,” was her answer. “She is a great deal too ill to
be moved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her. We must
trespass a little longer on your kindness.”
“Removed!” cried Bingley. “It must not be thought of. My sister, I
am sure, will not hear of her removal.”
“You may depend upon it, Madam,” said Miss Bingley, with cold
civility, “that Miss Bennet will receive every possible attention while
she remains with us.”
Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.
28
“I am sure,” she added, “if it was not for such good friends I do not
know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers
a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is
always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest
temper I have ever met with. I often tell my other girls they are nothing to her. You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming
prospect over the gravel walk. I do not know a place in the country
that is equal to Netherfield. You will not think of quitting it in a hurry,
I hope, though you have but a short lease.”
“Whatever I do is done in a hurry,” replied he; “and therefore if
I should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five
minutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here.”
“That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,” said Elizabeth.
“You begin to comprehend me, do you?” cried he, turning towards
her.
“Oh! yes—I understand you perfectly.”
“I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen
through I am afraid is pitiful.”
“That is as it happens. It does not follow that a deep, intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.”
“Lizzy,” cried her mother, “remember where you are, and do not
run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.”
“I did not know before,” continued Bingley immediately, “that you
were a studier of character. It must be an amusing study.”
“Yes, but intricate characters are the most amusing. They have at
least that advantage.”
“The country,” said Darcy, “can in general supply but a few subjects for such a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in a very
confined and unvarying society.”
“But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new
to be observed in them for ever.”
“Yes, indeed,” cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood. “I assure you there is quite as much
of that going on in the country as in town.”
Everybody was surprised, and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment, turned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained
a complete victory over him, continued her triumph.
“I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country,
for my part, except the shops and public places. The country is a vast
deal pleasanter, is it not, Mr. Bingley?”
29
“When I am in the country,” he replied, “I never wish to leave it;
and when I am in town it is pretty much the same. They have each
their advantages, and I can be equally happy in either.”
“Aye—that is because you have the right disposition. But that gentleman,” looking at Darcy, “seemed to think the country was nothing
at all.”
“Indeed, Mamma, you are mistaken,” said Elizabeth, blushing for
her mother. “You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that there
was not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the
town, which you must acknowledge to be true.”
“Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting
with many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few neighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with four-and-twenty families.”
Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his
countenance. His sister was less delicate, and directed her eyes towards Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile. Elizabeth, for the sake
of saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts, now asked
her if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since her coming away.
“Yes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man
Sir William is, Mr. Bingley, is not he? So much the man of fashion! So
genteel and easy! He had always something to say to everybody. That
is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves
very important, and never open their mouths, quite mistake the matter.”
“Did Charlotte dine with you?”
“No, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the mincepies. For my part, Mr. Bingley, I always keep servants that can do their
own work; my daughters are brought up very differently. But everybody is to judge for themselves, and the Lucases are a very good sort of
girls, I assure you. It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that I think
Charlotte so very plain—but then she is our particular friend.”
“She seems a very pleasant young woman.”
“Oh! dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas
herself has often said so, and envied me Jane's beauty. I do not like
to boast of my own child, but to be sure, Jane—one does not often
see anybody better looking. It is what everybody says. I do not trust
my own partiality. When she was only fifteen, there was a man at my
brother Gardiner's in town so much in love with her that my sister-inlaw was sure he would make her an offer before we came away. But,
however, he did not. Perhaps he thought her too young. However, he
wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were.”
30
“And so ended his affection,” said Elizabeth impatiently. “There
has been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder
who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!”
“I have been used to consider poetry as the food of love,” said Darcy.
“Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everything nourishes what is
strong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I am
convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.”
Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made
Elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again.
She longed to speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a
short silence Mrs. Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley
for his kindness to Jane, with an apology for troubling him also with
Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced
his younger sister to be civil also, and say what the occasion required.
She performed her part indeed without much graciousness, but Mrs.
Bennet was satisfied, and soon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon
this signal, the youngest of her daughters put herself forward. The two
girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit, and the
result of it was, that the youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with having
promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at Netherfield.
Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion
and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose
affection had brought her into public at an early age. She had high animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the attention
of the officers, to whom her uncle's good dinners, and her own easy
manners recommended her, had increased into assurance. She was
very equal, therefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball,
and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be
the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. His answer
to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother's ear:
“I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and
when your sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very
day of the ball. But you would not wish to be dancing when she is ill.”
Lydia declared herself satisfied. “Oh! yes—it would be much better
to wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter
would be at Meryton again. And when you have given your ball,” she
added, “I shall insist on their giving one also. I shall tell Colonel Forster
it will be quite a shame if he does not.”
Mrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations' behaviour
31
to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom,
however, could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her, in
spite of all Miss Bingley's witticisms on fine eyes.
Chapter 10
The day passed much as the day before had done. Mrs. Hurst and
Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid,
who continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening Elizabeth
joined their party in the drawing-room. The loo-table, however, did
not appear. Mr. Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him,
was watching the progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his
attention by messages to his sister. Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at
piquet, and Mrs. Hurst was observing their game.
Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused
in attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion. The
perpetual commendations of the lady, either on his handwriting, or on
the evenness of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received, formed a curious
dialogue, and was exactly in union with her opinion of each.
“How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!”
He made no answer.
“You write uncommonly fast.”
“You are mistaken. I write rather slowly.”
“How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course
of a year! Letters of business, too! How odious I should think them!”
“It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of yours.”
“Pray tell your sister that I long to see her.”
“I have already told her so once, by your desire.”
“I am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me mend it for you. I
mend pens remarkably well.”
“Thank you—but I always mend my own.”
“How can you contrive to write so even?”
He was silent.
“Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the
harp; and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss
Grantley's.”
“Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again? At
present I have not room to do them justice.”
32
“Oh! it is of no consequence. I shall see her in January. But do you
always write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?”
“They are generally long; but whether always charming it is not for
me to determine.”
“It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter with
ease, cannot write ill.”
“That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,” cried her
brother, “because he does not write with ease. He studies too much for
words of four syllables. Do not you, Darcy?”
“My style of writing is very different from yours.”
“Oh!” cried Miss Bingley, “Charles writes in the most careless way
imaginable. He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest.”
“My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them—
by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my
correspondents.”
“Your humility, Mr. Bingley,” said Elizabeth, “must disarm reproof.”
“Nothing is more deceitful,” said Darcy, “than the appearance of
humility. It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an
indirect boast.”
“And which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty?”
“The indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in
writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of
thought and carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, you
think at least highly interesting. The power of doing anything with
quickness is always prized much by the possessor, and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance. When you
told Mrs. Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved upon quitting
Netherfield you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a
sort of panegyric, of compliment to yourself—and yet what is there so
very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone
else?”
“Nay,” cried Bingley, “this is too much, to remember at night all
the foolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon my
honour, I believe what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this
moment. At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless
precipitance merely to show off before the ladies.”
“I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that
you would be gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite as
33
dependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were
mounting your horse, a friend were to say, ‘Bingley, you had better
stay till next week,' you would probably do it, you would probably
not go—and at another word, might stay a month.”
“You have only proved by this,” cried Elizabeth, “that Mr. Bingley
did not do justice to his own disposition. You have shown him off now
much more than he did himself.”
“I am exceedingly gratified,” said Bingley, “by your converting
what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper.
But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by
no means intend; for he would certainly think better of me, if under
such a circumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I
could.”
“Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intentions as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?”
“Upon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter; Darcy must
speak for himself.”
“You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call
mine, but which I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case, however, to stand according to your representation, you must remember,
Miss Bennet, that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the
house, and the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without
offering one argument in favour of its propriety.”
“To yield readily—easily—to the persuasion of a friend is no merit
with you.”
“To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either.”
“You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of
friendship and affection. A regard for the requester would often make
one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason one into it. I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you
have supposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as well wait, perhaps, till
the circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon. But in general and ordinary cases between friend and
friend, where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment, should you think ill of that person for
complying with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?”
“Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to
arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is
to appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting
between the parties?”
34
“By all means,” cried Bingley; “let us hear all the particulars, not
forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more
weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of. I assure you, that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison
with myself, I should not pay him half so much deference. I declare I
do not know a more awful object than Darcy, on particular occasions,
and in particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday
evening, when he has nothing to do.”
Mr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he
was rather offended, and therefore checked her laugh. Miss Bingley
warmly resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation
with her brother for talking such nonsense.
“I see your design, Bingley,” said his friend. “You dislike an argument, and want to silence this.”
“Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and
Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very
thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.”
“What you ask,” said Elizabeth, “is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr.
Darcy had much better finish his letter.”
Mr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.
When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth for an indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley moved with some
alacrity to the pianoforte; and, after a polite request that Elizabeth
would lead the way which the other as politely and more earnestly
negatived, she seated herself.
Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed, Elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over some
music-books that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy's
eyes were fixed on her. She hardly knew how to suppose that she
could be an object of admiration to so great a man; and yet that he
should look at her because he disliked her, was still more strange. She
could only imagine, however, at last that she drew his notice because
there was something more wrong and reprehensible, according to his
ideas of right, than in any other person present. The supposition did
not pain her. She liked him too little to care for his approbation.
After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm
by a lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing near
Elizabeth, said to her:
“Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an
opportunity of dancing a reel?”
She smiled, but made no answer. He repeated the question, with
35
some surprise at her silence.
“Oh!” said she, “I heard you before, but I could not immediately
determine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say ‘Yes,'
that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always
delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person
of their premeditated contempt. I have, therefore, made up my mind
to tell you, that I do not want to dance a reel at all—and now despise
me if you dare.”
“Indeed I do not dare.”
Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his
gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her
manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and Darcy
had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. He
really believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections,
he should be in some danger.
Miss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great
anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.
She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an
alliance.
“I hope,” said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery
the next day, “you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this
desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue;
and if you can compass it, do sure the younger girls of running after officers. And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to check
that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence, which
your lady possesses.”
“Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?”
“Oh! yes. Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Phillips be
placed in the gallery at Pemberley. Put them next to your great-uncle
the judge. They are in the same profession, you know, only in different
lines. As for your Elizabeth's picture, you must not have it taken, for
what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?”
“It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their
colour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, might be
copied.”
At that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst
and Elizabeth herself.
“I did not know that you intended to walk,” said Miss Bingley, in
some confusion, lest they had been overheard.
36
“You used us abominably ill,” answered Mrs. Hurst, “running
away without telling us that you were coming out.”
Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth
to walk by herself. The path just admitted three. Mr. Darcy felt their
rudeness, and immediately said:
“This walk is not wide enough for our party. We had better go into
the avenue.”
But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with
them, laughingly answered:
“No, no; stay where you are. You are charmingly grouped, and
appear to uncommon advantage. The picturesque would be spoilt by
admitting a fourth. Good-bye.”
She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of
being at home again in a day or two. Jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.
Chapter 11
When the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her sister,
and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the drawingroom, where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable
as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared. Their powers of conversation were considerable. They could
describe an entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit.
But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object;
Miss Bingley's eyes were instantly turned toward Darcy, and she had
something to say to him before he had advanced many steps. He addressed himself to Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst
also made her a slight bow, and said he was “very glad;” but diffuseness and warmth remained for Bingley's salutation. He was full of joy
and attention. The first half-hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest
she should suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his
desire to the other side of the fireplace, that she might be further from
the door. He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone else.
Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great delight.
When tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the
card-table—but in vain. She had obtained private intelligence that Mr.
Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr. Hurst soon found even his open
37
petition rejected. She assured him that no one intended to play, and
the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her. Mr.
Hurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the
sofas and go to sleep. Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same;
and Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and
rings, joined now and then in her brother's conversation with Miss
Bennet.
Miss Bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching
Mr. Darcy's progress through his book, as in reading her own; and she
was perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page.
She could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her question, and read on. At length, quite exhausted by the
attempt to be amused with her own book, which she had only chosen
because it was the second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and
said, “How pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way! I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires
of anything than of a book! When I have a house of my own, I shall be
miserable if I have not an excellent library.”
No one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her
book, and cast her eyes round the room in quest for some amusement;
when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned
suddenly towards him and said:
“By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance
at Netherfield? I would advise you, before you determine on it, to
consult the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there
are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment
than a pleasure.”
“If you mean Darcy,” cried her brother, “he may go to bed, if he
chooses, before it begins—but as for the ball, it is quite a settled thing;
and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough, I shall send
round my cards.”
“I should like balls infinitely better,” she replied, “if they were carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It would surely be much
more rational if conversation instead of dancing were made the order
of the day.”
“Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not
be near so much like a ball.”
Miss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards she got up and
walked about the room. Her figure was elegant, and she walked well;
but Darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. In
38
the desperation of her feelings, she resolved on one effort more, and,
turning to Elizabeth, said:
“Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example,
and take a turn about the room. I assure you it is very refreshing after
sitting so long in one attitude.”
Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss Bingley
succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr. Darcy looked up.
He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as
Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book. He was
directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing that
he could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and
down the room together, with either of which motives his joining them
would interfere. “What could he mean? She was dying to know what
could be his meaning?”—and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all
understand him?
“Not at all,” was her answer; “but depend upon it, he means to be
severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask
nothing about it.”
Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy
in anything, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of
his two motives.
“I have not the smallest objection to explaining them,” said he, as
soon as she allowed him to speak. “You either choose this method of
passing the evening because you are in each other's confidence, and
have secret affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your
figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking; if the first, I would
be completely in your way, and if the second, I can admire you much
better as I sit by the fire.”
“Oh! shocking!” cried Miss Bingley. “I never heard anything so
abominable. How shall we punish him for such a speech?”
“Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,” said Elizabeth.
“We can all plague and punish one another. Tease him—laugh at him.
Intimate as you are, you must know how it is to be done.”
“But upon my honour, I do not. I do assure you that my intimacy
has not yet taught me that. Tease calmness of manner and presence of
mind! No, no—feel he may defy us there. And as to laughter, we will
not expose ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a
subject. Mr. Darcy may hug himself.”
“Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!” cried Elizabeth. “That is an
uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it
would be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintances. I dearly
39
love a laugh.”
“Miss Bingley,” said he, “has given me more credit than can be. The
wisest and the best of men—nay, the wisest and best of their actions—
may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a
joke.”
“Certainly,” replied Elizabeth—“there are such people, but I hope
I am not one of them. I hope I never ridicule what is wise and good.
Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, do divert me, I own,
and I laugh at them whenever I can. But these, I suppose, are precisely
what you are without.”
“Perhaps that is not possible for anyone. But it has been the study
of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule.”
“Such as vanity and pride.”
“Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride—where there is a real
superiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation.”
Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.
“Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume,” said Miss Bingley; “and pray what is the result?”
“I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect. He
owns it himself without disguise.”
“No,” said Darcy, “I have made no such pretension. I have faults
enough, but they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I dare
not vouch for. It is, I believe, too little yielding—certainly too little for
the convenience of the world. I cannot forget the follies and vices of
other so soon as I ought, nor their offenses against myself. My feelings
are not puffed about with every attempt to move them. My temper
would perhaps be called resentful. My good opinion once lost, is lost
forever.”
“That is a failing indeed!” cried Elizabeth. “Implacable resentment
is a shade in a character. But you have chosen your fault well. I really
cannot laugh at it. You are safe from me.”
“There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil—a natural defect, which not even the best education can
overcome.”
“And your defect is to hate everybody.”
“And yours,” he replied with a smile, “is willfully to misunderstand them.”
“Do let us have a little music,” cried Miss Bingley, tired of a conversation in which she had no share. “Louisa, you will not mind my
waking Mr. Hurst?”
40
Her sister had not the smallest objection, and the pianoforte was
opened; and Darcy, after a few moments' recollection, was not sorry for
it. He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention.
Chapter 12
In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth
wrote the next morning to their mother, to beg that the carriage might
be sent for them in the course of the day. But Mrs. Bennet, who had
calculated on her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following
Tuesday, which would exactly finish Jane's week, could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before. Her answer, therefore, was
not propitious, at least not to Elizabeth's wishes, for she was impatient
to get home. Mrs. Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly
have the carriage before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added,
that if Mr. Bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could
spare them very well. Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was
positively resolved—nor did she much expect it would be asked; and
fearful, on the contrary, as being considered as intruding themselves
needlessly long, she urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley's carriage immediately, and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving
Netherfield that morning should be mentioned, and the request made.
The communication excited many professions of concern; and
enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following
day to work on Jane; and till the morrow their going was deferred.
Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her
jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the
other.
The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to
go so soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would
not be safe for her—that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was
firm where she felt herself to be right.
To Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence—Elizabeth had been at
Netherfield long enough. She attracted him more than he liked—and
Miss Bingley was uncivil to her, and more teasing than usual to himself.
He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration
should now escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hope
of influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in
confirming or crushing it. Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke ten
41
words to her through the whole of Saturday, and though they were at
one time left by themselves for half-an-hour, he adhered most conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.
On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to
almost all, took place. Miss Bingley's civility to Elizabeth increased
at last very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they
parted, after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give
her to see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her
most tenderly, she even shook hands with the former. Elizabeth took
leave of the whole party in the liveliest of spirits.
They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. Mrs.
Bennet wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to
give so much trouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again.
But their father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was
really glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle. The evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost
much of its animation, and almost all its sense by the absence of Jane
and Elizabeth.
They found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough-bass and
human nature; and had some extracts to admire, and some new observations of threadbare morality to listen to. Catherine and Lydia had information for them of a different sort. Much had been done and much
had been said in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle, a private had been
flogged, and it had actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going
to be married.
Chapter 13
“I hope, my dear,” said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they were at
breakfast the next morning, “that you have ordered a good dinner today, because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party.”
“Who do you mean, my dear? I know of nobody that is coming, I
am sure, unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in—and I hope
my dinners are good enough for her. I do not believe she often sees
such at home.”
“The person of whom I speak is a gentleman, and a stranger.”
Mrs. Bennet's eyes sparkled. “A gentleman and a stranger! It is Mr.
Bingley, I am sure! Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr.
Bingley. But—good Lord! how unlucky! There is not a bit of fish to
42
be got to-day. Lydia, my love, ring the bell—I must speak to Hill this
moment.”
“It is not Mr. Bingley,” said her husband; “it is a person whom I
never saw in the whole course of my life.”
This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and his five daughters at once.
After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained:
“About a month ago I received this letter; and about a fortnight ago
I answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring
early attention. It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who, when I am
dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases.”
“Oh! my dear,” cried his wife, “I cannot bear to hear that mentioned. Pray do not talk of that odious man. I do think it is the hardest
thing in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your
own children; and I am sure, if I had been you, I should have tried long
ago to do something or other about it.”
Jane and Elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an entail.
They had often attempted to do it before, but it was a subject on which
Mrs. Bennet was beyond the reach of reason, and she continued to rail
bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family
of five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything
about.
“It certainly is a most iniquitous affair,” said Mr. Bennet, “and nothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn. But if
you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps be a little softened by his
manner of expressing himself.”
“No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it is very impertinent
of him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical. I hate such false
friends. Why could he not keep on quarreling with you, as his father
did before him?”
“Why, indeed; he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that
head, as you will hear.”
“Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent,
15th October.
“Dear Sir,—
“The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father always gave me much uneasiness, and since I have had
the misfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal the breach;
but for some time I was kept back by my own doubts, fearing lest it
43
might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms
with anyone with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance.—
'There, Mrs. Bennet.'—My mind, however, is now made up on the subject, for having received ordination at Easter, I have been so fortunate
as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady
Catherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh, whose bounty
and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish,
where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those
rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the Church of England.
As a clergyman, moreover, I feel it my duty to promote and establish
the blessing of peace in all families within in the reach of my influence; and on these grounds I flatter myself that my present overtures
are highly commendable, and that the circumstance of my being next
in the entail of Longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your
side, and not lead you to reject the offered olive-branch. I cannot be
otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable
daughters, and beg leave to apologise for it, as well as to assure you of
my readiness to make them every possible amends—but of this hereafter. If you should have no objection to receive me into your house,
I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family,
Monday, November 18th, by four o'clock, and shall probably trespass
on your hospitality till the Saturday se'ennight following, which I can
do without any inconvenience, as Lady Catherine is far from objecting
to my occasional absence on a Sunday, provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day.—I remain, dear sir, with
respectful compliments to your lady and daughters, your well-wisher
and friend,
“William Collins”
“At four o'clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman,” said Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter. “He seems to be a
most conscientious and polite young man, upon my word, and I doubt
not will prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine
should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again.”
“There is some sense in what he says about the girls, however, and
if he is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to
discourage him.”
“Though it is difficult,” said Jane, “to guess in what way he can
mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly
to his credit.”
44
Elizabeth was chiefly struck by his extraordinary deference for
Lady Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and
burying his parishioners whenever it were required.
“He must be an oddity, I think,” said she. “I cannot make him
out.—There is something very pompous in his style.—And what can
he mean by apologising for being next in the entail?—We cannot suppose he would help it if he could.—Could he be a sensible man, sir?”
“No, my dear, I think not. I have great hopes of finding him quite
the reverse. There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his
letter, which promises well. I am impatient to see him.”
“In point of composition,” said Mary, “the letter does not seem defective. The idea of the olive-branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I
think it is well expressed.”
To Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in any
degree interesting. It was next to impossible that their cousin should
come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour. As for
their mother, Mr. Collins's letter had done away much of her ill-will,
and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which
astonished her husband and daughters.
Mr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great
politeness by the whole family. Mr. Bennet indeed said little; but the
ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins seemed neither in
need of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself. He was a
tall, heavy-looking young man of five-and-twenty. His air was grave
and stately, and his manners were very formal. He had not been long
seated before he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family
of daughters; said he had heard much of their beauty, but that in this
instance fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did not
doubt her seeing them all in due time disposed of in marriage. This
gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers; but Mrs.
Bennet, who quarreled with no compliments, answered most readily.
“You are very kind, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may
prove so, for else they will be destitute enough. Things are settled so
oddly.”
“You allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate.”
“Ah! sir, I do indeed. It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you
must confess. Not that I mean to find fault with you, for such things
I know are all chance in this world. There is no knowing how estates
will go when once they come to be entailed.”
“I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins,
45
and could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing
forward and precipitate. But I can assure the young ladies that I come
prepared to admire them. At present I will not say more; but, perhaps,
when we are better acquainted—”
He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled
on each other. They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins's admiration. The hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture, were examined
and praised; and his commendation of everything would have touched
Mrs. Bennet's heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing
it all as his own future property. The dinner too in its turn was highly
admired; and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellency of its cooking was owing. But he was set right there by Mrs.
Bennet, who assured him with some asperity that they were very well
able to keep a good cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in
the kitchen. He begged pardon for having displeased her. In a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended; but he continued to
apologise for about a quarter of an hour.
Chapter 14
During dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation
with his guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him
to shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness.
Lady Catherine de Bourgh's attention to his wishes, and consideration
for his comfort, appeared very remarkable. Mr. Bennet could not have
chosen better. Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise. The subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most
important aspect he protested that “he had never in his life witnessed
such behaviour in a person of rank—such affability and condescension,
as he had himself experienced from Lady Catherine. She had been
graciously pleased to approve of both of the discourses which he had
already had the honour of preaching before her. She had also asked
him twice to dine at Rosings, and had sent for him only the Saturday
before, to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening. Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew, but he had never
seen anything but affability in her. She had always spoken to him as
she would to any other gentleman; she made not the smallest objection
to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood nor to his leaving
the parish occasionally for a week or two, to visit his relations. She
46
had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could,
provided he chose with discretion; and had once paid him a visit in
his humble parsonage, where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed to suggest some
herself—some shelves in the closet upstairs.”
“That is all very proper and civil, I am sure,” said Mrs. Bennet, “and
I dare say she is a very agreeable woman. It is a pity that great ladies
in general are not more like her. Does she live near you, sir?”
“The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only
by a lane from Rosings Park, her ladyship's residence.”
“I think you said she was a widow, sir? Has she any family?”
“She has only one daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very
extensive property.”
“Ah!” said Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, “then she is better off
than many girls. And what sort of young lady is she? Is she handsome?”
“She is a most charming young lady indeed. Lady Catherine herself says that, in point of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far superior
to the handsomest of her sex, because there is that in her features
which marks the young lady of distinguished birth. She is unfortunately of a sickly constitution, which has prevented her from making
that progress in many accomplishments which she could not have otherwise failed of, as I am informed by the lady who superintended her
education, and who still resides with them. But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little
phaeton and ponies.”
“Has she been presented? I do not remember her name among the
ladies at court.”
“Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in
town; and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine one day, has deprived the British court of its brightest ornaments. Her ladyship
seemed pleased with the idea; and you may imagine that I am happy
on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are
always acceptable to ladies. I have more than once observed to Lady
Catherine, that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess,
and that the most elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence,
would be adorned by her. These are the kind of little things which
please her ladyship, and it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay.”
“You judge very properly,” said Mr. Bennet, “and it is happy for
you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. May I ask
47
whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are the result of previous study?”
“They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though I
sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always
wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible.”
Mr. Bennet's expectations were fully answered. His cousin was as
absurd as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment, maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of
countenance, and, except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner in his pleasure.
By tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and Mr. Bennet
was glad to take his guest into the drawing-room again, and, when tea
was over, glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies. Mr. Collins
readily assented, and a book was produced; but, on beholding it (for
everything announced it to be from a circulating library), he started
back, and begging pardon, protested that he never read novels. Kitty
stared at him, and Lydia exclaimed. Other books were produced, and
after some deliberation he chose Fordyce's Sermons. Lydia gaped as he
opened the volume, and before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, she interrupted him with:
“Do you know, mamma, that my uncle Phillips talks of turning
away Richard; and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him. My aunt
told me so herself on Saturday. I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow
to hear more about it, and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from
town.”
Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr.
Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said:
“I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by
books of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit. It
amazes me, I confess; for, certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction. But I will no longer importune my young
cousin.”
Then turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at
backgammon. Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he
acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements.
Mrs. Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia's interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would
resume his book; but Mr. Collins, after assuring them that he bore his
young cousin no ill-will, and should never resent her behaviour as any
affront, seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared
48
for backgammon.
Chapter 15
Mr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature
had been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part
of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and
miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he
had merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful
acquaintance. The subjection in which his father had brought him up
had given him originally great humility of manner; but it was now a
good deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity. A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine
de Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect
which he felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness, mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority
as a clergyman, and his right as a rector, made him altogether a mixture
of pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.
Having now a good house and a very sufficient income, he intended to marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn
family he had a wife in view, as he meant to choose one of the
daughters, if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were
represented by common report. This was his plan of amends—of
atonement—for inheriting their father's estate; and he thought it an
excellent one, full of eligibility and suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part.
His plan did not vary on seeing them. Miss Bennet's lovely face
confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what
was due to seniority; and for the first evening she was his settled choice.
The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter of an
hour's tete-a-tete with Mrs. Bennet before breakfast, a conversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally to the avowal
of his hopes, that a mistress might be found for it at Longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on. “As to her
younger daughters, she could not take upon her to say—she could not
positively answer—but she did not know of any prepossession; her eldest daughter, she must just mention—she felt it incumbent on her to
hint, was likely to be very soon engaged.”
49
Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth—and it was
soon done—done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire. Elizabeth,
equally next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.
Mrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon
have two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to
speak of the day before was now high in her good graces.
Lydia's intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every
sister except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to attend them, at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to
get rid of him, and have his library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins
had followed him after breakfast; and there he would continue, nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection, but really
talking to Mr. Bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at
Hunsford. Such doings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly. In his
library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though
prepared, as he told Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every
other room of the house, he was used to be free from them there; his
civility, therefore, was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his
daughters in their walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader, was extremely pleased to close his large
book, and go.
In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his
cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton. The attention
of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him. Their
eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers, and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new
muslin in a shop window, could recall them.
But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man,
whom they had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance,
walking with another officer on the other side of the way. The officer
was the very Mr. Denny concerning whose return from London Lydia
came to inquire, and he bowed as they passed. All were struck with
the stranger's air, all wondered who he could be; and Kitty and Lydia, determined if possible to find out, led the way across the street,
under pretense of wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen, turning
back, had reached the same spot. Mr. Denny addressed them directly,
and entreated permission to introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who
had returned with him the day before from town, and he was happy
to say had accepted a commission in their corps. This was exactly as
it should be; for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him
50
completely charming. His appearance was greatly in his favour; he had
all the best part of beauty, a fine countenance, a good figure, and very
pleasing address. The introduction was followed up on his side by
a happy readiness of conversation—a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the whole party were still standing
and talking together very agreeably, when the sound of horses drew
their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were seen riding down the street.
On distinguishing the ladies of the group, the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual civilities. Bingley was the
principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the principal object. He was
then, he said, on his way to Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her.
Mr. Darcy corroborated it with a bow, and was beginning to determine
not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by
the sight of the stranger, and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other, was all astonishment at the
effect of the meeting. Both changed colour, one looked white, the other
red. Mr. Wickham, after a few moments, touched his hat—a salutation
which Mr. Darcy just deigned to return. What could be the meaning of
it? It was impossible to imagine; it was impossible not to long to know.
In another minute, Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.
Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the
door of Mr. Phillip's house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss
Lydia's pressing entreaties that they should come in, and even in spite
of Mrs. Phillips's throwing up the parlour window and loudly seconding the invitation.
Mrs. Phillips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two eldest,
from their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as
their own carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if she had not happened to see Mr. Jones's shop-boy in the
street, who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts
to Netherfield because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her
civility was claimed towards Mr. Collins by Jane's introduction of him.
She received him with her very best politeness, which he returned with
as much more, apologising for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with her, which he could not help flattering himself, however, might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who
introduced him to her notice. Mrs. Phillips was quite awed by such
an excess of good breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was
soon put to an end by exclamations and inquiries about the other; of
51
whom, however, she could only tell her nieces what they already knew,
that Mr. Denny had brought him from London, and that he was to have
a lieutenant's commission in the ——shire. She had been watching him
the last hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street, and had
Mr. Wickham appeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation, but unluckily no one passed windows now except
a few of the officers, who, in comparison with the stranger, were become “stupid, disagreeable fellows.” Some of them were to dine with
the Phillipses the next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr. Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn would come in the evening. This was agreed to,
and Mrs. Phillips protested that they would have a nice comfortable
noisy game of lottery tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards.
The prospect of such delights was very cheering, and they parted in
mutual good spirits. Mr. Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the
room, and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless.
As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen
pass between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either or both, had they appeared to be in the wrong, she could
no more explain such behaviour than her sister.
Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring
Mrs. Phillips's manners and politeness. He protested that, except Lady
Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman;
for she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but even
pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although
utterly unknown to her before. Something, he supposed, might be attributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so
much attention in the whole course of his life.
Chapter 16
As no objection was made to the young people's engagement with
their aunt, and all Mr. Collins's scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet
for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the
coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton;
and the girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawingroom, that Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation, and was
then in the house.
When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats,
52
Mr. Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was
so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he
declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer
breakfast parlour at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey
much gratification; but when Mrs. Phillips understood from him what
Rosings was, and who was its proprietor—when she had listened to
the description of only one of Lady Catherine's drawing-rooms, and
found that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds,
she felt all the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper's room.
In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her
mansion, with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble
abode, and the improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs. Phillips
a very attentive listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased
with what she heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her
neighbours as soon as she could. To the girls, who could not listen to
their cousin, and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the
mantelpiece, the interval of waiting appeared very long. It was over at
last, however. The gentlemen did approach, and when Mr. Wickham
walked into the room, Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing
him before, nor thinking of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration. The officers of the ——shire were in general
a very creditable, gentlemanlike set, and the best of them were of the
present party; but Mr. Wickham was as far beyond them all in person,
countenance, air, and walk, as they were superior to the broad-faced,
stuffy uncle Phillips, breathing port wine, who followed them into the
room.
Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom
he finally seated himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation, though it was only on its being a wet
night, made her feel that the commonest, dullest, most threadbare topic
might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker.
With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and the
officers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to the young
ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Mrs. Phillips, and was by her watchfulness, most abundantly
supplied with coffee and muffin. When the card-tables were placed, he
had the opportunity of obliging her in turn, by sitting down to whist.
53
“I know little of the game at present,” said he, “but I shall be glad
to improve myself, for in my situation in life—” Mrs. Phillips was very
glad for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.
Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he
received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia. At first there
seemed danger of Lydia's engrossing him entirely, for she was a most
determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets,
she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making
bets and exclaiming after prizes to have attention for anyone in particular. Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham
was therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing
to hear him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not
hope to be told—the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She
dared not even mention that gentleman. Her curiosity, however, was
unexpectedly relieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself. He
inquired how far Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving
her answer, asked in a hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been
staying there.
“About a month,” said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject drop, added, “He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I
understand.”
“Yes,” replied Mr. Wickham; “his estate there is a noble one. A clear
ten thousand per annum. You could not have met with a person more
capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself, for
I have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my
infancy.”
Elizabeth could not but look surprised.
“You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after
seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting
yesterday. Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?”
“As much as I ever wish to be,” cried Elizabeth very warmly. “I
have spent four days in the same house with him, and I think him very
disagreeable.”
“I have no right to give my opinion,” said Wickham, “as to his being
agreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I have known
him too long and too well to be a fair judge. It is impossible for me
to be impartial. But I believe your opinion of him would in general
astonish—and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else. Here you are in your own family.”
“Upon my word, I say no more here than I might say in any house
in the neighbourhood, except Netherfield. He is not at all liked in Hert54
fordshire. Everybody is disgusted with his pride. You will not find him
more favourably spoken of by anyone.”
“I cannot pretend to be sorry,” said Wickham, after a short interruption, “that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their
deserts; but with him I believe it does not often happen. The world is
blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his high and
imposing manners, and sees him only as he chooses to be seen.”
“I should take him, even on my slight acquaintance, to be an illtempered man.” Wickham only shook his head.
“I wonder,” said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, “whether
he is likely to be in this country much longer.”
“I do not at all know; but I heard nothing of his going away when
I was at Netherfield. I hope your plans in favour of the ——shire will
not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.”
“Oh! no—it is not for me to be driven away by Mr. Darcy. If he
wishes to avoid seeing me, he must go. We are not on friendly terms,
and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for
avoiding him but what I might proclaim before all the world, a sense
of very great ill-usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he
is. His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best
men that ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can
never be in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the
soul by a thousand tender recollections. His behaviour to myself has
been scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and
everything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the
memory of his father.”
Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened
with all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.
Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the
neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he
had yet seen, and speaking of the latter with gentle but very intelligible
gallantry.
“It was the prospect of constant society, and good society,” he
added, “which was my chief inducement to enter the ——shire. I
knew it to be a most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend Denny
tempted me further by his account of their present quarters, and the
very great attentions and excellent acquaintances Meryton had procured them. Society, I own, is necessary to me. I have been a disappointed man, and my spirits will not bear solitude. I must have employment and society. A military life is not what I was intended for,
but circumstances have now made it eligible. The church ought to have
55
been my profession—I was brought up for the church, and I should
at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living, had it
pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now.”
“Indeed!”
“Yes—the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of
the best living in his gift. He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me. I cannot do justice to his kindness. He meant to provide
for me amply, and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it
was given elsewhere.”
“Good heavens!” cried Elizabeth; “but how could that be? How
could his will be disregarded? Why did you not seek legal redress?”
“There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to
give me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have doubted
the intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it—or to treat it as a merely
conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim
to it by extravagance, imprudence—in short anything or nothing. Certain it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I was
of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no less
certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done anything
to deserve to lose it. I have a warm, unguarded temper, and I may have
spoken my opinion of him, and to him, too freely. I can recall nothing
worse. But the fact is, that we are very different sort of men, and that
he hates me.”
“This is quite shocking! He deserves to be publicly disgraced.”
“Some time or other he will be—but it shall not be by me. Till I can
forget his father, I can never defy or expose him.”
Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them.
“But what,” said she, after a pause, “can have been his motive?
What can have induced him to behave so cruelly?”
“A thorough, determined dislike of me—a dislike which I cannot
but attribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late Mr. Darcy liked
me less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father's uncommon attachment to me irritated him, I believe, very early in life. He
had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood—
the sort of preference which was often given me.”
“I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this—though I have never
liked him. I had not thought so very ill of him. I had supposed him to
be despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of
descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity
as this.”
56
After a few minutes' reflection, however, she continued, “I do remember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of
his resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper. His disposition
must be dreadful.”
“I will not trust myself on the subject,” replied Wickham; “I can
hardly be just to him.”
Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed,
“To treat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of his
father!” She could have added, “A young man, too, like you, whose
very countenance may vouch for your being amiable”—but she contented herself with, “and one, too, who had probably been his companion from childhood, connected together, as I think you said, in the
closest manner!”
“We were born in the same parish, within the same park; the greatest part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house,
sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care. My
father began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Phillips, appears to do so much credit to—but he gave up everything to be of use
to the late Mr. Darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property. He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most intimate, confidential friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to be
under the greatest obligations to my father's active superintendence,
and when, immediately before my father's death, Mr. Darcy gave him
a voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it
to be as much a debt of gratitude to him, as of his affection to myself.”
“How strange!” cried Elizabeth. “How abominable! I wonder that
the very pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you! If
from no better motive, that he should not have been too proud to be
dishonest—for dishonesty I must call it.”
“It is wonderful,” replied Wickham, “for almost all his actions may
be traced to pride; and pride had often been his best friend. It has connected him nearer with virtue than with any other feeling. But we are
none of us consistent, and in his behaviour to me there were stronger
impulses even than pride.”
“Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?”
“Yes. It has often led him to be liberal and generous, to give his
money freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve
the poor. Family pride, and filial pride—for he is very proud of what
his father was—have done this. Not to appear to disgrace his family,
to degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the
Pemberley House, is a powerful motive. He has also brotherly pride,
57
which, with some brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister, and you will hear him generally cried up as
the most attentive and best of brothers.”
“What sort of girl is Miss Darcy?”
He shook his head. “I wish I could call her amiable. It gives me pain
to speak ill of a Darcy. But she is too much like her brother—very, very
proud. As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely
fond of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement.
But she is nothing to me now. She is a handsome girl, about fifteen
or sixteen, and, I understand, highly accomplished. Since her father's
death, her home has been London, where a lady lives with her, and
superintends her education.”
After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth
could not help reverting once more to the first, and saying:
“I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley! How can Mr.
Bingley, who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly
amiable, be in friendship with such a man? How can they suit each
other? Do you know Mr. Bingley?”
“Not at all.”
“He is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man. He cannot know
what Mr. Darcy is.”
“Probably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses. He does
not want abilities. He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it
worth his while. Among those who are at all his equals in consequence,
he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous. His
pride never deserts him; but with the rich he is liberal-minded, just,
sincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable—allowing something for fortune and figure.”
The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round the other table and Mr. Collins took his station between
his cousin Elizabeth and Mrs. Phillips. The usual inquiries as to his
success was made by the latter. It had not been very great; he had
lost every point; but when Mrs. Phillips began to express her concern
thereupon, he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not
of the least importance, that he considered the money as a mere trifle,
and begged that she would not make herself uneasy.
“I know very well, madam,” said he, “that when persons sit down
to a card-table, they must take their chances of these things, and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object.
There are undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks
to Lady Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity
58
of regarding little matters.”
Mr. Wickham's attention was caught; and after observing Mr.
Collins for a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice
whether her relation was very intimately acquainted with the family
of de Bourgh.
“Lady Catherine de Bourgh,” she replied, “has very lately given
him a living. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to
her notice, but he certainly has not known her long.”
“You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady
Anne Darcy were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present
Mr. Darcy.”
“No, indeed, I did not. I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine's
connections. I never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday.”
“Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and
it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates.”
This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss
Bingley. Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her
affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already selfdestined for another.
“Mr. Collins,” said she, “speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and
her daughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship, I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her
being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman.”
“I believe her to be both in a great degree,” replied Wickham; “I
have not seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I
never liked her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent.
She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I
rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride
for her nephew, who chooses that everyone connected with him should
have an understanding of the first class.”
Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it,
and they continued talking together, with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their share of
Mr. Wickham's attentions. There could be no conversation in the noise
of Mrs. Phillips's supper party, but his manners recommended him to
everybody. Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did,
done gracefully. Elizabeth went away with her head full of him. She
could think of nothing but of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told
her, all the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention
59
his name as they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once
silent. Lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had
lost and the fish she had won; and Mr. Collins in describing the civility of Mr. and Mrs. Phillips, protesting that he did not in the least
regard his losses at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing that he crowded his cousins, had more to say than he
could well manage before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House.
Chapter 17
Elizabeth related to Jane the next day what had passed between Mr.
Wickham and herself. Jane listened with astonishment and concern;
she knew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy
of Mr. Bingley's regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question
the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham.
The possibility of his having endured such unkindness, was enough to
interest all her tender feelings; and nothing remained therefore to be
done, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each,
and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not
be otherwise explained.
“They have both,” said she, “been deceived, I dare say, in some
way or other, of which we can form no idea. Interested people have
perhaps misrepresented each to the other. It is, in short, impossible for
us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated
them, without actual blame on either side.”
“Very true, indeed; and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to
say on behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business? Do clear them too, or we shall be obliged to
think ill of somebody.”
“Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of
my opinion. My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful
light it places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father's favourite in such a
manner, one whom his father had promised to provide for. It is impossible. No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for
his character, could be capable of it. Can his most intimate friends be
so excessively deceived in him? Oh! no.”
“I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley's being imposed on,
than that Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he
gave me last night; names, facts, everything mentioned without ceremony. If it be not so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it. Besides, there was
60
truth in his looks.”
“It is difficult indeed—it is distressing. One does not know what to
think.”
“I beg your pardon; one knows exactly what to think.”
But Jane could think with certainty on only one point—that Mr.
Bingley, if he had been imposed on, would have much to suffer when
the affair became public.
The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where
this conversation passed, by the arrival of the very persons of whom
they had been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their
personal invitation for the long-expected ball at Netherfield, which
was fixed for the following Tuesday. The two ladies were delighted
to see their dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and
repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation. To the rest of the family they paid little attention; avoiding
Mrs. Bennet as much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth, and
nothing at all to the others. They were soon gone again, rising from
their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and
hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs. Bennet's civilities.
The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to
every female of the family. Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given
in compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered
by receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a ceremonious card. Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society
of her two friends, and the attentions of her brother; and Elizabeth
thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr. Wickham, and
of seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy's look and behavior. The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended less
on any single event, or any particular person, for though they each,
like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham, he
was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball
was, at any rate, a ball. And even Mary could assure her family that
she had no disinclination for it.
“While I can have my mornings to myself,” said she, “it is enough—
I think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.
Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those who
consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for everybody.”
Elizabeth's spirits were so high on this occasion, that though she
did not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not help
asking him whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley's invitation, and
61
if he did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening's
amusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained
no scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a
rebuke either from the Archbishop, or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by
venturing to dance.
“I am by no means of the opinion, I assure you,” said he, “that a
ball of this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable
people, can have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to
dancing myself, that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all
my fair cousins in the course of the evening; and I take this opportunity
of soliciting yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially, a
preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause,
and not to any disrespect for her.”
Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in. She had fully proposed
being engaged by Mr. Wickham for those very dances; and to have Mr.
Collins instead! her liveliness had never been worse timed. There was
no help for it, however. Mr. Wickham's happiness and her own were
perforce delayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins's proposal accepted
with as good a grace as she could. She was not the better pleased with
his gallantry from the idea it suggested of something more. It now
first struck her, that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy
of being mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a
quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors. The
idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on
her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms, it was not long before her mother gave
her to understand that the probability of their marriage was extremely
agreeable to her. Elizabeth, however, did not choose to take the hint,
being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of
any reply. Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and till he did, it
was useless to quarrel about him.
If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the
younger Miss Bennets would have been in a very pitiable state at this
time, for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there was
such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once.
No aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after—the very shoeroses for Netherfield were got by proxy. Even Elizabeth might have
found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended
the improvement of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing
less than a dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday,
62
Sunday, and Monday endurable to Kitty and Lydia.
Chapter 18
Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and looked
in vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her. The certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her. She had dressed
with more than usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the
conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it
was not more than might be won in the course of the evening. But in
an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted
for Mr. Darcy's pleasure in the Bingleys' invitation to the officers; and
though this was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence
was pronounced by his friend Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied,
and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on
business the day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant smile, “I do not imagine his business would have called him
away just now, if he had not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman here.”
This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught
by Elizabeth, and, as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable
for Wickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just, every
feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached
to make. Attendance, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury
to Wickham. She was resolved against any sort of conversation with
him, and turned away with a degree of ill-humour which she could
not wholly surmount even in speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind
partiality provoked her.
But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every
prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell
long on her spirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas,
whom she had not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to
her particular notice. The first two dances, however, brought a return
of distress; they were dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward
and solemn, apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong
without being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a
63
disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give. The moment of
her release from him was ecstasy.
She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked. When
those dances were over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in
conversation with her, when she found herself suddenly addressed
by Mr. Darcy who took her so much by surprise in his application for
her hand, that, without knowing what she did, she accepted him. He
walked away again immediately, and she was left to fret over her own
want of presence of mind; Charlotte tried to console her:
“I dare say you will find him very agreeable.”
“Heaven forbid! That would be the greatest misfortune of all! To
find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate! Do not wish
me such an evil.”
When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached
to claim her hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper,
not to be a simpleton, and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her
appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man ten times his consequence. Elizabeth made no answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr.
Darcy, and reading in her neighbours' looks, their equal amazement in
beholding it. They stood for some time without speaking a word; and
she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two
dances, and at first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying
that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to
talk, she made some slight observation on the dance. He replied, and
was again silent. After a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a
second time with:—“It is your turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy. I
talked about the dance, and you ought to make some sort of remark on
the size of the room, or the number of couples.”
He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say
should be said.
“Very well. That reply will do for the present. Perhaps by and by
I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones.
But now we may be silent.”
“Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?”
“Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd
to be entirely silent for half an hour together; and yet for the advantage
of some, conversation ought to be so arranged, as that they may have
the trouble of saying as little as possible.”
“Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do
64
you imagine that you are gratifying mine?”
“Both,” replied Elizabeth archly; “for I have always seen a great
similarity in the turn of our minds. We are each of an unsocial, taciturn
disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say something that
will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to posterity with all
the eclat of a proverb.”
“This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am
sure,” said he. “How near it may be to mine, I cannot pretend to say.
You think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly.”
“I must not decide on my own performance.”
He made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone
down the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very
often walk to Meryton. She answered in the affirmative, and, unable
to resist the temptation, added, “When you met us there the other day,
we had just been forming a new acquaintance.”
The effect was immediate. A deeper shade of hauteur overspread
his features, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though blaming
herself for her own weakness, could not go on. At length Darcy spoke,
and in a constrained manner said, “Mr. Wickham is blessed with such
happy manners as may ensure his making friends—whether he may be
equally capable of retaining them, is less certain.”
“He has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship,” replied Elizabeth with emphasis, “and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from
all his life.”
Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject. At that moment, Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr. Darcy, he stopped with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner.
“I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear sir. Such very
superior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong to the
first circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not
disgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,
especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Eliza (glancing at
her sister and Bingley) shall take place. What congratulations will then
flow in! I appeal to Mr. Darcy:—but let me not interrupt you, sir. You
will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of
that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.”
The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but
Sir William's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and
his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley
65
and Jane, who were dancing together. Recovering himself, however,
shortly, he turned to his partner, and said, “Sir William's interruption
has made me forget what we were talking of.”
“I do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not have
interrupted two people in the room who had less to say for themselves.
We have tried two or three subjects already without success, and what
we are to talk of next I cannot imagine.”
“What think you of books?” said he, smiling.
“Books—oh! no. I am sure we never read the same, or not with the
same feelings.”
“I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be
no want of subject. We may compare our different opinions.”
“No—I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full
of something else.”
“The present always occupies you in such scenes—does it?” said he,
with a look of doubt.
“Yes, always,” she replied, without knowing what she said, for her
thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming, “I remember hearing you once say,
Mr. Darcy, that you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was unappeasable. You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its being
created.”
“I am,” said he, with a firm voice.
“And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?”
“I hope not.”
“It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion, to be secure of judging properly at first.”
“May I ask to what these questions tend?”
“Merely to the illustration of your character,” said she, endeavouring to shake off her gravity. “I am trying to make it out.”
“And what is your success?”
She shook her head. “I do not get on at all. I hear such different
accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.”
“I can readily believe,” answered he gravely, “that reports may vary
greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you
were not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either.”
“But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another
opportunity.”
“I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,” he coldly
replied. She said no more, and they went down the other dance and
66
parted in silence; and on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal
degree, for in Darcy's breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her, which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger
against another.
They had not long separated, when Miss Bingley came towards her,
and with an expression of civil disdain accosted her:
“So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham! Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a
thousand questions; and I find that the young man quite forgot to tell
you, among his other communication, that he was the son of old Wickham, the late Mr. Darcy's steward. Let me recommend you, however,
as a friend, not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as
to Mr. Darcy's using him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary,
he has always been remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham
has treated Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner. I do not know the
particulars, but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to
blame, that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned, and
that though my brother thought that he could not well avoid including
him in his invitation to the officers, he was excessively glad to find that
he had taken himself out of the way. His coming into the country at all
is a most insolent thing, indeed, and I wonder how he could presume
to do it. I pity you, Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite's
guilt; but really, considering his descent, one could not expect much
better.”
“His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same,”
said Elizabeth angrily; “for I have heard you accuse him of nothing
worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy's steward, and of that, I can
assure you, he informed me himself.”
“I beg your pardon,” replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a
sneer. “Excuse my interference—it was kindly meant.”
“Insolent girl!” said Elizabeth to herself. “You are much mistaken if
you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this. I see nothing
in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr. Darcy.” She
then sought her eldest sister, who has undertaken to make inquiries on
the same subject of Bingley. Jane met her with a smile of such sweet
complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently marked
how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening. Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for
Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and everything else, gave
way before the hope of Jane's being in the fairest way for happiness.
“I want to know,” said she, with a countenance no less smiling than
67
her sister's, “what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But perhaps
you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in
which case you may be sure of my pardon.”
“No,” replied Jane, “I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing
satisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his
history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct, the
probity, and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that Mr.
Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has
received; and I am sorry to say by his account as well as his sister's, Mr.
Wickham is by no means a respectable young man. I am afraid he has
been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy's regard.”
“Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?”
“No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.”
“This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am
satisfied. But what does he say of the living?”
“He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has
heard them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was
left to him conditionally only.”
“I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley's sincerity,” said Elizabeth
warmly; “but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances
only. Mr. Bingley's defense of his friend was a very able one, I dare
say; but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and
has learnt the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture to still think
of both gentlemen as I did before.”
She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and
on which there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth listened
with delight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Mr. Bingley's regard, and said all in her power to heighten
her confidence in it. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness
of her last partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came
up to them, and told her with great exultation that he had just been so
fortunate as to make a most important discovery.
“I have found out,” said he, “by a singular accident, that there is
now in the room a near relation of my patroness. I happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the
honours of the house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of
her mother Lady Catherine. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would have thought of my meeting with, perhaps, a nephew
of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly! I am most thankful that
68
the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him, which
I am now going to do, and trust he will excuse my not having done it
before. My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology.”
“You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy!”
“Indeed I am. I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier. I believe him to be Lady Catherine's nephew. It will be in my power
to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'nnight.”
Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme, assuring
him that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his
aunt; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice
on either side; and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in consequence, to begin the acquaintance. Mr. Collins listened
to her with the determined air of following his own inclination, and,
when she ceased speaking, replied thus:
“My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world in
your excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of your understanding; but permit me to say, that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those
which regulate the clergy; for, give me leave to observe that I consider
the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in
the kingdom—provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the
same time maintained. You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to perform
what I look on as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to profit by
your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide,
though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education
and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like
yourself.” And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr. Darcy, whose
reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident. Her cousin prefaced his
speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of it,
she felt as if hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words
“apology,” “Hunsford,” and “Lady Catherine de Bourgh.” It vexed
her to see him expose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing
him with unrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed
him time to speak, replied with an air of distant civility. Mr. Collins,
however, was not discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy's
contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second
speech, and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved
another way. Mr. Collins then returned to Elizabeth.
69
“I have no reason, I assure you,” said he, “to be dissatisfied with
my reception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. He
answered me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine's discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily.
It was really a very handsome thought. Upon the whole, I am much
pleased with him.”
As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she
turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley; and
the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to,
made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane. She saw her in idea settled
in that very house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection
could bestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of endeavouring even to like Bingley's two sisters. Her mother's thoughts
she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to
venture near her, lest she might hear too much. When they sat down to
supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which
placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to
find that her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely,
openly, and of nothing else but her expectation that Jane would soon be
married to Mr. Bingley. It was an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet
seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the
match. His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living
but three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and
then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of
Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as
she could do. It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger
daughters, as Jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way
of other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to
be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that
she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. It
was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because
on such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than
Mrs. Bennet to find comfort in staying home at any period of her life.
She concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be
equally fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there
was no chance of it.
In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her
mother's words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper; for, to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive
that the chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to
70
them. Her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.
“What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I
am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say
nothing he may not like to hear.”
“For heaven's sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage can it
be for you to offend Mr. Darcy? You will never recommend yourself to
his friend by so doing!”
Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her
mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone. Elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation. She could
not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance
convinced her of what she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was convinced that his attention was invariably
fixed by her. The expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity.
At length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she
saw no likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and
chicken. Elizabeth now began to revive. But not long was the interval of tranquillity; for, when supper was over, singing was talked of,
and she had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,
preparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks and silent
entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance,
but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of
exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song. Elizabeth's
eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations, and she watched
her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which
was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving, amongst
the thanks of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed
on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute began another. Mary's powers were by no means fitted for such a display; her
voice was weak, and her manner affected. Elizabeth was in agonies.
She looked at Jane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly talking to Bingley. She looked at his two sisters, and saw them
making signs of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued,
however, imperturbably grave. She looked at her father to entreat his
interference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He took the hint,
and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud, “That will
do extremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough. Let the
other young ladies have time to exhibit.”
Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted;
71
and Elizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her father's speech, was
afraid her anxiety had done no good. Others of the party were now
applied to.
“If I,” said Mr. Collins, “were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I
should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with
an air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly
compatible with the profession of a clergyman. I do not mean, however, to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time
to music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. The rector of a parish has much to do. In the first place, he must make such
an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and the time that
remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care and
improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible. And I do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manner towards
everybody, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment.
I cannot acquit him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who
should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the family.” And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded his
speech, which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room.
Many stared—many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr.
Bennet himself, while his wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for
having spoken so sensibly, and observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man.
To Elizabeth it appeared that, had her family made an agreement
to expose themselves as much as a they could during the evening, it
would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more
spirit or finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her
sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his
feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which
he must have witnessed. That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however,
should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations, was bad
enough, and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of
the gentleman, or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.
The rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was
teased by Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side,
and though he could not prevail on her to dance with him again, put it
out of her power to dance with others. In vain did she entreat him to
stand up with somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young
72
lady in the room. He assured her, that as to dancing, he was perfectly
indifferent to it; that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her and that he should therefore make a point of
remaining close to her the whole evening. There was no arguing upon
such a project. She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas,
who often joined them, and good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins's conversation to herself.
She was at least free from the offense of Mr. Darcy's further notice;
though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite disengaged, he never came near enough to speak. She felt it to be the
probable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in
it.
The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart,
and, by a manoeuvre of Mrs. Bennet, had to wait for their carriage a
quarter of an hour after everybody else was gone, which gave them
time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths, except to
complain of fatigue, and were evidently impatient to have the house
to themselves. They repulsed every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing threw a languor over the whole party, which
was very little relieved by the long speeches of Mr. Collins, who was
complimenting Mr. Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their
entertainment, and the hospitality and politeness which had marked
their behaviour to their guests. Darcy said nothing at all. Mr. Bennet,
in equal silence, was enjoying the scene. Mr. Bingley and Jane were
standing together, a little detached from the rest, and talked only to
each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs. Hurst
or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more
than the occasional exclamation of “Lord, how tired I am!” accompanied by a violent yawn.
When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most
pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn, and addressed herself especially to Mr. Bingley, to assure him
how happy he would make them by eating a family dinner with them
at any time, without the ceremony of a formal invitation. Bingley was
all grateful pleasure, and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her, after his return from London, whither he
was obliged to go the next day for a short time.
Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied, and quitted the house under
the delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations
of settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should un73
doubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three
or four months. Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins,
she thought with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not
equal, pleasure. Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children;
and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her,
the worth of each was eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.
Chapter 19
The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr. Collins made
his declaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of time,
as his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and
having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even
at the moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the
observances, which he supposed a regular part of the business. On
finding Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together,
soon after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words:
“May I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth, when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in
the course of this morning?”
Before Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise, Mrs.
Bennet answered instantly, “Oh dear!—yes—certainly. I am sure Lizzy
will be very happy—I am sure she can have no objection. Come, Kitty,
I want you upstairs.” And, gathering her work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth called out:
“Dear madam, do not go. I beg you will not go. Mr. Collins must
excuse me. He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not
hear. I am going away myself.”
“No, no, nonsense, Lizzy. I desire you to stay where you are.” And
upon Elizabeth's seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks,
about to escape, she added: “Lizzy, I insist upon your staying and hearing Mr. Collins.”
Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction—and a moment's
consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it
over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again and tried
to conceal, by incessant employment the feelings which were divided
between distress and diversion. Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and
as soon as they were gone, Mr. Collins began.
“Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from
doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections. You
74
would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little
unwillingness; but allow me to assure you, that I have your respected
mother's permission for this address. You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to
dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as soon as I entered the house, I singled you out as the companion of my future life. But before I am run away with by my feelings on
this subject, perhaps it would be advisable for me to state my reasons
for marrying—and, moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the
design of selecting a wife, as I certainly did.”
The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run
away with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing, that she
could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him
further, and he continued:
“My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for
every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example of matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am convinced that it
will add very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly—which perhaps
I ought to have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and
recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of
calling patroness. Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion
(unasked too!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night
before I left Hunsford—between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs.
Jenkinson was arranging Miss de Bourgh's footstool, that she said, ‘Mr.
Collins, you must marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose
properly, choose a gentlewoman for my sake; and for your own, let her
be an active, useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to
make a small income go a good way. This is my advice. Find such
a woman as soon as you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit
her.' Allow me, by the way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not
reckon the notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among
the least of the advantages in my power to offer. You will find her
manners beyond anything I can describe; and your wit and vivacity,
I think, must be acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the
silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much
for my general intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told
why my views were directed towards Longbourn instead of my own
neighbourhood, where I can assure you there are many amiable young
women. But the fact is, that being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father (who, however, may live many
years longer), I could not satisfy myself without resolving to choose a
75
wife from among his daughters, that the loss to them might be as little
as possible, when the melancholy event takes place—which, however,
as I have already said, may not be for several years. This has been my
motive, my fair cousin, and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your
esteem. And now nothing remains but for me but to assure you in the
most animated language of the violence of my affection. To fortune I
am perfectly indifferent, and shall make no demand of that nature on
your father, since I am well aware that it could not be complied with;
and that one thousand pounds in the four per cents, which will not be
yours till after your mother's decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On that head, therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you
may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my
lips when we are married.”
It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.
“You are too hasty, sir,” she cried. “You forget that I have made no
answer. Let me do it without further loss of time. Accept my thanks for
the compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible of the honour
of your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than to
decline them.”
“I am not now to learn,” replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave
of the hand, “that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses
of the man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies
for their favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second,
or even a third time. I am therefore by no means discouraged by what
you have just said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.”
“Upon my word, sir,” cried Elizabeth, “your hope is a rather extraordinary one after my declaration. I do assure you that I am not one of
those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so daring
as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time.
I am perfectly serious in my refusal. You could not make me happy,
and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who could
make you so. Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I
am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the
situation.”
“Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,” said Mr.
Collins very gravely—“but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would
at all disapprove of you. And you may be certain when I have the honour of seeing her again, I shall speak in the very highest terms of your
modesty, economy, and other amiable qualification.”
“Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You must
give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of be76
lieving what I say. I wish you very happy and very rich, and by refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise. In
making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn
estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach. This matter may be
considered, therefore, as finally settled.” And rising as she thus spoke,
she would have quitted the room, had Mr. Collins not thus addressed
her:
“When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject, I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have
now given me; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present,
because I know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a
man on the first application, and perhaps you have even now said as
much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character.”
“Really, Mr. Collins,” cried Elizabeth with some warmth, “you puzzle me exceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in
the form of encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in
such a way as to convince you of its being one.”
“You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your
refusal of my addresses is merely words of course. My reasons for believing it are briefly these: It does not appear to me that my hand is
unworthy your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would
be any other than highly desirable. My situation in life, my connections with the family of de Bourgh, and my relationship to your own,
are circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into
further consideration, that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by
no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you.
Your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the
effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I shall
choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense,
according to the usual practice of elegant females.”
“I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to that
kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man. I
would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere. I thank
you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but to accept them is absolutely impossible. My feelings in every
respect forbid it. Can I speak plainer? Do not consider me now as
an elegant female, intending to plague you, but as a rational creature,
speaking the truth from her heart.”
77
“You are uniformly charming!” cried he, with an air of awkward
gallantry; “and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express
authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of
being acceptable.”
To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would
make no reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined,
if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered in
such a manner as to be decisive, and whose behavior at least could not
be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.
Chapter 20
Mr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule
to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open
the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she
entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself
in warm terms on the happy prospect or their nearer connection. Mr.
Collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure,
and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the
result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since
the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her
character.
This information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet; she would have
been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not believe it, and could not help saying so.
“But, depend upon it, Mr. Collins,” she added, “that Lizzy shall be
brought to reason. I will speak to her about it directly. She is a very
headstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her own interest but I will
make her know it.”
“Pardon me for interrupting you, madam,” cried Mr. Collins; “but
if she is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would
altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state. If therefore she actually
persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to force her into
accepting me, because if liable to such defects of temper, she could not
contribute much to my felicity.”
78
“Sir, you quite misunderstand me,” said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed.
“Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these. In everything else
she is as good-natured a girl as ever lived. I will go directly to Mr.
Bennet, and we shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure.”
She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her
husband, called out as she entered the library, “Oh! Mr. Bennet, you
are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar. You must come and
make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will not have him, and
if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her.”
Mr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed
them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least
altered by her communication.
“I have not the pleasure of understanding you,” said he, when she
had finished her speech. “Of what are you talking?”
“Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not have Mr.
Collins, and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy.”
“And what am I to do on the occasion? It seems an hopeless business.”
“Speak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist upon her
marrying him.”
“Let her be called down. She shall hear my opinion.”
Mrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to
the library.
“Come here, child,” cried her father as she appeared. “I have sent
for you on an affair of importance. I understand that Mr. Collins has
made you an offer of marriage. Is it true?” Elizabeth replied that it
was. “Very well—and this offer of marriage you have refused?”
“I have, sir.”
“Very well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon
your accepting it. Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?”
“Yes, or I will never see her again.”
“An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day
you must be a stranger to one of your parents. Your mother will never
see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you
again if you do.”
Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning, but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband
regarded the affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.
“What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, in talking this way? You promised
me to insist upon her marrying him.”
79
“My dear,” replied her husband, “I have two small favours to request. First, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding
on the present occasion; and secondly, of my room. I shall be glad to
have the library to myself as soon as may be.”
Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband,
did Mrs. Bennet give up the point. She talked to Elizabeth again and
again; coaxed and threatened her by turns. She endeavoured to secure
Jane in her interest; but Jane, with all possible mildness, declined interfering; and Elizabeth, sometimes with real earnestness, and sometimes
with playful gaiety, replied to her attacks. Though her manner varied,
however, her determination never did.
Mr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had
passed. He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motives his cousin could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he
suffered in no other way. His regard for her was quite imaginary; and
the possibility of her deserving her mother's reproach prevented his
feeling any regret.
While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to
spend the day with them. She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who,
flying to her, cried in a half whisper, “I am glad you are come, for there
is such fun here! What do you think has happened this morning? Mr.
Collins has made an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him.”
Charlotte hardly had time to answer, before they were joined by
Kitty, who came to tell the same news; and no sooner had they entered
the breakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than she likewise
began on the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and
entreating her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes
of all her family. “Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas,” she added in a melancholy tone, “for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me. I
am cruelly used, nobody feels for my poor nerves.”
Charlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth.
“Aye, there she comes,” continued Mrs. Bennet, “looking as unconcerned as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York,
provided she can have her own way. But I tell you, Miss Lizzy—if you
take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this
way, you will never get a husband at all—and I am sure I do not know
who is to maintain you when your father is dead. I shall not be able
to keep you—and so I warn you. I have done with you from this very
day. I told you in the library, you know, that I should never speak to
you again, and you will find me as good as my word. I have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children. Not that I have much pleasure,
80
indeed, in talking to anybody. People who suffer as I do from nervous
complaints can have no great inclination for talking. Nobody can tell
what I suffer! But it is always so. Those who do not complain are never
pitied.”
Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any
attempt to reason with her or soothe her would only increase the irritation. She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them,
till they were joined by Mr. Collins, who entered the room with an air
more stately than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls,
“Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and
let me and Mr. Collins have a little conversation together.”
Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed,
but Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and
Charlotte, detained first by the civility of Mr. Collins, whose inquiries
after herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little
curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending
not to hear. In a doleful voice Mrs. Bennet began the projected conversation: “Oh! Mr. Collins!”
“My dear madam,” replied he, “let us be for ever silent on this
point. Far be it from me,” he presently continued, in a voice that
marked his displeasure, “to resent the behaviour of your daughter.
Resignation to inevitable evils is the evil duty of us all; the peculiar
duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early
preferment; and I trust I am resigned. Perhaps not the less so from
feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured
me with her hand; for I have often observed that resignation is never
so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its
value in our estimation. You will not, I hope, consider me as showing
any disrespect to your family, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing
my pretensions to your daughter's favour, without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your
authority in my behalf. My conduct may, I fear, be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter's lips instead of your
own. But we are all liable to error. I have certainly meant well through
the whole affair. My object has been to secure an amiable companion
for myself, with due consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my manner has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to
apologise.”
81
Chapter 21
The discussion of Mr. Collins's offer was now nearly at an end, and
Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusions of
her mother. As for the gentleman himself, his feelings were chiefly expressed, not by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her,
but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence. He scarcely ever spoke
to her, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of
himself were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose
civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all, and especially to her friend.
The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet's ill-humour
or ill health. Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry pride.
Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but
his plan did not appear in the least affected by it. He was always to
have gone on Saturday, and to Saturday he meant to stay.
After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr. Wickham were returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball. He joined them on their entering the town, and attended
them to their aunt's where his regret and vexation, and the concern of
everybody, was well talked over. To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily
acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had been self-imposed.
“I found,” said he, “as the time drew near that I had better not meet
Mr. Darcy; that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so
many hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes
might arise unpleasant to more than myself.”
She highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a
full discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they civilly
bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back
with them to Longbourn, and during the walk he particularly attended
to her. His accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all
the compliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an
occasion of introducing him to her father and mother.
Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it
came from Netherfield. The envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little, hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady's fair, flowing hand;
and Elizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as she read it, and
saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages. Jane recollected herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to join with her
usual cheerfulness in the general conversation; but Elizabeth felt an
82
anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham; and no sooner had he and he companion taken leave, than a
glance from Jane invited her to follow her upstairs. When they had
gained their own room, Jane, taking out the letter, said:
“This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains has surprised me
a good deal. The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and
are on their way to town—and without any intention of coming back
again. You shall hear what she says.”
She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town
directly, and of their meaning to dine in Grosvenor Street, where Mr.
Hurst had a house. The next was in these words: “I do not pretend
to regret anything I shall leave in Hertfordshire, except your society,
my dearest friend; but we will hope, at some future period, to enjoy
many returns of that delightful intercourse we have known, and in
the meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent
and most unreserved correspondence. I depend on you for that.” To
these highflown expressions Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised
her, she saw nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed
that their absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley's being
there; and as to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane
must cease to regard it, in the enjoyment of his.
“It is unlucky,” said she, after a short pause, “that you should not be
able to see your friends before they leave the country. But may we not
hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks
forward may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater
satisfaction as sisters? Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by
them.”
“Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into
Hertfordshire this winter. I will read it to you:”
“When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which took him to London might be concluded in three or four
days; but as we are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when Charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it
again, we have determined on following him thither, that he may not
be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. Many of
my acquaintances are already there for the winter; I wish that I could
hear that you, my dearest friend, had any intention of making one of
the crowd—but of that I despair. I sincerely hope your Christmas in
83
Hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally
brings, and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your
feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you.”
“It is evident by this,” added Jane, “that he comes back no more
this winter.”
“It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean that he should.”
“Why will you think so? It must be his own doing. He is his own
master. But you do not know all. I will read you the passage which
particularly hurts me. I will have no reserves from you.”
“Mr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister; and, to confess the truth,
we are scarcely less eager to meet her again. I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments;
and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into
something still more interesting, from the hope we dare entertain of
her being hereafter our sister. I do not know whether I ever before
mentioned to you my feelings on this subject; but I will not leave the
country without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them
unreasonable. My brother admires her greatly already; he will have
frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing;
her relations all wish the connection as much as his own; and a sister's partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most
capable of engaging any woman's heart. With all these circumstances
to favour an attachment, and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my
dearest Jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the
happiness of so many?”
“What do you think of this sentence, my dear Lizzy?” said Jane as
she finished it. “Is it not clear enough? Does it not expressly declare
that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she
is perfectly convinced of her brother's indifference; and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!) to
put me on my guard? Can there be any other opinion on the subject?”
“Yes, there can; for mine is totally different. Will you hear it?”
“Most willingly.”
“You shall have it in a few words. Miss Bingley sees that her brother
is in love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy. She follows
him to town in hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you
that he does not care about you.”
Jane shook her head.
“Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me. No one who has ever seen
you together can doubt his affection. Miss Bingley, I am sure, cannot.
She is not such a simpleton. Could she have seen half as much love
84
in Mr. Darcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes.
But the case is this: We are not rich enough or grand enough for them;
and she is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from
the notion that when there has been one intermarriage, she may have
less trouble in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some
ingenuity, and I dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out
of the way. But, my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that
because Miss Bingley tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy,
he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he
took leave of you on Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade
him that, instead of being in love with you, he is very much in love with
her friend.”
“If we thought alike of Miss Bingley,” replied Jane, “your representation of all this might make me quite easy. But I know the foundation
is unjust. Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving anyone; and all
that I can hope in this case is that she is deceiving herself.”
“That is right. You could not have started a more happy idea, since
you will not take comfort in mine. Believe her to be deceived, by all
means. You have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer.”
“But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in
accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry
elsewhere?”
“You must decide for yourself,” said Elizabeth; “and if, upon mature deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters
is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you
by all means to refuse him.”
“How can you talk so?” said Jane, faintly smiling. “You must know
that though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I
could not hesitate.”
“I did not think you would; and that being the case, I cannot consider your situation with much compassion.”
“But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be required. A thousand things may arise in six months!”
The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt. It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline's
interested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those
wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young
man so totally independent of everyone.
She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt
on the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.
Jane's temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope,
85
though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that
Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her
heart.
They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of
the family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern, and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should
happen to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together.
After lamenting it, however, at some length, she had the consolation
that Mr. Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn, and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration, that
though he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take
care to have two full courses.
Chapter 22
The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases and again during the chief of the day was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr.
Collins. Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her. “It keeps him
in good humour,” said she, “and I am more obliged to you than I can
express.” Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time. This
was very amiable, but Charlotte's kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any conception of; its object was nothing else than to secure
her from any return of Mr. Collins's addresses, by engaging them towards herself. Such was Miss Lucas's scheme; and appearances were
so favourable, that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost secure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so
very soon. But here she did injustice to the fire and independence of
his character, for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next
morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw
himself at her feet. He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins,
from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known
till its success might be known likewise; for though feeling almost secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging,
he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday. His
reception, however, was of the most flattering kind. Miss Lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house,
and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane. But little had
86
she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.
In as short a time as Mr. Collins's long speeches would allow, everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as they
entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was
to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must
be waived for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his
happiness. The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must
guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish
for its continuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the
pure and disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon
that establishment were gained.
Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. Mr. Collins's
present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future
wealth were exceedingly fair. Lady Lucas began directly to calculate,
with more interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many
years longer Mr. Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his
decided opinion, that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of
the Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and
his wife should make their appearance at St. James's. The whole family, in short, were properly overjoyed on the occasion. The younger
girls formed hopes of coming out a year or two sooner than they might
otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte's dying an old maid. Charlotte herself was tolerably
composed. She had gained her point, and had time to consider of it.
Her reflections were in general satisfactory. Mr. Collins, to be sure,
was neither sensible nor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his
attachment to her must be imaginary. But still he would be her husband. Without thinking highly either of men or matrimony, marriage
had always been her object; it was the only provision for well-educated
young women of small fortune, and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservative from want. This preservative she had now obtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without
having ever been handsome, she felt all the good luck of it. The least
agreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she valued beyond that of
any other person. Elizabeth would wonder, and probably would blame
her; and though her resolution was not to be shaken, her feelings must
be hurt by such a disapprobation. She resolved to give her the information herself, and therefore charged Mr. Collins, when he returned to
87
Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had passed before any
of the family. A promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given,
but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the curiosity excited by
his long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on his return
as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to publish his prosperous
love.
As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any
of the family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the
ladies moved for the night; and Mrs. Bennet, with great politeness and
cordiality, said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn
again, whenever his engagements might allow him to visit them.
“My dear madam,” he replied, “this invitation is particularly gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and you may
be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as possible.”
They were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means
wish for so speedy a return, immediately said:
“But is there not danger of Lady Catherine's disapprobation here,
my good sir? You had better neglect your relations than run the risk of
offending your patroness.”
“My dear sir,” replied Mr. Collins,“ I am particularly obliged to you
for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so
material a step without her ladyship's concurrence.”
“You cannot be too much upon your guard. Risk anything rather
than her displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly
at home, and be satisfied that we shall take no offence.”
“Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such
affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive
from me a letter of thanks for this, and for every other mark of your
regard during my stay in Hertfordshire. As for my fair cousins, though
my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall now
take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting
my cousin Elizabeth.”
With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally
surprised that he meditated a quick return. Mrs. Bennet wished to
understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her
younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.
She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was
a solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no
means so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read and
88
improve himself by such an example as hers, he might become a very
agreeable companion. But on the following morning, every hope of
this kind was done away. Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in
a private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.
The possibility of Mr. Collins's fancying herself in love with her
friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; but
that Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility as she could encourage him herself, and her astonishment was
consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum,
and she could not help crying out:
“Engaged to Mr. Collins! My dear Charlotte—impossible!”
The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in
telling her story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving
so direct a reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she
soon regained her composure, and calmly replied:
“Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza? Do you think it incredible that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman's good
opinion, because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?”
But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort for it, was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the prospect
of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her
all imaginable happiness.
“I see what you are feeling,” replied Charlotte. “You must be surprised, very much surprised—so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to
marry you. But when you have had time to think it over, I hope you
will be satisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic, you know;
I never was. I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr.
Collins's character, connection, and situation in life, I am convinced
that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can
boast on entering the marriage state.”
Elizabeth quietly answered “Undoubtedly;” and after an awkward
pause, they returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not stay
much longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had
heard. It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the
idea of so unsuitable a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins's making
two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of
his being now accepted. She had always felt that Charlotte's opinion of
matrimony was not exactly like her own, but she had not supposed it
to be possible that, when called into action, she would have sacrificed
every better feeling to worldly advantage. Charlotte the wife of Mr.
Collins was a most humiliating picture! And to the pang of a friend
89
disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing
conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy
in the lot she had chosen.
Chapter 23
Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on
what she had heard, and doubting whether she was authorised to mention it, when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter,
to announce her engagement to the family. With many compliments
to them, and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses, he unfolded the matter—to an audience not merely
wondering, but incredulous; for Mrs. Bennet, with more perseverance
than politeness, protested he must be entirely mistaken; and Lydia, always unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed:
“Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story? Do not
you know that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?”
Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne
without anger such treatment; but Sir William's good breeding carried
him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the
truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the
most forbearing courtesy.
Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account,
by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and
endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which
she was readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks
on the happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent
character of Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from
London.
Mrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal
while Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her
feelings found a rapid vent. In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr.
Collins had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never
be happy together; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off.
Two inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole: one,
that Elizabeth was the real cause of the mischief; and the other that she
herself had been barbarously misused by them all; and on these two
90
points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day. Nothing could
console and nothing could appease her. Nor did that day wear out
her resentment. A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without scolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to Sir
William or Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months were
gone before she could at all forgive their daughter.
Mr. Bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion,
and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for it gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas,
whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as
his wife, and more foolish than his daughter!
Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said
less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness;
nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable. Kitty
and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only
a clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of
news to spread at Meryton.
Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married;
and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how
happy she was, though Mrs. Bennet's sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away.
Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept
them mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that
no real confidence could ever subsist between them again. Her disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister,
of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never
be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as
Bingley had now been gone a week and nothing more was heard of his
return.
Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was
counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again. The
promised letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to their father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude
which a twelvemonth's abode in the family might have prompted. After discharging his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform
them, with many rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then
explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that
he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again
at Longbourn, whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday fort91
night; for Lady Catherine, he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take place as soon as possible, which he
trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men.
Mr. Collins's return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of
pleasure to Mrs. Bennet. On the contrary, she was as much disposed to
complain of it as her husband. It was very strange that he should come
to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient
and exceedingly troublesome. She hated having visitors in the house
while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the
most disagreeable. Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and
they gave way only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley's continued
absence.
Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. Day
after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than
the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more
to Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs.
Bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous
falsehood.
Even Elizabeth began to fear—not that Bingley was indifferent—
but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away. Unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane's happiness,
and so dishonorable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent
its frequently occurring. The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss
Darcy and the amusements of London might be too much, she feared,
for the strength of his attachment.
As for Jane, her anxiety under this suspense was, of course, more
painful than Elizabeth's, but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing, and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject was
never alluded to. But as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an
hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her
impatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he did
not come back she would think herself very ill used. It needed all Jane's
steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity.
Mr. Collins returned most punctually on Monday fortnight, but his
reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his
first introduction. He was too happy, however, to need much attention;
and luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them
from a great deal of his company. The chief of every day was spent by
him at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in
92
time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.
Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. The very mention of
anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill-humour,
and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of. The sight
of Miss Lucas was odious to her. As her successor in that house, she
regarded her with jealous abhorrence. Whenever Charlotte came to
see them, she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession;
and whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced
that they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn
herself and her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr. Bennet were
dead. She complained bitterly of all this to her husband.
“Indeed, Mr. Bennet,” said she, “it is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I should be forced
to make way for her, and live to see her take her place in it!”
“My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope
for better things. Let us flatter ourselves that I may be the survivor.”
This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and therefore, instead
of making any answer, she went on as before.
“I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. If it was
not for the entail, I should not mind it.”
“What should not you mind?”
“I should not mind anything at all.”
“Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility.”
“I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about the entail.
How anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from
one's own daughters, I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr.
Collins too! Why should he have it more than anybody else?”
“I leave it to yourself to determine,” said Mr. Bennet.
Chapter 24
Miss Bingley's letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. The very first
sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for
the winter, and concluded with her brother's regret at not having had
time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left the
country.
Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the
rest of the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the
writer, that could give her any comfort. Miss Darcy's praise occupied
93
the chief of it. Her many attractions were again dwelt on, and Caroline
boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict
the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter. She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an
inmate of Mr. Darcy's house, and mentioned with raptures some plans
of the latter with regard to new furniture.
Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all
this, heard it in silent indignation. Her heart was divided between concern for her sister, and resentment against all others. To Caroline's assertion of her brother's being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no credit.
That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she had
ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him,
she could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that
easiness of temper, that want of proper resolution, which now made
him the slave of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice of his
own happiness to the caprice of their inclination. Had his own happiness, however, been the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to
sport with it in whatever manner he thought best, but her sister's was
involved in it, as she thought he must be sensible himself. It was a subject, in short, on which reflection would be long indulged, and must be
unavailing. She could think of nothing else; and yet whether Bingley's
regard had really died away, or were suppressed by his friends' interference; whether he had been aware of Jane's attachment, or whether
it had escaped his observation; whatever were the case, though her
opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference, her sister's situation remained the same, her peace equally wounded.
A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to Elizabeth; but at last, on Mrs. Bennet's leaving them together,
after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she
could not help saying:
“Oh, that my dear mother had more command over herself! She
can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections
on him. But I will not repine. It cannot last long. He will be forgot, and
we shall all be as we were before.”
Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said
nothing.
“You doubt me,” cried Jane, slightly colouring; “indeed, you have
no reason. He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my
acquaintance, but that is all. I have nothing either to hope or fear, and
nothing to reproach him with. Thank God! I have not that pain. A little
time, therefore—I shall certainly try to get the better.”
94
With a stronger voice she soon added, “I have this comfort immediately, that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and
that it has done no harm to anyone but myself.”
“My dear Jane!” exclaimed Elizabeth, “you are too good. Your
sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what
to say to you. I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as
you deserve.”
Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw
back the praise on her sister's warm affection.
“Nay,” said Elizabeth, “this is not fair. You wish to think all the
world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody. I only want
to think you perfect, and you set yourself against it. Do not be afraid
of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your privilege of
universal good-will. You need not. There are few people whom I really
love, and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I see of the world,
the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of
the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the little dependence
that can be placed on the appearance of merit or sense. I have met with
two instances lately, one I will not mention; the other is Charlotte's
marriage. It is unaccountable! In every view it is unaccountable!”
“My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these. They
will ruin your happiness. You do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper. Consider Mr. Collins's respectability,
and Charlotte's steady, prudent character. Remember that she is one
of a large family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be
ready to believe, for everybody's sake, that she may feel something like
regard and esteem for our cousin.”
“To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no one
else could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded
that Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her
understanding than I now do of her heart. My dear Jane, Mr. Collins
is a conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is,
as well as I do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman
who married him cannot have a proper way of thinking. You shall not
defend her, though it is Charlotte Lucas. You shall not, for the sake
of one individual, change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor
endeavour to persuade yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence,
and insensibility of danger security for happiness.”
“I must think your language too strong in speaking of both,”
replied Jane; “and I hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them
happy together. But enough of this. You alluded to something else.
95
You mentioned two instances. I cannot misunderstand you, but I entreat you, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking that person to blame,
and saying your opinion of him is sunk. We must not be so ready
to fancy ourselves intentionally injured. We must not expect a lively
young man to be always so guarded and circumspect. It is very often
nothing but our own vanity that deceives us. Women fancy admiration
means more than it does.”
“And men take care that they should.”
“If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea
of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine.”
“I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley's conduct to design,” said Elizabeth; “but without scheming to do wrong, or to make
others unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery. Thoughtlessness, want of attention to other people's feelings, and want of resolution, will do the business.”
“And do you impute it to either of those?”
“Yes; to the last. But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying what
I think of persons you esteem. Stop me whilst you can.”
“You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him?”
“Yes, in conjunction with his friend.”
“I cannot believe it. Why should they try to influence him? They
can only wish his happiness; and if he is attached to me, no other
woman can secure it.”
“Your first position is false. They may wish many things besides his
happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they
may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money,
great connections, and pride.”
“Beyond a doubt, they do wish him to choose Miss Darcy,” replied
Jane; “but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing.
They have known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love her better. But, whatever may be their own wishes, it
is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother's. What sister
would think herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very
objectionable? If they believed him attached to me, they would not try
to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed. By supposing such an
affection, you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong, and me
most unhappy. Do not distress me by the idea. I am not ashamed of
having been mistaken—or, at least, it is light, it is nothing in comparison of what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters. Let me
take it in the best light, in the light in which it may be understood.”
Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr.
96
Bingley's name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.
Mrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning
no more, and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not
account for it clearly, there was little chance of her ever considering
it with less perplexity. Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of
what she did not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been
merely the effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when
he saw her no more; but though the probability of the statement was
admitted at the time, she had the same story to repeat every day. Mrs.
Bennet's best comfort was that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the
summer.
Mr. Bennet treated the matter differently. “So, Lizzy,” said he one
day, “your sister is crossed in love, I find. I congratulate her. Next to
being married, a girl likes to be crossed a little in love now and then.
It is something to think of, and it gives her a sort of distinction among
her companions. When is your turn to come? You will hardly bear to
be long outdone by Jane. Now is your time. Here are officers enough
in Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country. Let Wickham be your man. He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably.”
“Thank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me. We
must not all expect Jane's good fortune.”
“True,” said Mr. Bennet, “but it is a comfort to think that whatever
of that kind may befall you, you have an affectionate mother who will
make the most of it.”
Mr. Wickham's society was of material service in dispelling the
gloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of
the Longbourn family. They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve. The whole of
what Elizabeth had already heard, his claims on Mr. Darcy, and all that
he had suffered from him, was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody was pleased to know how much they
had always disliked Mr. Darcy before they had known anything of the
matter.
Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might
be any extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society of Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for
allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes—but by everybody
else Mr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.
97
Chapter 25
After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity,
Mr. Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of Saturday. The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his
side, by preparations for the reception of his bride; as he had reason
to hope, that shortly after his return into Hertfordshire, the day would
be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men. He took leave of
his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished
his fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father
another letter of thanks.
On the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the Christmas at Longbourn. Mr. Gardiner was a sensible, gentlemanlike man,
greatly superior to his sister, as well by nature as education. The
Netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man
who lived by trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could
have been so well-bred and agreeable. Mrs. Gardiner, who was several
years younger than Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Phillips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant woman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn
nieces. Between the two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a
particular regard. They had frequently been staying with her in town.
The first part of Mrs. Gardiner's business on her arrival was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions. When this was
done she had a less active part to play. It became her turn to listen.
Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of.
They had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister. Two of
her girls had been upon the point of marriage, and after all there was
nothing in it.
“I do not blame Jane,” she continued, “for Jane would have got Mr.
Bingley if she could. But Lizzy! Oh, sister! It is very hard to think that
she might have been Mr. Collins's wife by this time, had it not been for
her own perverseness. He made her an offer in this very room, and
she refused him. The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have a
daughter married before I have, and that the Longbourn estate is just
as much entailed as ever. The Lucases are very artful people indeed,
sister. They are all for what they can get. I am sorry to say it of them,
but so it is. It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted so
in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves
before anybody else. However, your coming just at this time is the
greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of
98
long sleeves.”
Mrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in the course of Jane and Elizabeth's correspondence with her,
made her sister a slight answer, and, in compassion to her nieces,
turned the conversation.
When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject. “It seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane,” said she.
“I am sorry it went off. But these things happen so often! A young
man, such as you describe Mr. Bingley, so easily falls in love with a
pretty girl for a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets her, that these sort of inconsistencies are very frequent.”
“An excellent consolation in its way,” said Elizabeth, “but it will not
do for us. We do not suffer by accident. It does not often happen that
the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent
fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with
only a few days before.”
“But that expression of ‘violently in love' is so hackneyed, so doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea. It is as often applied
to feelings which arise from a half-hour's acquaintance, as to a real,
strong attachment. Pray, how violent was Mr. Bingley's love?”
“I never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing quite
inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her. Every time
they met, it was more decided and remarkable. At his own ball he
offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance; and
I spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an answer. Could there
be finer symptoms? Is not general incivility the very essence of love?”
“Oh, yes!—of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt.
Poor Jane! I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may
not get over it immediately. It had better have happened to you, Lizzy;
you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner. But do you think she
would be prevailed upon to go back with us? Change of scene might
be of service—and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful
as anything.”
Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded of her sister's ready acquiescence.
“I hope,” added Mrs. Gardiner, “that no consideration with regard
to this young man will influence her. We live in so different a part of
town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we
go out so little, that it is very improbable that they should meet at all,
unless he really comes to see her.”
“And that is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his
99
friend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such
a part of London! My dear aunt, how could you think of it? Mr. Darcy
may perhaps have heard of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he
would hardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse him from its
impurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr. Bingley
never stirs without him.”
“So much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But does not
Jane correspond with his sister? She will not be able to help calling.”
“She will drop the acquaintance entirely.”
But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place
this point, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley's being
withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which
convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely
hopeless. It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that
his affection might be reanimated, and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane's attractions.
Miss Bennet accepted her aunt's invitation with pleasure; and the
Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time, than as
she hoped by Caroline's not living in the same house with her brother,
she might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger
of seeing him.
The Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn; and what with the
Phillipses, the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without
its engagement. Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a
family dinner. When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always made part of it—of which officers Mr. Wickham was sure
to be one; and on these occasion, Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by
Elizabeth's warm commendation, narrowly observed them both. Without supposing them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love,
their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she
left Hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging
such an attachment.
To Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure,
unconnected with his general powers. About ten or a dozen years ago,
before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very
part of Derbyshire to which he belonged. They had, therefore, many
acquaintances in common; and though Wickham had been little there
since the death of Darcy's father, it was yet in his power to give her
fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way
100
of procuring.
Mrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr. Darcy
by character perfectly well. Here consequently was an inexhaustible
subject of discourse. In comparing her recollection of Pemberley with
the minute description which Wickham could give, and in bestowing
her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor, she was delighting both him and herself. On being made acquainted with the
present Mr. Darcy's treatment of him, she tried to remember some of
that gentleman's reputed disposition when quite a lad which might
agree with it, and was confident at last that she recollected having
heard Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, illnatured boy.
Chapter 26
Mrs. Gardiner's caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly
given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone; after
honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on:
“You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because
you are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking
openly. Seriously, I would have you be on your guard. Do not involve
yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of
fortune would make so very imprudent. I have nothing to say against
him; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he
ought to have, I should think you could not do better. But as it is, you
must not let your fancy run away with you. You have sense, and we
all expect you to use it. Your father would depend on your resolution
and good conduct, I am sure. You must not disappoint your father.”
“My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.”
“Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise.”
“Well, then, you need not be under any alarm. I will take care of
myself, and of Mr. Wickham too. He shall not be in love with me, if I
can prevent it.”
“Elizabeth, you are not serious now.”
“I beg your pardon, I will try again. At present I am not in love
with Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not. But he is, beyond all comparison, the most agreeable man I ever saw—and if he becomes really
attached to me—I believe it will be better that he should not. I see the
imprudence of it. Oh! that abominable Mr. Darcy! My father's opinion
of me does me the greatest honour, and I should be miserable to forfeit
101
it. My father, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham. In short, my dear
aunt, I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but since we see every day that where there is affection, young
people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser
than so many of my fellow-creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even
to know that it would be wisdom to resist? All that I can promise you,
therefore, is not to be in a hurry. I will not be in a hurry to believe
myself his first object. When I am in company with him, I will not be
wishing. In short, I will do my best.”
“Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very
often. At least, you should not remind you mother of inviting him.”
“As I did the other day,” said Elizabeth with a conscious smile:
“very true, it will be wise in me to refrain from that. But do not imagine
that he is always here so often. It is on your account that he has been
so frequently invited this week. You know my mother's ideas as to the
necessity of constant company for her friends. But really, and upon my
honour, I will try to do what I think to be the wisest; and now I hope
you are satisfied.”
Her aunt assured her that she was, and Elizabeth having thanked
her for the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of
advice being given on such a point, without being resented.
Mr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases, his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs. Bennet. His marriage was now fast approaching, and she was at length so far resigned
as to think it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say, in an ill-natured
tone, that she “wished they might be happy.” Thursday was to be the
wedding day, and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit;
and when she rose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother's
ungracious and reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself,
accompanied her out of the room. As they went downstairs together,
Charlotte said:
“I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza.”
“That you certainly shall.”
“And I have another favour to ask you. Will you come and see me?”
“We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire.”
“I am not likely to leave Kent for some time. Promise me, therefore,
to come to Hunsford.”
Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the
visit.
102
“My father and Maria are coming to me in March,” added Charlotte, “and I hope you will consent to be of the party. Indeed, Eliza,
you will be as welcome as either of them.”
The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent
from the church door, and everybody had as much to say, or to hear,
on the subject as usual. Elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and
their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been;
that it should be equally unreserved was impossible. Elizabeth could
never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was
over, and though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was
for the sake of what had been, rather than what was. Charlotte's first
letters were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but
be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she
would like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce
herself to be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that
Charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have
foreseen. She wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and
mentioned nothing which she could not praise. The house, furniture,
neighbourhood, and roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine's
behaviour was most friendly and obliging. It was Mr. Collins's picture
of Hunsford and Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived
that she must wait for her own visit there to know the rest.
Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their
safe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it
would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys.
Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is. Jane had been a week in town without either seeing
or hearing from Caroline. She accounted for it, however, by supposing
that her last letter to her friend from Longbourn had by some accident
been lost.
“My aunt,” she continued, “is going to-morrow into that part of the
town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor Street.”
She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss
Bingley. “I did not think Caroline in spirits,” were her words, “but she
was very glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of
my coming to London. I was right, therefore, my last letter had never
reached her. I inquired after their brother, of course. He was well, but
so much engaged with Mr. Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him. I
found that Miss Darcy was expected to dinner. I wish I could see her.
My visit was not long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out. I
dare say I shall see them soon here.”
103
Elizabeth shook her head over this letter. It convinced her that accident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister's being in town.
Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him. She endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could
no longer be blind to Miss Bingley's inattention. After waiting at home
every morning for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay,
and yet more, the alteration of her manner would allow Jane to deceive herself no longer. The letter which she wrote on this occasion to
her sister will prove what she felt.
“My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in her
better judgement, at my expense, when I confess myself to have been
entirely deceived in Miss Bingley's regard for me. But, my dear sister,
though the event has proved you right, do not think me obstinate if
I still assert that, considering what her behaviour was, my confidence
was as natural as your suspicion. I do not at all comprehend her reason
for wishing to be intimate with me; but if the same circumstances were
to happen again, I am sure I should be deceived again. Caroline did not
return my visit till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did I receive
in the meantime. When she did come, it was very evident that she
had no pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal apology, for not calling
before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and was in every
respect so altered a creature, that when she went away I was perfectly
resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. I pity, though I cannot
help blaming her. She was very wrong in singling me out as she did;
I can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on her side. But
I pity her, because she must feel that she has been acting wrong, and
because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it.
I need not explain myself farther; and though we know this anxiety
to be quite needless, yet if she feels it, it will easily account for her
behaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever
anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural and amiable. I cannot but
wonder, however, at her having any such fears now, because, if he had
at all cared about me, we must have met, long ago. He knows of my
being in town, I am certain, from something she said herself; and yet
it would seem, by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to persuade
herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy. I cannot understand it.
If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should be almost tempted to
say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this. But I will
endeavour to banish every painful thought, and think only of what will
make me happy—your affection, and the invariable kindness of my
104
dear uncle and aunt. Let me hear from you very soon. Miss Bingley
said something of his never returning to Netherfield again, of giving
up the house, but not with any certainty. We had better not mention
it. I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our
friends at Hunsford. Pray go to see them, with Sir William and Maria.
I am sure you will be very comfortable there.—Yours, etc.”
This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as
she considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at
least. All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over. She
would not even wish for a renewal of his attentions. His character
sunk on every review of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a
possible advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon
marry Mr. Darcy's sister, as by Wickham's account, she would make
him abundantly regret what he had thrown away.
Mrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise
concerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth
had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to
herself. His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over,
he was the admirer of some one else. Elizabeth was watchful enough
to see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain.
Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied
with believing that she would have been his only choice, had fortune
permitted it. The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the
most remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in
this case than in Charlotte's, did not quarrel with him for his wish of
independence. Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and
while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her,
she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and
could very sincerely wish him happy.
All this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and after relating the
circumstances, she thus went on: “I am now convinced, my dear aunt,
that I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that
pure and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name,
and wish him all manner of evil. But my feelings are not only cordial
towards him; they are even impartial towards Miss King. I cannot find
out that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a
very good sort of girl. There can be no love in all this. My watchfulness
has been effectual; and though I certainly should be a more interesting
object to all my acquaintances were I distractedly in love with him,
I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance. Importance
105
may sometimes be purchased too dearly. Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to heart than I do. They are young in the ways of
the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain.”
Chapter 27
With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes
dirty and sometimes cold, did January and February pass away. March
was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford. She had not at first thought very
seriously of going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan and she gradually learned to consider it herself with
greater pleasure as well as greater certainty. Absence had increased
her desire of seeing Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr.
Collins. There was novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother
and such uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake. The journey would
moreover give her a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near,
she would have been very sorry for any delay. Everything, however,
went on smoothly, and was finally settled according to Charlotte's first
sketch. She was to accompany Sir William and his second daughter.
The improvement of spending a night in London was added in time,
and the plan became perfect as plan could be.
The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss
her, and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that
he told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.
The farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly
friendly; on his side even more. His present pursuit could not make
him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve
his attention, the first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and
in his manner of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh,
and trusting their opinion of her—their opinion of everybody—would
always coincide, there was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must
ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from
him convinced that, whether married or single, he must always be her
model of the amiable and pleasing.
Her fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her
think him less agreeable. Sir William Lucas, and his daughter Maria,
106
a good-humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing
to say that could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as
much delight as the rattle of the chaise. Elizabeth loved absurdities, but
she had known Sir William's too long. He could tell her nothing new
of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities
were worn out, like his information.
It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so
early as to be in Gracechurch Street by noon. As they drove to Mr.
Gardiner's door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their
arrival; when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them,
and Elizabeth, looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it
healthful and lovely as ever. On the stairs were a troop of little boys
and girls, whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had
not seen her for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. All was
joy and kindness. The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning
in bustle and shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.
Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt. Their first object was
her sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply
to her minute inquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support
her spirits, there were periods of dejection. It was reasonable, however,
to hope that they would not continue long. Mrs. Gardiner gave her
the particulars also of Miss Bingley's visit in Gracechurch Street, and
repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and
herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the
acquaintance.
Mrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham's desertion, and
complimented her on bearing it so well.
“But my dear Elizabeth,” she added, “what sort of girl is Miss King?
I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary.”
“Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs,
between the mercenary and the prudent motive? Where does discretion end, and avarice begin? Last Christmas you were afraid of his
marrying me, because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is
trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find
out that he is mercenary.”
“If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know
what to think.”
“She is a very good kind of girl, I believe. I know no harm of her.”
“But he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather's
death made her mistress of this fortune.”
107
“No—what should he? If it were not allowable for him to gain my
affections because I had no money, what occasion could there be for
making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally
poor?”
“But there seems an indelicacy in directing his attentions towards
her so soon after this event.”
“A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe. If she does not object
to it, why should we?”
“Her not objecting does not justify him. It only shows her being
deficient in something herself—sense or feeling.”
“Well,” cried Elizabeth, “have it as you choose. He shall be mercenary, and she shall be foolish.”
“No, Lizzy, that is what I do not choose. I should be sorry, you
know, to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire.”
“Oh! if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who
live in Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire
are not much better. I am sick of them all. Thank Heaven! I am going
to-morrow where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality,
who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him. Stupid men are
the only ones worth knowing, after all.”
“Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment.”
Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had
the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and
aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.
“We have not determined how far it shall carry us,” said Mrs. Gardiner, “but, perhaps, to the Lakes.”
No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her
acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful. “Oh, my
dear, dear aunt,” she rapturously cried, “what delight! what felicity! You give me fresh life and vigour. Adieu to disappointment and
spleen. What are young men to rocks and mountains? Oh! what hours
of transport we shall spend! And when we do return, it shall not be
like other travellers, without being able to give one accurate idea of
anything. We will know where we have gone—we will recollect what
we have seen. Lakes, mountains, and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations; nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin quarreling about its relative situation. Let
our first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of
travellers.”
108
Chapter 28
Every object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to
Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment; for she had seen
her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health, and the
prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.
When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye
was in search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring
it in view. The palings of Rosings Park was their boundary on one
side. Elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its
inhabitants.
At length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden sloping to the
road, the house standing in it, the green pales, and the laurel hedge,
everything declared they were arriving. Mr. Collins and Charlotte appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate which
led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of
the whole party. In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at the sight of each other. Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with
the liveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with
coming when she found herself so affectionately received. She saw instantly that her cousin's manners were not altered by his marriage; his
formal civility was just what it had been, and he detained her some
minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her family.
They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness
of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they were in the
parlour, he welcomed them a second time, with ostentatious formality
to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife's offers of
refreshment.
Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not
help in fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its
aspect and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her, as if
wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him. But though
everything seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify
him by any sigh of repentance, and rather looked with wonder at her
friend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion.
When Mr. Collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be
ashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned
her eye on Charlotte. Once or twice she could discern a faint blush;
but in general Charlotte wisely did not hear. After sitting long enough
to admire every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard
to the fender, to give an account of their journey, and of all that had
109
happened in London, Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in the
garden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of
which he attended himself. To work in this garden was one of his most
respectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise,
and owned she encouraged it as much as possible. Here, leading the
way through every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them
an interval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out
with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind. He could number the fields in every direction, and could tell how many tress there
were in the most distant clump. But of all the views which his garden,
or which the country or kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with the prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees
that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house. It was a
handsome modern building, well situated on rising ground.
From his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two
meadows; but the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the remains of
a white frost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him,
Charlotte took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well
pleased, probably, to have the opportunity of showing it without her
husband's help. It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and
everything was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency
of which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit. When Mr. Collins
could be forgotten, there was really an air of great comfort throughout, and by Charlotte's evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he
must be often forgotten.
She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country.
It was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins
joining in, observed:
“Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady
Catherine de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not
say you will be delighted with her. She is all affability and condescension, and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of
her notice when service is over. I have scarcely any hesitation in saying she will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with
which she honours us during your stay here. Her behaviour to my
dear Charlotte is charming. We dine at Rosings twice every week, and
are never allowed to walk home. Her ladyship's carriage is regularly
ordered for us. I should say, one of her ladyship's carriages, for she has
several.”
“Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed,”
110
added Charlotte, “and a most attentive neighbour.”
“Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say. She is the sort of
woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.”
The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news,
and telling again what had already been written; and when it closed,
Elizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to meditate upon Charlotte's degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding,
and composure in bearing with, her husband, and to acknowledge
that it was all done very well. She had also to anticipate how her visit
would pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious
interruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with
Rosings. A lively imagination soon settled it all.
About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting
ready for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole
house in confusion; and, after listening a moment, she heard somebody
running upstairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her. She
opened the door and met Maria in the landing place, who, breathless
with agitation, cried out—
“Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the diningroom, for there is such a sight to be seen! I will not tell you what it is.
Make haste, and come down this moment.”
Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing
more, and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the lane,
in quest of this wonder; It was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at
the garden gate.
“And is this all?” cried Elizabeth. “I expected at least that the pigs
were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and
her daughter.”
“La! my dear,” said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, “it is not
Lady Catherine. The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them;
the other is Miss de Bourgh. Only look at her. She is quite a little creature. Who would have thought that she could be so thin and small?”
“She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this
wind. Why does she not come in?”
“Oh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does. It is the greatest of
favours when Miss de Bourgh comes in.”
“I like her appearance,” said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas.
“She looks sickly and cross. Yes, she will do for him very well. She
will make him a very proper wife.”
Mr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth's high diversion,
111
was stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss de Bourgh
looked that way.
At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on,
and the others returned into the house. Mr. Collins no sooner saw the
two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune,
which Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party
was asked to dine at Rosings the next day.
Chapter 29
Mr. Collins's triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was complete. The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his
wondering visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself
and his wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of Lady
Catherine's condescension, as he knew not how to admire enough.
“I confess,” said he, “that I should not have been at all surprised by
her ladyship's asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening
at Rosings. I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that
it would happen. But who could have foreseen such an attention as
this? Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation
to dine there (an invitation, moreover, including the whole party) so
immediately after your arrival!”
“I am the less surprised at what has happened,” replied Sir William,
“from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are,
which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire. About the court,
such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon.”
Scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but
their visit to Rosings. Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in
what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and so splendid a dinner, might not wholly overpower them.
When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to
Elizabeth—
“Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel.
Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which
becomes herself and her daughter. I would advise you merely to put
on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest—there is no occasion for anything more. Lady Catherine will not think the worse of
you for being simply dressed. She likes to have the distinction of rank
112
preserved.”
While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very
much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner. Such formidable
accounts of her ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened
Maria Lucas who had been little used to company, and she looked forward to her introduction at Rosings with as much apprehension as her
father had done to his presentation at St. James's.
As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half
a mile across the park. Every park has its beauty and its prospects;
and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be
in such raptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was
but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the
house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally
cost Sir Lewis de Bourgh.
When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria's alarm was
every moment increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly
calm. Elizabeth's courage did not fail her. She had heard nothing of
Lady Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents
or miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money or rank she
thought she could witness without trepidation.
From the entrance-hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a
rapturous air, the fine proportion and the finished ornaments, they
followed the servants through an ante-chamber, to the room where
Lady Catherine, her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting. Her
ladyship, with great condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs.
Collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction
should be hers, it was performed in a proper manner, without any of
those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary.
In spite of having been at St. James's Sir William was so completely
awed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage
enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a
word; and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the
edge of her chair, not knowing which way to look. Elizabeth found
herself quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her composedly. Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with
strongly-marked features, which might once have been handsome.
Her air was not conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them
such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank. She was not rendered formidable by silence; but whatever she said was spoken in so
authoritative a tone, as marked her self-importance, and brought Mr.
113
Wickham immediately to Elizabeth's mind; and from the observation
of the day altogether, she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what
he represented.
When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned
her eyes on the daughter, she could almost have joined in Maria's astonishment at her being so thin and so small. There was neither in
figure nor face any likeness between the ladies. Miss de Bourgh was
pale and sickly; her features, though not plain, were insignificant; and
she spoke very little, except in a low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose
appearance there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper
direction before her eyes.
After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows
to admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties,
and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better
worth looking at in the summer.
The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants and all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and,
as he had likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table,
by her ladyship's desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater. He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted
alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him and then by Sir
William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-inlaw said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could
bear. But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the
table proved a novelty to them. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh—the
former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine, and the
latter said not a word to her all dinner-time. Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly
employed in watching how little Miss de Bourgh ate, pressing her to
try some other dish, and fearing she was indisposed. Maria thought
speaking out of the question, and the gentlemen did nothing but eat
and admire.
When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to
be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any
intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner, as proved that she was not used to have
her judgement controverted. She inquired into Charlotte's domestic
114
concerns familiarly and minutely, gave her a great deal of advice as to
the management of them all; told her how everything ought to be regulated in so small a family as hers, and instructed her as to the care of
her cows and her poultry. Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath
this great lady's attention, which could furnish her with an occasion of
dictating to others. In the intervals of her discourse with Mrs. Collins,
she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew the least, and who
she observed to Mrs. Collins was a very genteel, pretty kind of girl. She
asked her, at different times, how many sisters she had, whether they
were older or younger than herself, whether any of them were likely
to be married, whether they were handsome, where they had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her mother's
maiden name? Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions but
answered them very composedly. Lady Catherine then observed,
“Your father's estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think. For your
sake,” turning to Charlotte, “I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no
occasion for entailing estates from the female line. It was not thought
necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh's family. Do you play and sing, Miss
Bennet?”
“A little.”
“Oh! then—some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. Our
instrument is a capital one, probably superior to——You shall try it
some day. Do your sisters play and sing?”
“One of them does.”
“Why did not you all learn? You ought all to have learned. The
Miss Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as
yours. Do you draw?”
“No, not at all.”
“What, none of you?”
“Not one.”
“That is very strange. But I suppose you had no opportunity. Your
mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of
masters.”
“My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates London.”
“Has your governess left you?”
“We never had any governess.”
“No governess! How was that possible? Five daughters brought
up at home without a governess! I never heard of such a thing. Your
mother must have been quite a slave to your education.”
115
Elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not
been the case.
“Then, who taught you? who attended to you? Without a governess, you must have been neglected.”
“Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as
wished to learn never wanted the means. We were always encouraged
to read, and had all the masters that were necessary. Those who chose
to be idle, certainly might.”
“Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if I
had known your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously
to engage one. I always say that nothing is to be done in education
without steady and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess
can give it. It is wonderful how many families I have been the means
of supplying in that way. I am always glad to get a young person
well placed out. Four nieces of Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully
situated through my means; and it was but the other day that I recommended another young person, who was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite delighted with her. Mrs. Collins,
did I tell you of Lady Metcalf's calling yesterday to thank me? She
finds Miss Pope a treasure. ‘Lady Catherine,' said she, ‘you have given
me a treasure.' Are any of your younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?”
“Yes, ma'am, all.”
“All! What, all five out at once? Very odd! And you only the second. The younger ones out before the elder ones are married! Your
younger sisters must be very young?”
“Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps she is full young to be
much in company. But really, ma'am, I think it would be very hard
upon younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society
and amusement, because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early. The last-born has as good a right to the pleasures
of youth at the first. And to be kept back on such a motive! I think
it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of
mind.”
“Upon my word,” said her ladyship, “you give your opinion very
decidedly for so young a person. Pray, what is your age?”
“With three younger sisters grown up,” replied Elizabeth, smiling,
“your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it.”
Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct
answer; and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who
had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.
“You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure, therefore you need not
116
conceal your age.”
“I am not one-and-twenty.”
When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the cardtables were placed. Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs.
Collins sat down to quadrille; and as Miss de Bourgh chose to play
at cassino, the two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson
to make up her party. Their table was superlatively stupid. Scarcely
a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game, except when
Mrs. Jenkinson expressed her fears of Miss de Bourgh's being too hot
or too cold, or having too much or too little light. A great deal more
passed at the other table. Lady Catherine was generally speaking—
stating the mistakes of the three others, or relating some anecdote of
herself. Mr. Collins was employed in agreeing to everything her ladyship said, thanking her for every fish he won, and apologising if
he thought he won too many. Sir William did not say much. He was
storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names.
When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as
they chose, the tables were broken up, the carriage was offered to
Mrs. Collins, gratefully accepted and immediately ordered. The party
then gathered round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what
weather they were to have on the morrow. From these instructions they
were summoned by the arrival of the coach; and with many speeches of
thankfulness on Mr. Collins's side and as many bows on Sir William's
they departed. As soon as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth
was called on by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen
at Rosings, which, for Charlotte's sake, she made more favourable than
it really was. But her commendation, though costing her some trouble,
could by no means satisfy Mr. Collins, and he was very soon obliged
to take her ladyship's praise into his own hands.
Chapter 30
Sir William stayed only a week at Hunsford, but his visit was long
enough to convince him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled, and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as
were not often met with. While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins
devoted his morning to driving him out in his gig, and showing him
the country; but when he went away, the whole family returned to
their usual employments, and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they
did not see more of her cousin by the alteration, for the chief of the
117
time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at
work in the garden or in reading and writing, and looking out of the
window in his own book-room, which fronted the road. The room in
which the ladies sat was backwards. Elizabeth had at first rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the dining-parlour for common
use; it was a better sized room, and had a more pleasant aspect; but
she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did,
for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own
apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and she gave Charlotte
credit for the arrangement.
From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane,
and were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages
went along, and how often especially Miss de Bourgh drove by in her
phaeton, which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it
happened almost every day. She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had a few minutes' conversation with Charlotte, but was
scarcely ever prevailed upon to get out.
Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings, and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go
likewise; and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of
so many hours. Now and then they were honoured with a call from
her ladyship, and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in
the room during these visits. She examined into their employments,
looked at their work, and advised them to do it differently; found fault
with the arrangement of the furniture; or detected the housemaid in
negligence; and if she accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only
for the sake of finding out that Mrs. Collins's joints of meat were too
large for her family.
Elizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in
commission of the peace of the county, she was a most active magistrate in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to
her by Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to
be quarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold them
into harmony and plenty.
The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a
week; and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only
one card-table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first. Their other engagements were few, as the style of
living in the neighbourhood in general was beyond Mr. Collins's reach.
118
This, however, was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent
her time comfortably enough; there were half-hours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of
year that she had often great enjoyment out of doors. Her favourite
walk, and where she frequently went while the others were calling on
Lady Catherine, was along the open grove which edged that side of the
park, where there was a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to
value but herself, and where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine's curiosity.
In this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.
Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it was to bring an
addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be
important. Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that Mr. Darcy
was expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there
were not many of her acquaintances whom she did not prefer, his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings
parties, and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley's designs on him were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom
he was evidently destined by Lady Catherine, who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest
admiration, and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been
frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself.
His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr. Collins was
walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into
Hunsford Lane, in order to have the earliest assurance of it, and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the Park, hurried home
with the great intelligence. On the following morning he hastened to
Rosings to pay his respects. There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for Mr. Darcy had brought with him a Colonel
Fitzwilliam, the younger son of his uncle Lord ——, and, to the great
surprise of all the party, when Mr. Collins returned, the gentleman accompanied him. Charlotte had seen them from her husband's room,
crossing the road, and immediately running into the other, told the
girls what an honour they might expect, adding:
“I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility. Mr. Darcy would
never have come so soon to wait upon me.”
Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment,
before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room. Colonel Fitzwilliam,
who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and address most truly the gentleman. Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been
119
used to look in Hertfordshire—paid his compliments, with his usual
reserve, to Mrs. Collins, and whatever might be his feelings toward
her friend, met her with every appearance of composure. Elizabeth
merely curtseyed to him without saying a word.
Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the
readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but
his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house
and garden to Mrs. Collins, sat for some time without speaking to anybody. At length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of Elizabeth after the health of her family. She answered him in
the usual way, and after a moment's pause, added:
“My eldest sister has been in town these three months. Have you
never happened to see her there?”
She was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to
see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed
between the Bingleys and Jane, and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet
Miss Bennet. The subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen
soon afterwards went away.
Chapter 31
Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the Parsonage, and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the
pleasures of their engagements at Rosings. It was some days, however, before they received any invitation thither—for while there were
visitors in the house, they could not be necessary; and it was not till
Easter-day, almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival, that they were
honoured by such an attention, and then they were merely asked on
leaving church to come there in the evening. For the last week they had
seen very little of Lady Catherine or her daughter. Colonel Fitzwilliam
had called at the Parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr.
Darcy they had seen only at church.
The invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they
joined the party in Lady Catherine's drawing-room. Her ladyship received them civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no
means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was,
in fact, almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially
to Darcy, much more than to any other person in the room.
Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; anything was
120
a welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins's pretty friend
had moreover caught his fancy very much. He now seated himself
by her, and talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying at home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had
never been half so well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady
Catherine herself, as well as of Mr. Darcy. His eyes had been soon and
repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her
ladyship, after a while, shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not scruple to call out:
“What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is it you are talking
of? What are you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear what it is.”
“We are speaking of music, madam,” said he, when no longer able
to avoid a reply.
“Of music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects my delight.
I must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music. There are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true
enjoyment of music than myself, or a better natural taste. If I had ever
learnt, I should have been a great proficient. And so would Anne, if
her health had allowed her to apply. I am confident that she would
have performed delightfully. How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?”
Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's proficiency.
“I am very glad to hear such a good account of her,” said Lady
Catherine; “and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel
if she does not practice a good deal.”
“I assure you, madam,” he replied, “that she does not need such
advice. She practises very constantly.”
“So much the better. It cannot be done too much; and when I next
write to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account. I often
tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without constant practice. I have told Miss Bennet several times, that she
will never play really well unless she practises more; and though Mrs.
Collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often told
her, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the pianoforte in Mrs.
Jenkinson's room. She would be in nobody's way, you know, in that
part of the house.”
Mr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt's ill-breeding, and
made no answer.
When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of
having promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument. He drew a chair near her. Lady Catherine listened to half
121
a song, and then talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from her, and making with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte stationed himself so as to command a full view
of the fair performer's countenance. Elizabeth saw what he was doing,
and at the first convenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile,
and said:
“You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state to
hear me? I will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well.
There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened
at the will of others. My courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate me.”
“I shall not say you are mistaken,” he replied, “because you could
not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I
have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that
you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in
fact are not your own.”
Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to
Colonel Fitzwilliam, “Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion
of me, and teach you not to believe a word I say. I am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so able to expose my real character, in
a part of the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some
degree of credit. Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to
mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire—and,
give me leave to say, very impolitic too—for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such things may come out as will shock your relations to
hear.”
“I am not afraid of you,” said he, smilingly.
“Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of,” cried Colonel
Fitzwilliam. “I should like to know how he behaves among strangers.”
“You shall hear then—but prepare yourself for something very
dreadful. The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you
must know, was at a ball—and at this ball, what do you think he did?
He danced only four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to
my certain knowledge, more than one young lady was sitting down in
want of a partner. Mr. Darcy, you cannot deny the fact.”
“I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party.”
“True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room. Well,
Colonel Fitzwilliam, what do I play next? My fingers wait your orders.”
“Perhaps,” said Darcy, “I should have judged better, had I sought
122
an introduction; but I am ill-qualified to recommend myself to
strangers.”
“Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?” said Elizabeth, still
addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam. “Shall we ask him why a man of sense
and education, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers?”
“I can answer your question,” said Fitzwilliam, “without applying
to him. It is because he will not give himself the trouble.”
“I certainly have not the talent which some people possess,” said
Darcy, “of conversing easily with those I have never seen before. I
cannot catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their
concerns, as I often see done.”
“My fingers,” said Elizabeth, “do not move over this instrument in
the masterly manner which I see so many women's do. They have not
the same force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression.
But then I have always supposed it to be my own fault—because I will
not take the trouble of practising. It is not that I do not believe my
fingers as capable as any other woman's of superior execution.”
Darcy smiled and said, “You are perfectly right. You have employed your time much better. No one admitted to the privilege of
hearing you can think anything wanting. We neither of us perform to
strangers.”
Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to
know what they were talking of. Elizabeth immediately began playing again. Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few
minutes, said to Darcy:
“Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more, and
could have the advantage of a London master. She has a very good notion of fingering, though her taste is not equal to Anne's. Anne would
have been a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn.”
Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his
cousin's praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she
discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour
to Miss de Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he
might have been just as likely to marry her, had she been his relation.
Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth's performance,
mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste. Elizabeth
received them with all the forbearance of civility, and, at the request of
the gentlemen, remained at the instrument till her ladyship's carriage
was ready to take them all home.
123
Chapter 32
Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to
Jane while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village, when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal
of a visitor. As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely
to be Lady Catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away
her half-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions,
when the door opened, and, to her very great surprise, Mr. Darcy, and
Mr. Darcy only, entered the room.
He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for
his intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies
were to be within.
They then sat down, and when her inquiries after Rosings were
made, seemed in danger of sinking into total silence. It was absolutely
necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergence recollecting when she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure,
she observed:
“How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November,
Mr. Darcy! It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley
to see you all after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but
the day before. He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left
London?”
“Perfectly so, I thank you.”
She found that she was to receive no other answer, and, after a short
pause added:
“I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of
ever returning to Netherfield again?”
“I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend
very little of his time there in the future. He has many friends, and is
at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing.”
“If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for the
neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we
might possibly get a settled family there. But, perhaps, Mr. Bingley did
not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood
as for his own, and we must expect him to keep it or quit it on the same
principle.”
“I should not be surprised,” said Darcy, “if he were to give it up as
soon as any eligible purchase offers.”
124
Elizabeth made no answer. She was afraid of talking longer of his
friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave
the trouble of finding a subject to him.
He took the hint, and soon began with, “This seems a very comfortable house. Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr.
Collins first came to Hunsford.”
“I believe she did—and I am sure she could not have bestowed her
kindness on a more grateful object.”
“Mr. Collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a wife.”
“Yes, indeed, his friends may well rejoice in his having met with
one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him,
or have made him happy if they had. My friend has an excellent
understanding—though I am not certain that I consider her marrying
Mr. Collins as the wisest thing she ever did. She seems perfectly happy,
however, and in a prudential light it is certainly a very good match for
her.”
“It must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy a
distance of her own family and friends.”
“An easy distance, do you call it? It is nearly fifty miles.”
“And what is fifty miles of good road? Little more than half a day's
journey. Yes, I call it a very easy distance.”
“I should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match,” cried Elizabeth. “I should never have said Mrs.
Collins was settled near her family.”
“It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire. Anything
beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far.”
As he spoke there was a sort of smile which Elizabeth fancied she
understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and
Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered:
“I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near
her family. The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many
varying circumstances. Where there is fortune to make the expenses
of travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil. But that is not
the case here. Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income, but not
such a one as will allow of frequent journeys—and I am persuaded my
friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the
present distance.”
Mr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, “You cannot
have a right to such very strong local attachment. You cannot have been
always at Longbourn.”
125
Elizabeth looked surprised. The gentleman experienced some
change of feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the
table, and glancing over it, said, in a colder voice:
“Are you pleased with Kent?”
A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side
calm and concise—and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte
and her sister, just returned from her walk. The tete-a-tete surprised
them. Mr. Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to anybody, went away.
“What can be the meaning of this?” said Charlotte, as soon as he
was gone. “My dear, Eliza, he must be in love with you, or he would
never have called us in this familiar way.”
But when Elizabeth told of his silence; it did not seem very likely,
even to Charlotte's wishes, to be the case; and after various conjectures,
they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty
of finding anything to do, which was the more probable from the time
of year. All field sports were over. Within doors there was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard-table, but gentlemen cannot always be within
doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the pleasantness of the
walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the two cousins found a
temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day. They
called at various times of the morning, sometimes separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their aunt. It was
plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended him
still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her former
favourite George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw
there was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners,
she believed he might have the best informed mind.
But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more
difficult to understand. It could not be for society, as he frequently
sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he
did speak, it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice—a
sacrifice to propriety, not a pleasure to himself. He seldom appeared
really animated. Mrs. Collins knew not what to make of him. Colonel
Fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was
generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have
told her; and as she would liked to have believed this change the effect
of love, and the object of that love her friend Eliza, she set herself seri126
ously to work to find it out. She watched him whenever they were at
Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success. He certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression
of that look was disputable. It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she
often doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind.
She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his
being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs.
Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of
raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in
her opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend's dislike
would vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.
In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam. He was beyond comparison the most pleasant man; he certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most
eligible; but, to counterbalance these advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable patronage in the church, and his cousin could have none at
all.
Chapter 33
More than once did Elizabeth, in her ramble within the park, unexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy. She felt all the perverseness of the mischance
that should bring him where no one else was brought, and, to prevent
its ever happening again, took care to inform him at first that it was
a favourite haunt of hers. How it could occur a second time, therefore, was very odd! Yet it did, and even a third. It seemed like wilful
ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was not
merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away,
but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her. He
never said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or
of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre
that he was asking some odd unconnected questions—about her pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her opinion
of Mr. and Mrs. Collins's happiness; and that in speaking of Rosings
and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to expect
that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying there
too. His words seemed to imply it. Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam
in his thoughts? She supposed, if he meant anything, he must mean
an allusion to what might arise in that quarter. It distressed her a little,
127
and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite
the Parsonage.
She was engaged one day as she walked, in perusing Jane's last
letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had
not written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr.
Darcy, she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting
her. Putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile, she said:
“I did not know before that you ever walked this way.”
“I have been making the tour of the park,” he replied, “as I generally do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage.
Are you going much farther?”
“No, I should have turned in a moment.”
And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage together.
“Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?” said she.
“Yes—if Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his disposal.
He arranges the business just as he pleases.”
“And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at
least pleasure in the great power of choice. I do not know anybody
who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr.
Darcy.”
“He likes to have his own way very well,” replied Colonel
Fitzwilliam. “But so we all do. It is only that he has better means
of having it than many others, because he is rich, and many others are
poor. I speak feelingly. A younger son, you know, must be inured to
self-denial and dependence.”
“In my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of
either. Now seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and dependence? When have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose, or procuring anything you had a fancy for?”
“These are home questions—and perhaps I cannot say that I have
experienced many hardships of that nature. But in matters of greater
weight, I may suffer from want of money. Younger sons cannot marry
where they like.”
“Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very
often do.”
“Our habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are too
many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money.”
“Is this,” thought Elizabeth, “meant for me?” and she coloured
at the idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, “And pray,
128
what is the usual price of an earl's younger son? Unless the elder
brother is very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds.”
He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. To
interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what
had passed, she soon afterwards said:
“I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the
sake of having someone at his disposal. I wonder he does not marry, to
secure a lasting convenience of that kind. But, perhaps, his sister does
as well for the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do
what he likes with her.”
“No,” said Colonel Fitzwilliam, “that is an advantage which he
must divide with me. I am joined with him in the guardianship of
Miss Darcy.”
“Are you indeed? And pray what sort of guardians do you make?
Does your charge give you much trouble? Young ladies of her age are
sometimes a little difficult to manage, and if she has the true Darcy
spirit, she may like to have her own way.”
As she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the
manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss
Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had
somehow or other got pretty near the truth. She directly replied:
“You need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of her; and I
dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world. She is a
very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst
and Miss Bingley. I think I have heard you say that you know them.”
“I know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike
man—he is a great friend of Darcy's.”
“Oh! yes,” said Elizabeth drily; “Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to
Mr. Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.”
“Care of him! Yes, I really believe Darcy does take care of him in
those points where he most wants care. From something that he told
me in our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much
indebted to him. But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to
suppose that Bingley was the person meant. It was all conjecture.”
“What is it you mean?”
“It is a circumstance which Darcy could not wish to be generally
known, because if it were to get round to the lady's family, it would be
an unpleasant thing.”
“You may depend upon my not mentioning it.”
“And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to
129
be Bingley. What he told me was merely this: that he congratulated
himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a
most imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other
particulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him the
kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from knowing
them to have been together the whole of last summer.”
“Did Mr. Darcy give you reasons for this interference?”
“I understood that there were some very strong objections against
the lady.”
“And what arts did he use to separate them?”
“He did not talk to me of his own arts,” said Fitzwilliam, smiling.
“He only told me what I have now told you.”
Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with
indignation. After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she
was so thoughtful.
“I am thinking of what you have been telling me,” said she. “Your
cousin's conduct does not suit my feelings. Why was he to be the
judge?”
“You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?”
“I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of
his friend's inclination, or why, upon his own judgement alone, he was
to determine and direct in what manner his friend was to be happy.
But,” she continued, recollecting herself, “as we know none of the particulars, it is not fair to condemn him. It is not to be supposed that there
was much affection in the case.”
“That is not an unnatural surmise,” said Fitzwilliam, “but it is a
lessening of the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly.”
This was spoken jestingly; but it appeared to her so just a picture of
Mr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer, and therefore, abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent matters
until they reached the Parsonage. There, shut into her own room, as
soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption of
all that she had heard. It was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected. There
could not exist in the world two men over whom Mr. Darcy could have
such boundless influence. That he had been concerned in the measures
taken to separate Bingley and Jane she had never doubted; but she had
always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement of them. If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him, he
was the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause, of all that Jane
had suffered, and still continued to suffer. He had ruined for a while
130
every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart in
the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have
inflicted.
“There were some very strong objections against the lady,” were
Colonel Fitzwilliam's words; and those strong objections probably
were, her having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another
who was in business in London.
“To Jane herself,” she exclaimed, “there could be no possibility of
objection; all loveliness and goodness as she is!—her understanding
excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating. Neither
could anything be urged against my father, who, though with some
peculiarities, has abilities Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain, and respectability which he will probably never each.” When she thought of
her mother, her confidence gave way a little; but she would not allow
that any objections there had material weight with Mr. Darcy, whose
pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from the
want of importance in his friend's connections, than from their want
of sense; and she was quite decided, at last, that he had been partly
governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of retaining Mr. Bingley for his sister.
The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a
headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening, that, added
to her unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined her not to attend
her cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea. Mrs.
Collins, seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go and
as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her; but Mr.
Collins could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine's being
rather displeased by her staying at home.
Chapter 34
When they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her employment
the examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her
being in Kent. They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any
revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.
But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that
cheerfulness which had been used to characterise her style, and which,
proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly
disposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded. Elizabeth
131
noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal. Mr. Darcy's
shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her a
keener sense of her sister's sufferings. It was some consolation to think
that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next—and, a
still greater, that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with Jane
again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits, by all
that affection could do.
She could not think of Darcy's leaving Kent without remembering
that his cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made
it clear that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she
did not mean to be unhappy about him.
While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of
the door-bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its
being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in
the evening, and might now come to inquire particularly after her. But
this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the
room. In an hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her
health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better. She
answered him with cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, and
then getting up, walked about the room. Elizabeth was surprised, but
said not a word. After a silence of several minutes, he came towards
her in an agitated manner, and thus began:
“In vain I have struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be
repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and
love you.”
Elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression. She stared,
coloured, doubted, and was silent. This he considered sufficient encouragement; and the avowal of all that he felt, and had long felt for
her, immediately followed. He spoke well; but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed; and he was not more eloquent on
the subject of tenderness than of pride. His sense of her inferiority—
of its being a degradation—of the family obstacles which had always
opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed
due to the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to
recommend his suit.
In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to
the compliment of such a man's affection, and though her intentions
did not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was
to receive; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she
132
lost all compassion in anger. She tried, however, to compose herself
to answer him with patience, when he should have done. He concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which,
in spite of all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and
with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand. As he said this, she could easily see that he had no
doubt of a favourable answer. He spoke of apprehension and anxiety,
but his countenance expressed real security. Such a circumstance could
only exasperate farther, and, when he ceased, the colour rose into her
cheeks, and she said:
“In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to express
a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however unequally
they may be returned. It is natural that obligation should be felt, and
if I could feel gratitude, I would now thank you. But I cannot—I have
never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly bestowed it
most unwillingly. I am sorry to have occasioned pain to anyone. It has
been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be of short
duration. The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in overcoming
it after this explanation.”
Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his eyes
fixed on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment
than surprise. His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature. He was struggling for
the appearance of composure, and would not open his lips till he believed himself to have attained it. The pause was to Elizabeth's feelings
dreadful. At length, with a voice of forced calmness, he said:
“And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting! I might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little endeavour
at civility, I am thus rejected. But it is of small importance.”
“I might as well inquire,” replied she, “why with so evident a desire of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked
me against your will, against your reason, and even against your character? Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I was uncivil? But I
have other provocations. You know I have. Had not my feelings decided against you—had they been indifferent, or had they even been
favourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to
accept the man who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever,
the happiness of a most beloved sister?”
As she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the
emotion was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her
133
while she continued:
“I have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No motive
can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there. You dare
not, you cannot deny, that you have been the principal, if not the only
means of dividing them from each other—of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability, and the other to its derision for disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the
acutest kind.”
She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of
remorse. He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.
“Can you deny that you have done it?” she repeated.
With assumed tranquillity he then replied: “I have no wish of denying that I did everything in my power to separate my friend from your
sister, or that I rejoice in my success. Towards him I have been kinder
than towards myself.”
Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection,
but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.
“But it is not merely this affair,” she continued, “on which my dislike is founded. Long before it had taken place my opinion of you was
decided. Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received
many months ago from Mr. Wickham. On this subject, what can you
have to say? In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend
yourself? or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon
others?”
“You take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns,” said
Darcy, in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.
“Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling
an interest in him?”
“His misfortunes!” repeated Darcy contemptuously; “yes, his misfortunes have been great indeed.”
“And of your infliction,” cried Elizabeth with energy. “You have reduced him to his present state of poverty—comparative poverty. You
have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for him. You have deprived the best years of his life of that
independence which was no less his due than his desert. You have
done all this! and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortune with
contempt and ridicule.”
“And this,” cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the
room, “is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you
hold me! I thank you for explaining it so fully. My faults, according
134
to this calculation, are heavy indeed! But perhaps,” added he, stopping in his walk, and turning towards her, “these offenses might have
been overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious
design. These bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I,
with greater policy, concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the
belief of my being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by
reason, by reflection, by everything. But disguise of every sort is my
abhorrence. Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related. They were natural and just. Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your
connections?—to congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose
condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?”
Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she
tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said:
“You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your
declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared the concern
which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a more
gentlemanlike manner.”
She saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued:
“You could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible
way that would have tempted me to accept it.”
Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an
expression of mingled incredulity and mortification. She went on:
“From the very beginning—from the first moment, I may almost
say—of my acquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me with
the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form the groundwork of
disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable
a dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were
the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.”
“You have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend your
feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.
Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my
best wishes for your health and happiness.”
And with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard
him the next moment open the front door and quit the house.
The tumult of her mind, was now painfully great. She knew not
how to support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried
for half-an-hour. Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had
passed, was increased by every review of it. That she should receive
an offer of marriage from Mr. Darcy! That he should have been in
135
love with her for so many months! So much in love as to wish to
marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent
his friend's marrying her sister, and which must appear at least with
equal force in his own case—was almost incredible! It was gratifying to
have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection. But his pride, his
abominable pride—his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to Jane—his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though
he could not justify it, and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr. Wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted
to deny, soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited. She continued in very agitated reflections till the sound of Lady Catherine's carriage made her feel how
unequal she was to encounter Charlotte's observation, and hurried her
away to her room.
Chapter 35
Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes. She could not yet recover
from the surprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of
anything else; and, totally indisposed for employment, she resolved,
soon after breakfast, to indulge herself in air and exercise. She was
proceeding directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr.
Darcy's sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering
the park, she turned up the lane, which led farther from the turnpikeroad. The park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon
passed one of the gates into the ground.
After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was
tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and
look into the park. The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent
had made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding
to the verdure of the early trees. She was on the point of continuing
her walk, when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort
of grove which edged the park; he was moving that way; and, fearful
of its being Mr. Darcy, she was directly retreating. But the person who
advanced was now near enough to see her, and stepping forward with
eagerness, pronounced her name. She had turned away; but on hearing herself called, though in a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy,
she moved again towards the gate. He had by that time reached it also,
and, holding out a letter, which she instinctively took, said, with a look
136
of haughty composure, “I have been walking in the grove some time
in the hope of meeting you. Will you do me the honour of reading that
letter?” And then, with a slight bow, turned again into the plantation,
and was soon out of sight.
With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,
Elizabeth opened the letter, and, to her still increasing wonder, perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter-paper, written quite
through, in a very close hand. The envelope itself was likewise full.
Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it. It was dated from
Rosings, at eight o'clock in the morning, and was as follows:—
“Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of
those offers which were last night so disgusting to you. I write without any intention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on
wishes which, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten;
and the effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must
occasion, should have been spared, had not my character required it
to be written and read. You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with
which I demand your attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it
unwillingly, but I demand it of your justice.
“Two offenses of a very different nature, and by no means of equal
magnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first mentioned was,
that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached Mr. Bingley from your sister, and the other, that I had, in defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham. Wilfully and
wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged favourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other
dependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to
expect its exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of
two young persons, whose affection could be the growth of only a few
weeks, could bear no comparison. But from the severity of that blame
which was last night so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope to be in the future secured, when the following
account of my actions and their motives has been read. If, in the explanation of them, which is due to myself, I am under the necessity of
relating feelings which may be offensive to yours, I can only say that
I am sorry. The necessity must be obeyed, and further apology would
be absurd.
“I had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common
with others, that Bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young
137
woman in the country. But it was not till the evening of the dance
at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment. I had often seen him in love before. At that ball, while I
had the honour of dancing with you, I was first made acquainted, by
Sir William Lucas's accidental information, that Bingley's attentions to
your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage.
He spoke of it as a certain event, of which the time alone could be undecided. From that moment I observed my friend's behaviour attentively; and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was
beyond what I had ever witnessed in him. Your sister I also watched.
Her look and manners were open, cheerful, and engaging as ever, but
without any symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained convinced
from the evening's scrutiny, that though she received his attentions
with pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment. If you have not been mistaken here, I must have been in error.
Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable.
If it be so, if I have been misled by such error to inflict pain on her, your
resentment has not been unreasonable. But I shall not scruple to assert,
that the serenity of your sister's countenance and air was such as might
have given the most acute observer a conviction that, however amiable
her temper, her heart was not likely to be easily touched. That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain—but I will venture to say
that my investigation and decisions are not usually influenced by my
hopes or fears. I did not believe her to be indifferent because I wished
it; I believed it on impartial conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason. My objections to the marriage were not merely those which I last
night acknowledged to have the utmost force of passion to put aside,
in my own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to
my friend as to me. But there were other causes of repugnance; causes
which, though still existing, and existing to an equal degree in both instances, I had myself endeavoured to forget, because they were not immediately before me. These causes must be stated, though briefly. The
situation of your mother's family, though objectionable, was nothing
in comparison to that total want of propriety so frequently, so almost
uniformly betrayed by herself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by your father. Pardon me. It pains me to offend you. But
amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations, and your
displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you consolation to
consider that, to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of
the like censure, is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your
elder sister, than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both.
138
I will only say farther that from what passed that evening, my opinion
of all parties was confirmed, and every inducement heightened which
could have led me before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed
a most unhappy connection. He left Netherfield for London, on the
day following, as you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon
returning.
“The part which I acted is now to be explained. His sisters' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our coincidence of feeling
was soon discovered, and, alike sensible that no time was to be lost in
detaching their brother, we shortly resolved on joining him directly in
London. We accordingly went—and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice. I described, and enforced them earnestly. But, however this remonstrance
might have staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose
that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been
seconded by the assurance that I hesitated not in giving, of your sister's indifference. He had before believed her to return his affection
with sincere, if not with equal regard. But Bingley has great natural
modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgement than on his
own. To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived himself, was no
very difficult point. To persuade him against returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given, was scarcely the work of a
moment. I cannot blame myself for having done thus much. There is
but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which I do not reflect
with satisfaction; it is that I condescended to adopt the measures of art
so far as to conceal from him your sister's being in town. I knew it myself, as it was known to Miss Bingley; but her brother is even yet ignorant of it. That they might have met without ill consequence is perhaps
probable; but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for
him to see her without some danger. Perhaps this concealment, this
disguise was beneath me; it is done, however, and it was done for the
best. On this subject I have nothing more to say, no other apology to offer. If I have wounded your sister's feelings, it was unknowingly done
and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally
appear insufficient, I have not yet learnt to condemn them.
“With respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having injured Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by laying before you the whole
of his connection with my family. Of what he has particularly accused
me I am ignorant; but of the truth of what I shall relate, I can summon
more than one witness of undoubted veracity.
“Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for
139
many years the management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose
good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him; and on George Wickham, who was his
godson, his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed. My father supported him at school, and afterwards at Cambridge—most important
assistance, as his own father, always poor from the extravagance of his
wife, would have been unable to give him a gentleman's education.
My father was not only fond of this young man's society, whose manner were always engaging; he had also the highest opinion of him, and
hoping the church would be his profession, intended to provide for
him in it. As for myself, it is many, many years since I first began to
think of him in a very different manner. The vicious propensities—the
want of principle, which he was careful to guard from the knowledge
of his best friend, could not escape the observation of a young man
of nearly the same age with himself, and who had opportunities of
seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr. Darcy could not have.
Here again shall give you pain—to what degree you only can tell. But
whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has created, a
suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real
character—it adds even another motive.
“My excellent father died about five years ago; and his attachment
to Mr. Wickham was to the last so steady, that in his will he particularly
recommended it to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner
that his profession might allow—and if he took orders, desired that a
valuable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant. There
was also a legacy of one thousand pounds. His own father did not
long survive mine, and within half a year from these events, Mr. Wickham wrote to inform me that, having finally resolved against taking
orders, he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect
some more immediate pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment,
by which he could not be benefited. He had some intention, he added,
of studying law, and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand
pounds would be a very insufficient support therein. I rather wished,
than believed him to be sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready
to accede to his proposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be
a clergyman; the business was therefore soon settled—he resigned all
claim to assistance in the church, were it possible that he could ever
be in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return three thousand
pounds. All connection between us seemed now dissolved. I thought
too ill of him to invite him to Pemberley, or admit his society in town.
In town I believe he chiefly lived, but his studying the law was a mere
140
pretence, and being now free from all restraint, his life was a life of
idleness and dissipation. For about three years I heard little of him;
but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied to me again by letter for the presentation.
His circumstances, he assured me, and I had no difficulty in believing
it, were exceedingly bad. He had found the law a most unprofitable
study, and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would
present him to the living in question—of which he trusted there could
be little doubt, as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for, and I could not have forgotten my revered father's intentions.
You will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or
for resisting every repetition to it. His resentment was in proportion
to the distress of his circumstances—and he was doubtless as violent
in his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself. After this
period every appearance of acquaintance was dropped. How he lived
I know not. But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on
my notice.
“I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being. Having said thus much, I feel
no doubt of your secrecy. My sister, who is more than ten years my
junior, was left to the guardianship of my mother's nephew, Colonel
Fitzwilliam, and myself. About a year ago, she was taken from school,
and an establishment formed for her in London; and last summer she
went with the lady who presided over it, to Ramsgate; and thither also
went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there proved to have
been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs. Younge, in whose
character we were most unhappily deceived; and by her connivance
and aid, he so far recommended himself to Georgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a
child, that she was persuaded to believe herself in love, and to consent
to an elopement. She was then but fifteen, which must be her excuse;
and after stating her imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the
knowledge of it to herself. I joined them unexpectedly a day or two
before the intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support
the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked
up to as a father, acknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine
what I felt and how I acted. Regard for my sister's credit and feelings
prevented any public exposure; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left
the place immediately, and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from
her charge. Mr. Wickham's chief object was unquestionably my sister's
141
fortune, which is thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing
that the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inducement.
His revenge would have been complete indeed.
“This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we
have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject it
as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards Mr.
Wickham. I know not in what manner, under what form of falsehood
he had imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered
at. Ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either,
detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly not in
your inclination.
“You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night;
but I was not then master enough of myself to know what could or
ought to be revealed. For the truth of everything here related, I can
appeal more particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who,
from our near relationship and constant intimacy, and, still more, as
one of the executors of my father's will, has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions. If your abhorrence of me should make my assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there
may be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find some
opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the
morning. I will only add, God bless you.
“Fitzwilliam Darcy”
Chapter 36
If Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it
to contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at
all of its contents. But such as they were, it may well be supposed
how eagerly she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited. Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined.
With amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology
to be in his power; and steadfastly was she persuaded, that he could
have no explanation to give, which a just sense of shame would not
conceal. With a strong prejudice against everything he might say, she
began his account of what had happened at Netherfield. She read with
an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension, and from
impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes. His belief
142
of her sister's insensibility she instantly resolved to be false; and his
account of the real, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice. He expressed no regret for
what he had done which satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but
haughty. It was all pride and insolence.
But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr.
Wickham—when she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation
of events which, if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of
his worth, and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history
of himself—her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition. Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her. She wished to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, “This must be false! This cannot be! This must be the grossest
falsehood!”—and when she had gone through the whole letter, though
scarcely knowing anything of the last page or two, put it hastily away,
protesting that she would not regard it, that she would never look in it
again.
In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on
nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she
again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and
commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence. The account of his connection with the Pemberley family was
exactly what he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr.
Darcy, though she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well
with his own words. So far each recital confirmed the other; but when
she came to the will, the difference was great. What Wickham had
said of the living was fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very
words, it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on
one side or the other; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that
her wishes did not err. But when she read and re-read with the closest
attention, the particulars immediately following of Wickham's resigning all pretensions to the living, of his receiving in lieu so considerable
a sum as three thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate. She
put down the letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant
to be impartiality—deliberated on the probability of each statement—
but with little success. On both sides it was only assertion. Again she
read on; but every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she
had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as
to render Mr. Darcy's conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of
a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.
143
The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to
lay at Mr. Wickham's charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as
she could bring no proof of its injustice. She had never heard of him
before his entrance into the ——shire Militia, in which he had engaged
at the persuasion of the young man who, on meeting him accidentally
in town, had there renewed a slight acquaintance. Of his former way
of life nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself. As to his real character, had information been in her power, she
had never felt a wish of inquiring. His countenance, voice, and manner
had established him at once in the possession of every virtue. She tried
to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr.
Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those casual
errors under which she would endeavour to class what Mr. Darcy had
described as the idleness and vice of many years' continuance. But
no such recollection befriended her. She could see him instantly before her, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember
no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and the regard which his social powers had gained him in
the mess. After pausing on this point a considerable while, she once
more continued to read. But, alas! the story which followed, of his
designs on Miss Darcy, received some confirmation from what had
passed between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to
Colonel Fitzwilliam himself—from whom she had previously received
the information of his near concern in all his cousin's affairs, and whose
character she had no reason to question. At one time she had almost
resolved on applying to him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal, if
he had not been well assured of his cousin's corroboration.
She perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation between Wickham and herself, in their first evening at Mr.
Phillips's. Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory.
She was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to
a stranger, and wondered it had escaped her before. She saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct. She remembered that he
had boasted of having no fear of seeing Mr. Darcy—that Mr. Darcy
might leave the country, but that he should stand his ground; yet he
had avoided the Netherfield ball the very next week. She remembered
144
also that, till the Netherfield family had quitted the country, he had
told his story to no one but herself; but that after their removal it had
been everywhere discussed; that he had then no reserves, no scruples
in sinking Mr. Darcy's character, though he had assured her that respect for the father would always prevent his exposing the son.
How differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned! His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of
views solely and hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness
to grasp at anything. His behaviour to herself could now have had
no tolerable motive; he had either been deceived with regard to her
fortune, or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shown. Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter; and in farther
justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not but allow Mr. Bingley, when
questioned by Jane, had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as were his manners, she had never, in
the whole course of their acquaintance—an acquaintance which had
latterly brought them much together, and given her a sort of intimacy
with his ways—seen anything that betrayed him to be unprincipled or
unjust—anything that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits; that
among his own connections he was esteemed and valued—that even
Wickham had allowed him merit as a brother, and that she had often
heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable
of some amiable feeling; that had his actions been what Mr. Wickham
represented them, so gross a violation of everything right could hardly
have been concealed from the world; and that friendship between a
person capable of it, and such an amiable man as Mr. Bingley, was incomprehensible.
She grew absolutely ashamed of herself. Of neither Darcy nor Wickham could she think without feeling she had been blind, partial, prejudiced, absurd.
“How despicably I have acted!” she cried; “I, who have prided myself on my discernment! I, who have valued myself on my abilities!
who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable mistrust! How humiliating is
this discovery! Yet, how just a humiliation! Had I been in love, I could
not have been more wretchedly blind! But vanity, not love, has been
my folly. Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have
courted prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where
145
either were concerned. Till this moment I never knew myself.”
From herself to Jane—from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a
line which soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy's explanation there had appeared very insufficient, and she read it again. Widely
different was the effect of a second perusal. How could she deny that
credit to his assertions in one instance, which she had been obliged to
give in the other? He declared himself to be totally unsuspicious of her
sister's attachment; and she could not help remembering what Charlotte's opinion had always been. Neither could she deny the justice
of his description of Jane. She felt that Jane's feelings, though fervent,
were little displayed, and that there was a constant complacency in her
air and manner not often united with great sensibility.
When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were
mentioned in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her sense
of shame was severe. The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly
for denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as
having passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind
than on hers.
The compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt. It soothed,
but it could not console her for the contempt which had thus been selfattracted by the rest of her family; and as she considered that Jane's
disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations, and
reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond anything she had ever
known before.
After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every
variety of thought—re-considering events, determining probabilities,
and reconciling herself, as well as she could, to a change so sudden
and so important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made
her at length return home; and she entered the house with the wish
of appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such
reflections as must make her unfit for conversation.
She was immediately told that the two gentlemen from Rosings had
each called during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few minutes, to
take leave—but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them
at least an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk
after her till she could be found. Elizabeth could but just affect concern
in missing him; she really rejoiced at it. Colonel Fitzwilliam was no
longer an object; she could think only of her letter.
146
Chapter 37
The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning, and Mr. Collins
having been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of their appearing in very good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected,
after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings. To Rosings he then hastened, to console Lady Catherine and her daughter;
and on his return brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from
her ladyship, importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very
desirous of having them all to dine with her.
Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that,
had she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her as
her future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her ladyship's indignation would have been. “What would she have said? how
would she have behaved?” were questions with which she amused
herself.
Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party. “I assure
you, I feel it exceedingly,” said Lady Catherine; “I believe no one feels
the loss of friends so much as I do. But I am particularly attached to
these young men, and know them to be so much attached to me! They
were excessively sorry to go! But so they always are. The dear Colonel
rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy seemed to feel it
most acutely, more, I think, than last year. His attachment to Rosings
certainly increases.”
Mr. Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here,
which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.
Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed
out of spirits, and immediately accounting for it by herself, by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon, she added:
“But if that is the case, you must write to your mother and beg that
you may stay a little longer. Mrs. Collins will be very glad of your
company, I am sure.”
“I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation,”
replied Elizabeth, “but it is not in my power to accept it. I must be
in town next Saturday.”
“Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks. I expected you to stay two months. I told Mrs. Collins so before you came.
There can be no occasion for your going so soon. Mrs. Bennet could
certainly spare you for another fortnight.”
“But my father cannot. He wrote last week to hurry my return.”
147
“Oh! your father of course may spare you, if your mother can.
Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father. And if you
will stay another month complete, it will be in my power to take one
of you as far as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week;
and as Dawson does not object to the barouche-box, there will be very
good room for one of you—and indeed, if the weather should happen
to be cool, I should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of
you large.”
“You are all kindness, madam; but I believe we must abide by our
original plan.”
Lady Catherine seemed resigned. “Mrs. Collins, you must send a
servant with them. You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot
bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves. It
is highly improper. You must contrive to send somebody. I have the
greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing. Young women should
always be properly guarded and attended, according to their situation
in life. When my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I
made a point of her having two men-servants go with her. Miss Darcy,
the daughter of Mr. Darcy, of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not
have appeared with propriety in a different manner. I am excessively
attentive to all those things. You must send John with the young ladies,
Mrs. Collins. I am glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would
really be discreditable to you to let them go alone.”
“My uncle is to send a servant for us.”
“Oh! Your uncle! He keeps a man-servant, does he? I am very
glad you have somebody who thinks of these things. Where shall you
change horses? Oh! Bromley, of course. If you mention my name at
the Bell, you will be attended to.”
Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their
journey, and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary, which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so
occupied, she might have forgotten where she was. Reflection must be
reserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to it
as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary walk, in
which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections.
Mr. Darcy's letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart.
She studied every sentence; and her feelings towards its writer were at
times widely different. When she remembered the style of his address,
she was still full of indignation; but when she considered how unjustly
she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against
herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compas148
sion. His attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect;
but she could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her
refusal, or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again. In her
own past behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in the unhappy defects of her family, a subject of yet heavier
chagrin. They were hopeless of remedy. Her father, contented with
laughing at them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far
from right herself, was entirely insensible of the evil. Elizabeth had frequently united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of
Catherine and Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother's
indulgence, what chance could there be of improvement? Catherine,
weak-spirited, irritable, and completely under Lydia's guidance, had
been always affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would scarcely give them a hearing. They were ignorant, idle, and
vain. While there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him;
and while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be
going there forever.
Anxiety on Jane's behalf was another prevailing concern; and Mr.
Darcy's explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion, heightened the sense of what Jane had lost. His affection was
proved to have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend.
How grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in
every respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness,
Jane had been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family!
When to these recollections was added the development of Wickham's character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which
had seldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to
make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.
Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last
week of her stay as they had been at first. The very last evening was
spent there; and her ladyship again inquired minutely into the particulars of their journey, gave them directions as to the best method of
packing, and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the
only right way, that Maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to
undo all the work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.
When they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension,
wished them a good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford
again next year; and Miss de Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both.
149
Chapter 38
On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a
few minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity
of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.
“I know not, Miss Elizabeth,” said he, “whether Mrs. Collins has
yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us; but I am
very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks
for it. The favor of your company has been much felt, I assure you. We
know how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode. Our
plain manner of living, our small rooms and few domestics, and the
little we see of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a
young lady like yourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for
the condescension, and that we have done everything in our power to
prevent your spending your time unpleasantly.”
Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness.
She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of
being with Charlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must
make her feel the obliged. Mr. Collins was gratified, and with a more
smiling solemnity replied:
“It gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed your time
not disagreeably. We have certainly done our best; and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society,
and, from our connection with Rosings, the frequent means of varying the humble home scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that your
Hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome. Our situation with
regard to Lady Catherine's family is indeed the sort of extraordinary
advantage and blessing which few can boast. You see on what a footing we are. You see how continually we are engaged there. In truth I
must acknowledge that, with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage, I should not think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion,
while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings.”
Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was
obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civility
and truth in a few short sentences.
“You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into Hertfordshire, my dear cousin. I flatter myself at least that you will be able
to do so. Lady Catherine's great attentions to Mrs. Collins you have
been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear that
your friend has drawn an unfortunate—but on this point it will be as
150
well to be silent. Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that
I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage.
My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking.
There is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of character and
ideas between us. We seem to have been designed for each other.”
Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that
was the case, and with equal sincerity could add, that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts. She was not sorry, however, to have the recital of them interrupted by the lady from whom
they sprang. Poor Charlotte! it was melancholy to leave her to such society! But she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently
regretting that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for compassion. Her home and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry,
and all their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms.
At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the
parcels placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready. After an
affectionate parting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the
carriage by Mr. Collins, and as they walked down the garden he was
commissioning her with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the
winter, and his compliments to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, though unknown. He then handed her in, Maria followed, and the door was
on the point of being closed, when he suddenly reminded them, with
some consternation, that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies at Rosings.
“But,” he added, “you will of course wish to have your humble
respects delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness
to you while you have been here.”
Elizabeth made no objection; the door was then allowed to be shut,
and the carriage drove off.
“Good gracious!” cried Maria, after a few minutes' silence, “it
seems but a day or two since we first came! and yet how many things
have happened!”
“A great many indeed,” said her companion with a sigh.
“We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there
twice! How much I shall have to tell!”
Elizabeth added privately, “And how much I shall have to conceal!”
Their journey was performed without much conversation, or any
alarm; and within four hours of their leaving Hunsford they reached
Mr. Gardiner's house, where they were to remain a few days.
Jane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying
151
her spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her
aunt had reserved for them. But Jane was to go home with her, and at
Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation.
It was not without an effort, meanwhile, that she could wait even
for Longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr. Darcy's proposals. To
know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly
astonish Jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever
of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a
temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered but the state
of indecision in which she remained as to the extent of what she should
communicate; and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being
hurried into repeating something of Bingley which might only grieve
her sister further.
Chapter 39
It was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set
out together from Gracechurch Street for the town of ——, in Hertfordshire; and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet's carriage was to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman's punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room
upstairs. These two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel
on guard, and dressing a salad and cucumber.
After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table
set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming,
“Is not this nice? Is not this an agreeable surprise?”
“And we mean to treat you all,” added Lydia, “but you must lend
us the money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there.” Then,
showing her purchases—“Look here, I have bought this bonnet. I do
not think it is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not. I
shall pull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up
any better.”
And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect
unconcern, “Oh! but there were two or three much uglier in the shop;
and when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with
fresh, I think it will be very tolerable. Besides, it will not much signify
what one wears this summer, after the ——shire have left Meryton,
and they are going in a fortnight.”
“Are they indeed!” cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.
152
“They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want
papa to take us all there for the summer! It would be such a delicious
scheme; and I dare say would hardly cost anything at all. Mamma
would like to go too of all things! Only think what a miserable summer
else we shall have!”
“Yes,” thought Elizabeth, “that would be a delightful scheme indeed, and completely do for us at once. Good Heaven! Brighton, and
a whole campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by
one poor regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton!”
“Now I have got some news for you,” said Lydia, as they sat down
at table. “What do you think? It is excellent news—capital news—and
about a certain person we all like!”
Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told he
need not stay. Lydia laughed, and said:
“Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion. You thought
the waiter must not hear, as if he cared! I dare say he often hears worse
things said than I am going to say. But he is an ugly fellow! I am glad
he is gone. I never saw such a long chin in my life. Well, but now for
my news; it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is it not?
There is no danger of Wickham's marrying Mary King. There's for you!
She is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool: gone to stay. Wickham is
safe.”
“And Mary King is safe!” added Elizabeth; “safe from a connection
imprudent as to fortune.”
“She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him.”
“But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side,” said Jane.
“I am sure there is not on his. I will answer for it, he never cared
three straws about her—who could about such a nasty little freckled
thing?”
Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such
coarseness of expression herself, the coarseness of the sentiment was little other than her own breast had harboured and fancied liberal!
As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was
ordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their
boxes, work-bags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty's
and Lydia's purchases, were seated in it.
“How nicely we are all crammed in,” cried Lydia. “I am glad I
bought my bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox!
Well, now let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all
the way home. And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to
you all since you went away. Have you seen any pleasant men? Have
153
you had any flirting? I was in great hopes that one of you would have
got a husband before you came back. Jane will be quite an old maid
soon, I declare. She is almost three-and-twenty! Lord, how ashamed
I should be of not being married before three-and-twenty! My aunt
Phillips wants you so to get husbands, you can't think. She says Lizzy
had better have taken Mr. Collins; but I do not think there would have
been any fun in it. Lord! how I should like to be married before any
of you; and then I would chaperon you about to all the balls. Dear me!
we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel Forster's.
Kitty and me were to spend the day there, and Mrs. Forster promised
to have a little dance in the evening; (by the bye, Mrs. Forster and me
are such friends!) and so she asked the two Harringtons to come, but
Harriet was ill, and so Pen was forced to come by herself; and then,
what do you think we did? We dressed up Chamberlayne in woman's
clothes on purpose to pass for a lady, only think what fun! Not a soul
knew of it, but Colonel and Mrs. Forster, and Kitty and me, except my
aunt, for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns; and you cannot
imagine how well he looked! When Denny, and Wickham, and Pratt,
and two or three more of the men came in, they did not know him in
the least. Lord! how I laughed! and so did Mrs. Forster. I thought
I should have died. And that made the men suspect something, and
then they soon found out what was the matter.”
With such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes, did
Lydia, assisted by Kitty's hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her
companions all the way to Longbourn. Elizabeth listened as little as she
could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham's
name.
Their reception at home was most kind. Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to see
Jane in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did
Mr. Bennet say voluntarily to Elizabeth:
“I am glad you are come back, Lizzy.”
Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases
came to meet Maria and hear the news; and various were the subjects
that occupied them: Lady Lucas was inquiring of Maria, after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs. Bennet was doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from
Jane, who sat some way below her, and, on the other, retailing them all
to the younger Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice rather louder than any
other person's, was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning
to anybody who would hear her.
“Oh! Mary,” said she, “I wish you had gone with us, for we had
154
such fun! As we went along, Kitty and I drew up the blinds, and pretended there was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all
the way, if Kitty had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do
think we behaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with
the nicest cold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we
would have treated you too. And then when we came away it was
such fun! I thought we never should have got into the coach. I was
ready to die of laughter. And then we were so merry all the way home!
we talked and laughed so loud, that anybody might have heard us ten
miles off!”
To this Mary very gravely replied, “Far be it from me, my dear sister, to depreciate such pleasures! They would doubtless be congenial
with the generality of female minds. But I confess they would have no
charms for me—I should infinitely prefer a book.”
But of this answer Lydia heard not a word. She seldom listened to
anybody for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at
all.
In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk
to Meryton, and to see how everybody went on; but Elizabeth steadily
opposed the scheme. It should not be said that the Miss Bennets could
not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers.
There was another reason too for her opposition. She dreaded seeing
Mr. Wickham again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible.
The comfort to her of the regiment's approaching removal was indeed
beyond expression. In a fortnight they were to go—and once gone, she
hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account.
She had not been many hours at home before she found that the
Brighton scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was
under frequent discussion between her parents. Elizabeth saw directly
that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother,
though often disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at
last.
Chapter 40
Elizabeth's impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened
could no longer be overcome; and at length, resolving to suppress
every particular in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her
to be surprised, she related to her the next morning the chief of the
155
scene between Mr. Darcy and herself.
Miss Bennet's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings. She
was sorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a
manner so little suited to recommend them; but still more was she
grieved for the unhappiness which her sister's refusal must have given
him.
“His being so sure of succeeding was wrong,” said she, “and certainly ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must
increase his disappointment!”
“Indeed,” replied Elizabeth, “I am heartily sorry for him; but he has
other feelings, which will probably soon drive away his regard for me.
You do not blame me, however, for refusing him?”
“Blame you! Oh, no.”
“But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?”
“No—I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did.”
“But you will know it, when I tell you what happened the very next
day.”
She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far
as they concerned George Wickham. What a stroke was this for poor
Jane! who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind,
as was here collected in one individual. Nor was Darcy's vindication,
though grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery. Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error,
and seek to clear the one without involving the other.
“This will not do,” said Elizabeth; “you never will be able to make
both of them good for anything. Take your choice, but you must be
satisfied with only one. There is but such a quantity of merit between
them; just enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been
shifting about pretty much. For my part, I am inclined to believe it all
Darcy's; but you shall do as you choose.”
It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from
Jane.
“I do not know when I have been more shocked,” said she. “Wickham so very bad! It is almost past belief. And poor Mr. Darcy! Dear
Lizzy, only consider what he must have suffered. Such a disappointment! and with the knowledge of your ill opinion, too! and having to
relate such a thing of his sister! It is really too distressing. I am sure
you must feel it so.”
156
“Oh! no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing
you so full of both. I know you will do him such ample justice, that
I am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent. Your
profusion makes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer,
my heart will be as light as a feather.”
“Poor Wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in his
countenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner!”
“There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education
of those two young men. One has got all the goodness, and the other
all the appearance of it.”
“I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you
used to do.”
“And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided
a dislike to him, without any reason. It is such a spur to one's genius,
such an opening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind. One may be continually abusive without saying anything just; but one cannot always
be laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something
witty.”
“Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat
the matter as you do now.”
“Indeed, I could not. I was uncomfortable enough, I may say unhappy. And with no one to speak to about what I felt, no Jane to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I had! Oh! how I wanted you!”
“How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they do appear
wholly undeserved.”
“Certainly. But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most
natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging. There
is one point on which I want your advice. I want to be told whether I
ought, or ought not, to make our acquaintances in general understand
Wickham's character.”
Miss Bennet paused a little, and then replied, “Surely there can be
no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully. What is your opinion?”
“That it ought not to be attempted. Mr. Darcy has not authorised
me to make his communication public. On the contrary, every particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to
myself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct, who will believe me? The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy is
so violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light. I am not equal to it.
157
Wickham will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to anyone here what he really is. Some time hence it will be all found out,
and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before. At
present I will say nothing about it.”
“You are quite right. To have his errors made public might ruin him
for ever. He is now, perhaps, sorry for what he has done, and anxious
to re-establish a character. We must not make him desperate.”
The tumult of Elizabeth's mind was allayed by this conversation.
She had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a
fortnight, and was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she
might wish to talk again of either. But there was still something lurking behind, of which prudence forbade the disclosure. She dared not
relate the other half of Mr. Darcy's letter, nor explain to her sister how
sincerely she had been valued by her friend. Here was knowledge in
which no one could partake; and she was sensible that nothing less
than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in
throwing off this last encumbrance of mystery. “And then,” said she,
“if that very improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely
be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner
himself. The liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all
its value!”
She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the
real state of her sister's spirits. Jane was not happy. She still cherished
a very tender affection for Bingley. Having never even fancied herself
in love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment, and,
from her age and disposition, greater steadiness than most first attachments often boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance,
and prefer him to every other man, that all her good sense, and all her
attention to the feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own
health and their tranquillity.
“Well, Lizzy,” said Mrs. Bennet one day, “what is your opinion now
of this sad business of Jane's? For my part, I am determined never to
speak of it again to anybody. I told my sister Phillips so the other day.
But I cannot find out that Jane saw anything of him in London. Well,
he is a very undeserving young man—and I do not suppose there's the
least chance in the world of her ever getting him now. There is no talk
of his coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have inquired
of everybody, too, who is likely to know.”
“I do not believe he will ever live at Netherfield any more.”
“Oh well! it is just as he chooses. Nobody wants him to come.
158
Though I shall always say he used my daughter extremely ill; and if
I was her, I would not have put up with it. Well, my comfort is, I am
sure Jane will die of a broken heart; and then he will be sorry for what
he has done.”
But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation, she made no answer.
“Well, Lizzy,” continued her mother, soon afterwards, “and so the
Collinses live very comfortable, do they? Well, well, I only hope it will
last. And what sort of table do they keep? Charlotte is an excellent
manager, I dare say. If she is half as sharp as her mother, she is saving
enough. There is nothing extravagant in their housekeeping, I dare
say.”
“No, nothing at all.”
“A great deal of good management, depend upon it. Yes, yes. they
will take care not to outrun their income. They will never be distressed
for money. Well, much good may it do them! And so, I suppose, they
often talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead. They look
upon it as quite their own, I dare say, whenever that happens.”
“It was a subject which they could not mention before me.”
“No; it would have been strange if they had; but I make no doubt
they often talk of it between themselves. Well, if they can be easy with
an estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better. I should be
ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me.”
Chapter 41
The first week of their return was soon gone. The second began. It
was the last of the regiment's stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies
in the neighbourhood were drooping apace. The dejection was almost
universal. The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink,
and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments. Very
frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and Lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend
such hard-heartedness in any of the family.
“Good Heaven! what is to become of us? What are we to do?”
would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe. “How can you be
smiling so, Lizzy?”
Their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered
what she had herself endured on a similar occasion, five-and-twenty
years ago.
159
“I am sure,” said she, “I cried for two days together when Colonel
Miller's regiment went away. I thought I should have broken my
heart.”
“I am sure I shall break mine,” said Lydia.
“If one could but go to Brighton!” observed Mrs. Bennet.
“Oh, yes!—if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so disagreeable.”
“A little sea-bathing would set me up forever.”
“And my aunt Phillips is sure it would do me a great deal of good,”
added Kitty.
Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually
through Longbourn House. Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them;
but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame. She felt anew the justice of
Mr. Darcy's objections; and never had she been so much disposed to
pardon his interference in the views of his friend.
But the gloom of Lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away; for
she received an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the colonel of
the regiment, to accompany her to Brighton. This invaluable friend
was a very young woman, and very lately married. A resemblance
in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to
each other, and out of their three months' acquaintance they had been
intimate two.
The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs. Forster,
the delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely
to be described. Wholly inattentive to her sister's feelings, Lydia flew
about the house in restless ecstasy, calling for everyone's congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever; whilst
the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repined at her fate in terms
as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.
“I cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask me as well as Lydia,”
said she, “Though I am not her particular friend. I have just as much
right to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older.”
In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to
make her resigned. As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far
from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that
she considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common
sense for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were
it known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her
go. She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia's general behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of
such a woman as Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet
160
more imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must be greater than at home. He heard her attentively, and
then said:
“Lydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some
public place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little
expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances.”
“If you were aware,” said Elizabeth, “of the very great disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of Lydia's unguarded and imprudent manner—nay, which has already arisen from
it, I am sure you would judge differently in the affair.”
“Already arisen?” repeated Mr. Bennet. “What, has she frightened
away some of your lovers? Poor little Lizzy! But do not be cast down.
Such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little
absurdity are not worth a regret. Come, let me see the list of pitiful
fellows who have been kept aloof by Lydia's folly.”
“Indeed you are mistaken. I have no such injuries to resent. It is not
of particular, but of general evils, which I am now complaining. Our
importance, our respectability in the world must be affected by the
wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark
Lydia's character. Excuse me, for I must speak plainly. If you, my dear
father, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and
of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of
her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment. Her character will be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt
that ever made herself or her family ridiculous; a flirt, too, in the worst
and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond youth
and a tolerable person; and, from the ignorance and emptiness of her
mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite. In this danger Kitty
also is comprehended. She will follow wherever Lydia leads. Vain, ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled! Oh! my dear father, can you
suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in
the disgrace?”
Mr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject, and affectionately taking her hand said in reply:
“Do not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever you and Jane are
known you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to
less advantage for having a couple of—or I may say, three—very silly
sisters. We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to
161
Brighton. Let her go, then. Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will
keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an
object of prey to anybody. At Brighton she will be of less importance
even as a common flirt than she has been here. The officers will find
women better worth their notice. Let us hope, therefore, that her being
there may teach her her own insignificance. At any rate, she cannot
grow many degrees worse, without authorising us to lock her up for
the rest of her life.”
With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own
opinion continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry.
It was not in her nature, however, to increase her vexations by dwelling
on them. She was confident of having performed her duty, and to fret
over unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her
disposition.
Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference
with her father, their indignation would hardly have found expression
in their united volubility. In Lydia's imagination, a visit to Brighton
comprised every possibility of earthly happiness. She saw, with the
creative eye of fancy, the streets of that gay bathing-place covered with
officers. She saw herself the object of attention, to tens and to scores
of them at present unknown. She saw all the glories of the camp—its
tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with
the young and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to complete the
view, she saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at
least six officers at once.
Had she known her sister sought to tear her from such prospects
and such realities as these, what would have been her sensations? They
could have been understood only by her mother, who might have felt
nearly the same. Lydia's going to Brighton was all that consoled her
for her melancholy conviction of her husband's never intending to go
there himself.
But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures continued, with little intermission, to the very day of Lydia's
leaving home.
Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time. Having
been frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was
pretty well over; the agitations of formal partiality entirely so. She had
even learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted
her, an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary. In his present
behaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure,
for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those intentions which
162
had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve, after
what had since passed, to provoke her. She lost all concern for him
in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous
gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the
reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be
gratified, and her preference secured at any time by their renewal.
On the very last day of the regiment's remaining at Meryton, he
dined, with other of the officers, at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making some inquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at
Hunsford, she mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam's and Mr. Darcy's having both spent three weeks at Rosings, and asked him, if he was acquainted with the former.
He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment's
recollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen
him often; and, after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man,
asked her how she had liked him. Her answer was warmly in his
favour. With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added:
“How long did you say he was at Rosings?”
“Nearly three weeks.”
“And you saw him frequently?”
“Yes, almost every day.”
“His manners are very different from his cousin's.”
“Yes, very different. But I think Mr. Darcy improves upon acquaintance.”
“Indeed!” cried Mr. Wickham with a look which did not escape her.
“And pray, may I ask?—” But checking himself, he added, in a gayer
tone, “Is it in address that he improves? Has he deigned to add aught
of civility to his ordinary style?—for I dare not hope,” he continued in
a lower and more serious tone, “that he is improved in essentials.”
“Oh, no!” said Elizabeth. “In essentials, I believe, he is very much
what he ever was.”
While she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether
to rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning. There was a
something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention, while she added:
“When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean
that his mind or his manners were in a state of improvement, but that,
from knowing him better, his disposition was better understood.”
Wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and
163
agitated look; for a few minutes he was silent, till, shaking off his embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of accents:
“You, who so well know my feeling towards Mr. Darcy, will readily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to
assume even the appearance of what is right. His pride, in that direction, may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must
only deter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by. I only
fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you, I imagine, have been
alluding, is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good
opinion and judgement he stands much in awe. His fear of her has always operated, I know, when they were together; and a good deal is to
be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh,
which I am certain he has very much at heart.”
Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only
by a slight inclination of the head. She saw that he wanted to engage
her on the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to
indulge him. The rest of the evening passed with the appearance, on his
side, of usual cheerfulness, but with no further attempt to distinguish
Elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a
mutual desire of never meeting again.
When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to
Meryton, from whence they were to set out early the next morning. The
separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic.
Kitty was the only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation
and envy. Mrs. Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity
of her daughter, and impressive in her injunctions that she should not
miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible—advice
which there was every reason to believe would be well attended to;
and in the clamorous happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell,
the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard.
Chapter 42
Had Elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family, she
could not have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal felicity or
domestic comfort. Her father, captivated by youth and beauty, and
that appearance of good humour which youth and beauty generally
give, had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal
mind had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for
her. Respect, esteem, and confidence had vanished for ever; and all his
164
views of domestic happiness were overthrown. But Mr. Bennet was not
of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own
imprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often
console the unfortunate for their folly of their vice. He was fond of the
country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal
enjoyments. To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than as
her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement. This is not
the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his
wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true
philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.
Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her
father's behaviour as a husband. She had always seen it with pain;
but respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment
of herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and
to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her
own children, was so highly reprehensible. But she had never felt so
strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of
so unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents, which, rightly used,
might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even
if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.
When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham's departure she found
little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment. Their
parties abroad were less varied than before, and at home she had a
mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dullness of everything around them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and,
though Kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since
the disturbers of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose
disposition greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a watering-place and a camp. Upon the whole, therefore, she
found, what has been sometimes been found before, that an event to
which she had been looking with impatient desire did not, in taking
place, bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself. It was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement
of actual felicity—to have some other point on which her wishes and
hopes might be fixed, and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the present, and prepare for another disappointment. Her tour to the Lakes was now the object of her happiest
thoughts; it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours
165
which the discontentedness of her mother and Kitty made inevitable;
and could she have included Jane in the scheme, every part of it would
have been perfect.
“But it is fortunate,” thought she, “that I have something to wish
for. Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would
be certain. But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret
in my sister's absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realised. A scheme of which every part promises
delight can never be successful; and general disappointment is only
warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation.”
When Lydia went away she promised to write very often and very
minutely to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and always very short. Those to her mother contained little
else than that they were just returned from the library, where such and
such officers had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or
a new parasol, which she would have described more fully, but was
obliged to leave off in a violent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, and
they were going off to the camp; and from her correspondence with her
sister, there was still less to be learnt—for her letters to Kitty, though
rather longer, were much too full of lines under the words to be made
public.
After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good
humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn. Everything wore a happier aspect. The families who had been in town for
the winter came back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose. Mrs. Bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity;
and, by the middle of June, Kitty was so much recovered as to be able
to enter Meryton without tears; an event of such happy promise as
to make Elizabeth hope that by the following Christmas she might be
so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day,
unless, by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the War Office,
another regiment should be quartered in Meryton.
The time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now
fast approaching, and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter
arrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement
and curtailed its extent. Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by business
from setting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London
again within a month, and as that left too short a period for them to go
so far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with
the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up
166
the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour, and, according to the
present plan, were to go no farther northwards than Derbyshire. In that
county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three
weeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction. The
town where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where
they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object
of her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth,
Dovedale, or the Peak.
Elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on
seeing the Lakes, and still thought there might have been time enough.
But it was her business to be satisfied—and certainly her temper to be
happy; and all was soon right again.
With the mention of Derbyshire there were many ideas connected.
It was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its owner. “But surely,” said she, “I may enter his county without impunity, and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving
me.”
The period of expectation was now doubled. Four weeks were to
pass away before her uncle and aunt's arrival. But they did pass away,
and Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at Longbourn. The children, two girls of six and eight years old,
and two younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their
cousin Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense
and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in
every way—teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.
The Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off
the next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement. One enjoyment was certain—that of suitableness of companions; a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear
inconveniences—cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure—and affection and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there
were disappointments abroad.
It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire,
nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither
lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth, Birmingham, etc. are
sufficiently known. A small part of Derbyshire is all the present concern. To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner's former residence, and where she had lately learned some acquaintance
still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen all the principal
wonders of the country; and within five miles of Lambton, Elizabeth
found from her aunt that Pemberley was situated. It was not in their
167
direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it. In talking over their
route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner expressed an inclination to see
the place again. Mr. Gardiner declared his willingness, and Elizabeth
was applied to for her approbation.
“My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have
heard so much?” said her aunt; “a place, too, with which so many
of your acquaintances are connected. Wickham passed all his youth
there, you know.”
Elizabeth was distressed. She felt that she had no business at Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it. She
must own that she was tired of seeing great houses; after going over so
many, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.
Mrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity. “If it were merely a fine house
richly furnished,” said she, “I should not care about it myself; but the
grounds are delightful. They have some of the finest woods in the
country.”
Elizabeth said no more—but her mind could not acquiesce. The
possibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly occurred. It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very idea, and thought
it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such a risk.
But against this there were objections; and she finally resolved that it
could be the last resource, if her private inquiries to the absence of the
family were unfavourably answered.
Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid
whether Pemberley were not a very fine place? what was the name
of its proprietor? and, with no little alarm, whether the family were
down for the summer? A most welcome negative followed the last
question—and her alarms now being removed, she was at leisure to
feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself; and when the
subject was revived the next morning, and she was again applied to,
could readily answer, and with a proper air of indifference, that she
had not really any dislike to the scheme. To Pemberley, therefore, they
were to go.
Chapter 43
Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of
Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they
turned in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.
The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground.
168
They entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time
through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.
Elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and
admired every remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually
ascended for half-a-mile, and then found themselves at the top of a
considerable eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of
a valley, into which the road with some abruptness wound. It was a
large, handsome stone building, standing well on rising ground, and
backed by a ridge of high woody hills; and in front, a stream of some
natural importance was swelled into greater, but without any artificial
appearance. Its banks were neither formal nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She had never seen a place for which nature had
done more, or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by
an awkward taste. They were all of them warm in their admiration;
and at that moment she felt that to be mistress of Pemberley might be
something!
They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door;
and, while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehension of meeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest the chambermaid
had been mistaken. On applying to see the place, they were admitted
into the hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had
leisure to wonder at her being where she was.
The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking elderly woman,
much less fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her.
They followed her into the dining-parlour. It was a large, well proportioned room, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went to a window to enjoy its prospect. The hill, crowned
with wood, which they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the distance, was a beautiful object. Every disposition of
the ground was good; and she looked on the whole scene, the river,
the trees scattered on its banks and the winding of the valley, as far
as she could trace it, with delight. As they passed into other rooms
these objects were taking different positions; but from every window
there were beauties to be seen. The rooms were lofty and handsome,
and their furniture suitable to the fortune of its proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor
uselessly fine; with less of splendour, and more real elegance, than the
furniture of Rosings.
“And of this place,” thought she, “I might have been mistress! With
these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted! Instead
169
of viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my
own, and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt. But no,”—
recollecting herself—“that could never be; my uncle and aunt would
have been lost to me; I should not have been allowed to invite them.”
This was a lucky recollection—it saved her from something very
like regret.
She longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master was
really absent, but had not the courage for it. At length however, the
question was asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm,
while Mrs. Reynolds replied that he was, adding, “But we expect him
to-morrow, with a large party of friends.” How rejoiced was Elizabeth
that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a
day!
Her aunt now called her to look at a picture. She approached and
saw the likeness of Mr. Wickham, suspended, amongst several other
miniatures, over the mantelpiece. Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how
she liked it. The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was a
picture of a young gentleman, the son of her late master's steward,
who had been brought up by him at his own expense. “He is now
gone into the army,” she added; “but I am afraid he has turned out
very wild.”
Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could
not return it.
“And that,” said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures, “is my master—and very like him. It was drawn at the same time
as the other—about eight years ago.”
“I have heard much of your master's fine person,” said Mrs. Gardiner, looking at the picture; “it is a handsome face. But, Lizzy, you can
tell us whether it is like or not.”
Mrs. Reynolds respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master.
“Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?”
Elizabeth coloured, and said: “A little.”
“And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma'am?”
“Yes, very handsome.”
“I am sure I know none so handsome; but in the gallery upstairs
you will see a finer, larger picture of him than this. This room was my
late master's favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used
to be then. He was very fond of them.”
This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham's being among them.
Mrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy,
170
drawn when she was only eight years old.
“And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?” said Mrs. Gardiner.
“Oh! yes—the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so
accomplished!—She plays and sings all day long. In the next room is
a new instrument just come down for her—a present from my master;
she comes here to-morrow with him.”
Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were very easy and pleasant, encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks; Mrs.
Reynolds, either by pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure
in talking of her master and his sister.
“Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?”
“Not so much as I could wish, sir; but I dare say he may spend half
his time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months.”
“Except,” thought Elizabeth, “when she goes to Ramsgate.”
“If your master would marry, you might see more of him.”
“Yes, sir; but I do not know when that will be. I do not know who
is good enough for him.”
Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could not help saying, “It
is very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so.”
“I say no more than the truth, and everybody will say that knows
him,” replied the other. Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far;
and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper
added, “I have never known a cross word from him in my life, and
I have known him ever since he was four years old.”
This was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite
to her ideas. That he was not a good-tempered man had been her
firmest opinion. Her keenest attention was awakened; she longed to
hear more, and was grateful to her uncle for saying:
“There are very few people of whom so much can be said. You are
lucky in having such a master.”
“Yes, sir, I know I am. If I were to go through the world, I could
not meet with a better. But I have always observed, that they who are
good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up;
and he was always the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted boy
in the world.”
Elizabeth almost stared at her. “Can this be Mr. Darcy?” thought
she.
“His father was an excellent man,” said Mrs. Gardiner.
“Yes, ma'am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him—
just as affable to the poor.”
171
Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for
more. Mrs. Reynolds could interest her on no other point. She related
the subjects of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price
of the furniture, in vain, Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of
family prejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation
of her master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy
on his many merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase.
“He is the best landlord, and the best master,” said she, “that ever
lived; not like the wild young men nowadays, who think of nothing
but themselves. There is not one of his tenants or servants but will
give him a good name. Some people call him proud; but I am sure I
never saw anything of it. To my fancy, it is only because he does not
rattle away like other young men.”
“In what an amiable light does this place him!” thought Elizabeth.
“This fine account of him,” whispered her aunt as they walked, “is
not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.”
“Perhaps we might be deceived.”
“That is not very likely; our authority was too good.”
On reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very
pretty sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below; and were informed that it was but
just done to give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the
room when last at Pemberley.
“He is certainly a good brother,” said Elizabeth, as she walked towards one of the windows.
Mrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy's delight, when she should
enter the room. “And this is always the way with him,” she added.
“Whatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment. There is nothing he would not do for her.”
The picture-gallery, and two or three of the principal bedrooms,
were all that remained to be shown. In the former were many good
paintings; but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as
had been already visible below, she had willingly turned to look at
some drawings of Miss Darcy's, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and also more intelligible.
In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have
little to fix the attention of a stranger. Elizabeth walked in quest of
the only face whose features would be known to her. At last it arrested her—and she beheld a striking resemblance to Mr. Darcy, with
such a smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen
when he looked at her. She stood several minutes before the picture,
172
in earnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted
the gallery. Mrs. Reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his
father's lifetime.
There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth's mind, a more
gentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt at the
height of their acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on him by
Mrs. Reynolds was of no trifling nature. What praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant? As a brother, a landlord,
a master, she considered how many people's happiness were in his
guardianship!—how much of pleasure or pain was it in his power to
bestow!—how much of good or evil must be done by him! Every idea
that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to
his character, and as she stood before the canvas on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes upon herself, she thought of his regard
with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before; she
remembered its warmth, and softened its impropriety of expression.
When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been
seen, they returned downstairs, and, taking leave of the housekeeper,
were consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall-door.
As they walked across the hall towards the river, Elizabeth turned
back to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the
former was conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it
himself suddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to
the stables.
They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was
his appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. Their eyes
instantly met, and the cheeks of both were overspread with the deepest
blush. He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immovable
from surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the
party, and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at
least of perfect civility.
She had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach,
received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be
overcome. Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture
they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two
that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener's expression of surprise,
on beholding his master, must immediately have told it. They stood
a little aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and
confused, scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what
answer she returned to his civil inquiries after her family. Amazed at
the alteration of his manner since they last parted, every sentence that
173
he uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the
impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind, the few
minutes in which they continued were some of the most uncomfortable in her life. Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he spoke, his
accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his inquiries
as to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her having stayed
in Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the
distraction of his thoughts.
At length every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few
moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and
took leave.
The others then joined her, and expressed admiration of his figure;
but Elizabeth heard not a word, and wholly engrossed by her own feelings, followed them in silence. She was overpowered by shame and
vexation. Her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most illjudged thing in the world! How strange it must appear to him! In
what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man! It might
seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again! Oh!
why did she come? Or, why did he thus come a day before he was
expected? Had they been only ten minutes sooner, they should have
been beyond the reach of his discrimination; for it was plain that he
was that moment arrived—that moment alighted from his horse or
his carriage. She blushed again and again over the perverseness of
the meeting. And his behaviour, so strikingly altered—what could it
mean? That he should even speak to her was amazing!—but to speak
with such civility, to inquire after her family! Never in her life had she
seen his manners so little dignified, never had he spoken with such
gentleness as on this unexpected meeting. What a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park, when he put his letter into her
hand! She knew not what to think, or how to account for it.
They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water,
and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer
reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some
time before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt,
and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she
distinguished no part of the scene. Her thoughts were all fixed on that
one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy
then was. She longed to know what at the moment was passing in
his mind—in what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance
of everything, she was still dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil
174
only because he felt himself at ease; yet there had been that in his voice
which was not like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her
with composure.
At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence
of mind aroused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like
herself.
They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while,
ascended some of the higher grounds; when, in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming
views of the valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods
overspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream. Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park, but feared it
might be beyond a walk. With a triumphant smile they were told that
it was ten miles round. It settled the matter; and they pursued the
accustomed circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a
descent among hanging woods, to the edge of the water, and one of
its narrowest parts. They crossed it by a simple bridge, in character
with the general air of the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any
they had yet visited; and the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed
room only for the stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppicewood which bordered it. Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but
when they had crossed the bridge, and perceived their distance from
the house, Mrs. Gardiner, who was not a great walker, could go no
farther, and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was, therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their
way towards the house on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest
direction; but their progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom
able to indulge the taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much
engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the
water, and talking to the man about them, that he advanced but little.
Whilst wandering on in this slow manner, they were again surprised,
and Elizabeth's astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at
first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy approaching them, and at no great distance. The walk here being here less sheltered than on the other side,
allowed them to see him before they met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an interview than before, and
resolved to appear and to speak with calmness, if he really intended to
meet them. For a few moments, indeed, she felt that he would probably strike into some other path. The idea lasted while a turning in
the walk concealed him from their view; the turning past, he was im175
mediately before them. With a glance, she saw that he had lost none
of his recent civility; and, to imitate his politeness, she began, as they
met, to admire the beauty of the place; but she had not got beyond the
words “delightful,” and “charming,” when some unlucky recollections
obtruded, and she fancied that praise of Pemberley from her might be
mischievously construed. Her colour changed, and she said no more.
Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he
asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her
friends. This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking
the acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride
had revolted in his offer to herself. “What will be his surprise,” thought
she, “when he knows who they are? He takes them now for people of
fashion.”
The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she
named their relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see
how he bore it, and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions. That he was
surprised by the connection was evident; he sustained it, however, with
fortitude, and so far from going away, turned his back with them, and
entered into conversation with Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but
be pleased, could not but triumph. It was consoling that he should
know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush.
She listened most attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked
his intelligence, his taste, or his good manners.
The conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr.
Darcy invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he
chose while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same
time to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of
the stream where there was usually most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who
was walking arm-in-arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of
wonder. Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the
compliment must be all for herself. Her astonishment, however, was
extreme, and continually was she repeating, “Why is he so altered?
From what can it proceed? It cannot be for me—it cannot be for my sake
that his manners are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could not
work such a change as this. It is impossible that he should still love
me.”
After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two
gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the
176
brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water-plant,
there chanced to be a little alteration. It originated in Mrs. Gardiner,
who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found Elizabeth's arm
inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred her husband's.
Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on together.
After a short silence, the lady first spoke. She wished him to know
that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place,
and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been very
unexpected—“for your housekeeper,” she added, “informed us that
you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before we
left Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected
in the country.” He acknowledged the truth of it all, and said that
business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few
hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling.
“They will join me early to-morrow,” he continued, “and among them
are some who will claim an acquaintance with you—Mr. Bingley and
his sisters.”
Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley's name had been the
last mentioned between them; and, if she might judge by his complexion, his mind was not very differently engaged.
“There is also one other person in the party,” he continued after a
pause, “who more particularly wishes to be known to you. Will you
allow me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton?”
The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too
great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She immediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her must be the work of her brother, and, without looking farther, it was satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her.
They now walked on in silence, each of them deep in thought. Elizabeth was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered
and pleased. His wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of the highest kind. They soon outstripped the others, and when
they had reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind.
He then asked her to walk into the house—but she declared herself
not tired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time much
might have been said, and silence was very awkward. She wanted to
talk, but there seemed to be an embargo on every subject. At last she
177
recollected that she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock
and Dove Dale with great perseverance. Yet time and her aunt moved
slowly—and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn our before
the tete-a-tete was over. On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's coming up they
were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment; but
this was declined, and they parted on each side with utmost politeness.
Mr. Darcy handed the ladies into the carriage; and when it drove off,
Elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house.
The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of
them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had
expected. “He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming,” said
her uncle.
“There is something a little stately in him, to be sure,” replied her
aunt, “but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming. I can now say
with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud, I
have seen nothing of it.”
“I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. It was
more than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for
such attention. His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling.”
“To be sure, Lizzy,” said her aunt, “he is not so handsome as Wickham; or, rather, he has not Wickham's countenance, for his features are
perfectly good. But how came you to tell me that he was so disagreeable?”
Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had
liked him better when they had met in Kent than before, and that she
had never seen him so pleasant as this morning.
“But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,” replied
her uncle. “Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him
at his word, as he might change his mind another day, and warn me
off his grounds.”
Elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his character,
but said nothing.
“From what we have seen of him,” continued Mrs. Gardiner, “I really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel
a way by anybody as he has done by poor Wickham. He has not an
ill-natured look. On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his
mouth when he speaks. And there is something of dignity in his countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart. But,
to be sure, the good lady who showed us his house did give him a most
flaming character! I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes. But
he is a liberal master, I suppose, and that in the eye of a servant com178
prehends every virtue.”
Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in as guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard
from his relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different
construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor
Wickham's so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire.
In confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary
transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming her authority, but stating it to be such as such as might be relied
on.
Mrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now
approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to
the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing
out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of
anything else. Fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk they
had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of a intercourse renewed after many years' discontinuance.
The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do
nothing but think, and think with wonder, of Mr. Darcy's civility, and,
above all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.
Chapter 44
Elizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visit
her the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was consequently
resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning. But
her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their arrival at
Lambton, these visitors came. They had been walking about the place
with some of their new friends, and were just returning to the inn to
dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a
carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and a lady
in a curricle driving up the street. Elizabeth immediately recognizing
the livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of her
surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which
she expected. Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance
itself, and many of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to
179
them a new idea on the business. Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they felt that there was no other way of accounting for such
attentions from such a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their
niece. While these newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the
perturbation of Elizabeth's feelings was at every moment increasing.
She was quite amazed at her own discomposure; but amongst other
causes of disquiet, she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should
have said too much in her favour; and, more than commonly anxious
to please, she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would
fail her.
She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she
walked up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw
such looks of inquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse.
Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction took place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see that her new
acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself. Since her being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud;
but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was
only exceedingly shy. She found it difficult to obtain even a word from
her beyond a monosyllable.
Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and,
though little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance womanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her brother;
but there was sense and good humour in her face, and her manners
were perfectly unassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had expected to
find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy
had been, was much relieved by discerning such different feelings.
They had not long been together before Mr. Darcy told her that Bingley was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley's
quick step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the
room. All Elizabeth's anger against him had been long done away; but
had she still felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the
unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her
again. He inquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family,
and looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had
ever done.
To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself. They had long wished to see him. The whole party
before them, indeed, excited a lively attention. The suspicions which
180
had just arisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece directed their observation
towards each with an earnest though guarded inquiry; and they soon
drew from those inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least
knew what it was to love. Of the lady's sensations they remained a little in doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration
was evident enough.
Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain the
feelings of each of her visitors; she wanted to compose her own, and to
make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she feared
most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour. Bingley
was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.
In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and, oh!
how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed
in a like manner. Sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than
on former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion
that, as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance. But,
though this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival to Jane. No look
appeared on either side that spoke particular regard. Nothing occurred
between them that could justify the hopes of his sister. On this point
she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred
ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a recollection of Jane not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying
more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared. He observed
to her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and in a
tone which had something of real regret, that it “was a very long time
since he had had the pleasure of seeing her;” and, before she could reply, he added, “It is above eight months. We have not met since the
26th of November, when we were all dancing together at Netherfield.”
Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest,
whether all her sisters were at Longbourn. There was not much in the
question, nor in the preceding remark; but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning.
It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself; but, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression
of general complaisance, and in all that he said she heard an accent
so removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions, as convinced
her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its existence might prove, had at least out181
lived one day. When she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and
courting the good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few
months ago would have been a disgrace—when she saw him thus civil,
not only to herself, but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage—
the difference, the change was so great, and struck so forcibly on her
mind, that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible. Never, even in the company of his dear friends at Netherfield,
or his dignified relations at Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to
please, so free from self-consequence or unbending reserve, as now,
when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours,
and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were
addressed would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies
both of Netherfield and Rosings.
Their visitors stayed with them above half-an-hour; and when they
arose to depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to
dinner at Pemberley, before they left the country. Miss Darcy, though
with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations, readily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of
knowing how she, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed
as to its acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head. Presuming however, that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary
embarrassment than any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she
ventured to engage for her attendance, and the day after the next was
fixed on.
Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many inquiries
to make after all their Hertfordshire friends. Elizabeth, construing all
this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased, and on
this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their visitors
left them, capable of considering the last half-hour with some satisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been little.
Eager to be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from her uncle and
aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear their favourable
opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.
But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's curiosity; it
was not their wish to force her communication. It was evident that she
was much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any
idea of; it was evident that he was very much in love with her. They
182
saw much to interest, but nothing to justify inquiry.
Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as
far as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. They could
not be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn his character
from their own feelings and his servant's report, without any reference
to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known
would not have recognized it for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest,
however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible
that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four
years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to
be hastily rejected. Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of
their Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight. They had
nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not, it
would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-town
where the family did not visit. It was acknowledged, however, that he
was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.
With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not
held there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns with
the son of his patron were imperfectly understood, it was yet a wellknown fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts
behind him, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged.
As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more
than the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was
not long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion; and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them
out. She certainly did not hate him. No; hatred had vanished long
ago, and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him, that could be so called. The respect created by the
conviction of his valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feeling; and it
was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in his favour, and bringing forward his disposition in
so amiable a light, which yesterday had produced. But above all, above
respect and esteem, there was a motive within her of goodwill which
could not be overlooked. It was gratitude; gratitude, not merely for
having once loved her, but for loving her still well enough to forgive
all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all
the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection. He who, she had
been persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on
this accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance, and
without any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner,
183
where their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good
opinion of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister.
Such a change in a man of so much pride exciting not only astonishment but gratitude—for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and
as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by
no means unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined. She respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest
in his welfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that
welfare to depend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power, which her fancy told
her she still possessed, of bringing on her the renewal of his addresses.
It had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the niece,
that such a striking civility as Miss Darcy's in coming to see them on
the very day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she had reached it only to
a late breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled,
by some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it
would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following
morning. They were, therefore, to go. Elizabeth was pleased; though
when she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.
Mr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. The fishing scheme had
been renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his
meeting some of the gentlemen at Pemberley before noon.
Chapter 45
Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley's dislike of her
had originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how unwelcome
her appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know
with how much civility on that lady's side the acquaintance would
now be renewed.
On reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the
saloon, whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer. Its
windows opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of
the high woody hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and
Spanish chestnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.
In this house they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting
there with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she
lived in London. Georgiana's reception of them was very civil, but
attended with all the embarrassment which, though proceeding from
shyness and the fear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who
184
felt themselves inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved. Mrs.
Gardiner and her niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her.
By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey; and, on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must
always be, succeeded for a few moments. It was first broken by Mrs.
Annesley, a genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to
introduce some kind of discourse proved her to be more truly wellbred than either of the others; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner,
with occasional help from Elizabeth, the conversation was carried on.
Miss Darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it; and
sometimes did venture a short sentence when there was least danger
of its being heard.
Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss
Bingley, and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy,
without calling her attention. This observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated
at an inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much. Her own thoughts were employing her. She
expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the
room. She wished, she feared that the master of the house might be
amongst them; and whether she wished or feared it most, she could
scarcely determine. After sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour
without hearing Miss Bingley's voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold inquiry after the health of her family. She answered
with equal indifference and brevity, and the others said no more.
The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the
entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the finest
fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a significant
look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been given, to
remind her of her post. There was now employment for the whole
party—for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the
beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches soon collected
them round the table.
While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding
whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy,
by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then,
though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to regret that he came.
He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three
other gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had
left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit
185
to Georgiana that morning. No sooner did he appear than Elizabeth
wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed; a resolution
the more necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept,
because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened
against them, and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch
his behaviour when he first came into the room. In no countenance was
attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley's, in spite of
the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its
objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions
to Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her brother's
entrance, exerted herself much more to talk, and Elizabeth saw that he
was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded
as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. Miss
Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the
first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility:
“Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ——shire Militia removed from Meryton? They must be a great loss to your family.”
In Darcy's presence she dared not mention Wickham's name;
but Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her
thoughts; and the various recollections connected with him gave her
a moment's distress; but exerting herself vigorously to repel the illnatured attack, she presently answered the question in a tolerably
detached tone. While she spoke, an involuntary glance showed her
Darcy, with a heightened complexion, earnestly looking at her, and
his sister overcome with confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes.
Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved
friend, she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint; but she
had merely intended to discompose Elizabeth by bringing forward the
idea of a man to whom she believed her partial, to make her betray a
sensibility which might injure her in Darcy's opinion, and, perhaps, to
remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part
of her family were connected with that corps. Not a syllable had ever
reached her of Miss Darcy's meditated elopement. To no creature had
it been revealed, where secrecy was possible, except to Elizabeth; and
from all Bingley's connections her brother was particularly anxious to
conceal it, from the very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed
to him, of their becoming hereafter her own. He had certainly formed
such a plan, and without meaning that it should effect his endeavour to
separate him from Miss Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend.
Elizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emo186
tion; and as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though
not enough to be able to speak any more. Her brother, whose eye she
feared to meet, scarcely recollected her interest in the affair, and the
very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from
Elizabeth seemed to have fixed them on her more and more cheerfully.
Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer
above mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their
carriage Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth's person, behaviour, and dress. But Georgiana would not join her.
Her brother's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour; his
judgement could not err. And he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth
as to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than
lovely and amiable. When Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley
could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying
to his sister.
“How very ill Miss Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,” she
cried; “I never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the
winter. She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing
that we should not have known her again.”
However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned, no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer.
“For my own part,” she rejoined, “I must confess that I never could
see any beauty in her. Her face is too thin; her complexion has no
brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome. Her nose wants
character—there is nothing marked in its lines. Her teeth are tolerable,
but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which have sometimes been called so fine, I could never see anything extraordinary in
them. They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not like at all; and
in her air altogether there is a self-sufficiency without fashion, which is
intolerable.”
Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this
was not the best method of recommending herself; but angry people
are not always wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled,
she had all the success she expected. He was resolutely silent, however,
and, from a determination of making him speak, she continued:
“I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how
amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect your saying one night, after they had been dining at
187
Netherfield, ‘She a beauty!—I should as soon call her mother a wit.' But
afterwards she seemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought
her rather pretty at one time.”
“Yes,” replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, “but
that was only when I first saw her, for it is many months since I have
considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance.”
He then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction
of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.
Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested them both. The look and behaviour of everybody they had seen
were discussed, except of the person who had mostly engaged their
attention. They talked of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit—of
everything but himself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs.
Gardiner thought of him, and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly
gratified by her niece's beginning the subject.
Chapter 46
Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter
from Jane on their first arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment
had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent
there; but on the third her repining was over, and her sister justified, by
the receipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked
that it had been missent elsewhere. Elizabeth was not surprised at it,
as Jane had written the direction remarkably ill.
They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and
her uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by themselves. The one missent must first be attended to; it had been written
five days ago. The beginning contained an account of all their little
parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded; but
the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident agitation, gave more important intelligence. It was to this effect:
“Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred
of a most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming
you—be assured that we are all well. What I have to say relates to
poor Lydia. An express came at twelve last night, just as we were all
gone to bed, from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was gone off
to Scotland with one of his officers; to own the truth, with Wickham!
188
Imagine our surprise. To Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly
unexpected. I am very, very sorry. So imprudent a match on both
sides! But I am willing to hope the best, and that his character has been
misunderstood. Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him,
but this step (and let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart.
His choice is disinterested at least, for he must know my father can
give her nothing. Our poor mother is sadly grieved. My father bears it
better. How thankful am I that we never let them know what has been
said against him; we must forget it ourselves. They were off Saturday
night about twelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday
morning at eight. The express was sent off directly. My dear Lizzy,
they must have passed within ten miles of us. Colonel Forster gives
us reason to expect him here soon. Lydia left a few lines for his wife,
informing her of their intention. I must conclude, for I cannot be long
from my poor mother. I am afraid you will not be able to make it out,
but I hardly know what I have written.”
Without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely
knowing what she felt, Elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly
seized the other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as
follows: it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first.
“By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried letter; I wish this may be more intelligible, but though not confined for
time, my head is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coherent. Dearest Lizzy, I hardly know what I would write, but I have bad
news for you, and it cannot be delayed. Imprudent as the marriage
between Mr. Wickham and our poor Lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place, for there is but too much reason
to fear they are not gone to Scotland. Colonel Forster came yesterday,
having left Brighton the day before, not many hours after the express.
Though Lydia's short letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that
they were going to Gretna Green, something was dropped by Denny
expressing his belief that W. never intended to go there, or to marry
Lydia at all, which was repeated to Colonel F., who, instantly taking
the alarm, set off from B. intending to trace their route. He did trace
them easily to Clapham, but no further; for on entering that place, they
removed into a hackney coach, and dismissed the chaise that brought
them from Epsom. All that is known after this is, that they were seen
to continue the London road. I know not what to think. After making every possible inquiry on that side London, Colonel F. came on
into Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and
189
at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but without any success—no such
people had been seen to pass through. With the kindest concern he
came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart. I am sincerely grieved for him and
Mrs. F., but no one can throw any blame on them. Our distress, my
dear Lizzy, is very great. My father and mother believe the worst, but I
cannot think so ill of him. Many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first
plan; and even if he could form such a design against a young woman
of Lydia's connections, which is not likely, can I suppose her so lost to
everything? Impossible! I grieve to find, however, that Colonel F. is
not disposed to depend upon their marriage; he shook his head when
I expressed my hopes, and said he fear W. was not a man to be trusted.
My poor mother is really ill, and keeps her room. Could she exert herself, it would be better; but this is not to be expected. And as to my
father, I never in my life saw him so affected. Poor Kitty has anger
for having concealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence, one cannot wonder. I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you
have been spared something of these distressing scenes; but now, as
the first shock is over, shall I own that I long for your return? I am not
so selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient. Adieu! I take up
my pen again to do what I have just told you I would not; but circumstances are such that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to come
here as soon as possible. I know my dear uncle and aunt so well, that
I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have still something more to
ask of the former. My father is going to London with Colonel Forster
instantly, to try to discover her. What he means to do I am sure I know
not; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at
Brighton again to-morrow evening. In such an exigence, my uncle's
advice and assistance would be everything in the world; he will immediately comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness.”
“Oh! where, where is my uncle?” cried Elizabeth, darting from
her seat as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without
losing a moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door
it was opened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy appeared. Her pale face
and impetuous manner made him start, and before he could recover
himself to speak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by
Lydia's situation, hastily exclaimed, “I beg your pardon, but I must
leave you. I must find Mr. Gardiner this moment, on business that
190
cannot be delayed; I have not an instant to lose.”
“Good God! what is the matter?” cried he, with more feeling than
politeness; then recollecting himself, “I will not detain you a minute;
but let me, or let the servant go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner. You are
not well enough; you cannot go yourself.”
Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her and she felt
how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them. Calling back the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so
breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and mistress home instantly.
On his quitting the room she sat down, unable to support herself,
and looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave
her, or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration, “Let me call your maid. Is there nothing you could take to give
you present relief? A glass of wine; shall I get you one? You are very
ill.”
“No, I thank you,” she replied, endeavouring to recover herself.
“There is nothing the matter with me. I am quite well; I am only distressed by some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn.”
She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could
not speak another word. Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say
something indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionate silence. At length she spoke again. “I have just had a letter from
Jane, with such dreadful news. It cannot be concealed from anyone.
My younger sister has left all her friends—has eloped; has thrown herself into the power of—of Mr. Wickham. They are gone off together
from Brighton. You know him too well to doubt the rest. She has no
money, no connections, nothing that can tempt him to—she is lost for
ever.”
Darcy was fixed in astonishment. “When I consider,” she added in
a yet more agitated voice, “that I might have prevented it! I, who knew
what he was. Had I but explained some part of it only—some part of
what I learnt, to my own family! Had his character been known, this
could not have happened. But it is all—all too late now.”
“I am grieved indeed,” cried Darcy; “grieved—shocked. But is it
certain—absolutely certain?”
“Oh, yes! They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were
traced almost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone
to Scotland.”
“And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover
191
her?”
“My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle's immediate assistance; and we shall be off, I hope, in half-an-hour.
But nothing can be done—I know very well that nothing can be done.
How is such a man to be worked on? How are they even to be discovered? I have not the smallest hope. It is every way horrible!”
Darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence.
“When my eyes were opened to his real character—Oh! had I
known what I ought, what I dared to do! But I knew not—I was afraid
of doing too much. Wretched, wretched mistake!”
Darcy made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was
walking up and down the room in earnest meditation, his brow contracted, his air gloomy. Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it. Her power was sinking; everything must sink under such a
proof of family weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace.
She could neither wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his selfconquest brought nothing to her consolatory to her bosom, afforded
no palliation of her distress. It was, on the contrary, exactly calculated
to make her understand her own wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him, as now, when all love must be
vain.
But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her. Lydia—the
humiliation, the misery she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed
up every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief,
Elizabeth was soon lost to everything else; and, after a pause of several
minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of
her companion, who, in a manner which, though it spoke compassion,
spoke likewise restraint, said, “I am afraid you have been long desiring
my absence, nor have I anything to plead in excuse of my stay, but real,
though unavailing concern. Would to Heaven that anything could be
either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to such
distress! But I will not torment you with vain wishes, which may seem
purposely to ask for your thanks. This unfortunate affair will, I fear,
prevent my sister's having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley today.”
“Oh, yes. Be so kind as to apologise for us to Miss Darcy. Say that
urgent business calls us home immediately. Conceal the unhappy truth
as long as it is possible, I know it cannot be long.”
He readily assured her of his secrecy; again expressed his sorrow for her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at
present reason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her relations,
192
with only one serious, parting look, went away.
As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that
they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as
had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw
a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of
contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination.
If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth's change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty. But
if otherwise—if regard springing from such sources is unreasonable
or unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising
on a first interview with its object, and even before two words have
been exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she
had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for
Wickham, and that its ill success might, perhaps, authorise her to seek
the other less interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she
saw him go with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia's infamy must produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that
wretched business. Never, since reading Jane's second letter, had she
entertained a hope of Wickham's meaning to marry her. No one but
Jane, she thought, could flatter herself with such an expectation. Surprise was the least of her feelings on this development. While the contents of the first letter remained in her mind, she was all surprise—all
astonishment that Wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for money; and how Lydia could ever have attached
him had appeared incomprehensible. But now it was all too natural.
For such an attachment as this she might have sufficient charms; and
though she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an
elopement without the intention of marriage, she had no difficulty in
believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve
her from falling an easy prey.
She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire,
that Lydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that Lydia
wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody. Sometimes
one officer, sometimes another, had been her favourite, as their attentions raised them in her opinion. Her affections had continually been
fluctuating but never without an object. The mischief of neglect and
mistaken indulgence towards such a girl—oh! how acutely did she
now feel it!
She was wild to be at home—to hear, to see, to be upon the spot
193
to share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her,
in a family so deranged, a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded
that nothing could be done for Lydia, her uncle's interference seemed
of the utmost importance, and till he entered the room her impatience
was severe. Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing by the servant's account that their niece was taken suddenly ill; but
satisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the
cause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling
on the postscript of the last with trembling energy, though Lydia had
never been a favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not
but be deeply afflicted. Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it;
and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner
promised every assistance in his power. Elizabeth, though expecting
no less, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated by one spirit, everything relating to their journey was speedily
settled. They were to be off as soon as possible. “But what is to be done
about Pemberley?” cried Mrs. Gardiner. “John told us Mr. Darcy was
here when you sent for us; was it so?”
“Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.
That is all settled.”
“What is all settled?” repeated the other, as she ran into her room
to prepare. “And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the
real truth? Oh, that I knew how it was!”
But wishes were vain, or at least could only serve to amuse her in
the hurry and confusion of the following hour. Had Elizabeth been at
leisure to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her
share of business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were
notes to be written to all their friends at Lambton, with false excuses
for their sudden departure. An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr. Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the
inn, nothing remained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the
misery of the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than
she could have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to
Longbourn.

Chapter 47
“I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth,” said her uncle, as
they drove from the town; “and really, upon serious consideration, I
am much more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does
on the matter. It appears to me so very unlikely that any young man
should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel's family, that I am strongly inclined to hope the best. Could he expect that
her friends would not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed
again by the regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster? His
temptation is not adequate to the risk!”
“Do you really think so?” cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.
“Upon my word,” said Mrs. Gardiner, “I begin to be of your uncle's
opinion. It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and interest, for him to be guilty of. I cannot think so very ill of Wickham. Can
you yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe him capable
of it?”
“Not, perhaps, of neglecting his own interest; but of every other
neglect I can believe him capable. If, indeed, it should be so! But I dare
not hope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland if that had been the
case?”
“In the first place,” replied Mr. Gardiner, “there is no absolute proof
that they are not gone to Scotland.”
“Oh! but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is
such a presumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be found
on the Barnet road.”
“Well, then—supposing them to be in London. They may be there,
though for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptional purpose. It is not likely that money should be very abundant on either
side; and it might strike them that they could be more economically,
though less expeditiously, married in London than in Scotland.”
“But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must
their marriage be private? Oh, no, no—this is not likely. His most particular friend, you see by Jane's account, was persuaded of his never
intending to marry her. Wickham will never marry a woman without
some money. He cannot afford it. And what claims has Lydia—what
attraction has she beyond youth, health, and good humour that could
make him, for her sake, forego every chance of benefiting himself by
marrying well? As to what restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in
195
the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her, I am not
able to judge; for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might
produce. But as to your other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold
good. Lydia has no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine,
from my father's behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention
he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family,
that he would do as little, and think as little about it, as any father
could do, in such a matter.”
“But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of
him as to consent to live with him on any terms other than marriage?”
“It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed,” replied Elizabeth,
with tears in her eyes, “that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in
such a point should admit of doubt. But, really, I know not what to say.
Perhaps I am not doing her justice. But she is very young; she has never
been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half-year, nay,
for a twelvemonth—she has been given up to nothing but amusement
and vanity. She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most
idle and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her
way. Since the ——shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but
love, flirtation, and officers have been in her head. She has been doing
everything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give
greater—what shall I call it? susceptibility to her feelings; which are
naturally lively enough. And we all know that Wickham has every
charm of person and address that can captivate a woman.”
“But you see that Jane,” said her aunt, “does not think so very ill of
Wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt.”
“Of whom does Jane ever think ill? And who is there, whatever
might be their former conduct, that she would think capable of such an
attempt, till it were proved against them? But Jane knows, as well as I
do, what Wickham really is. We both know that he has been profligate
in every sense of the word; that he has neither integrity nor honour;
that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating.”
“And do you really know all this?” cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose
curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.
“I do indeed,” replied Elizabeth, colouring. “I told you, the other
day, of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you yourself, when
last at Longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man who
had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him. And
there are other circumstances which I am not at liberty—which it is not
worth while to relate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are
endless. From what he said of Miss Darcy I was thoroughly prepared
196
to see a proud, reserved, disagreeable girl. Yet he knew to the contrary
himself. He must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as
we have found her.”
“But does Lydia know nothing of this? can she be ignorant of what
you and Jane seem so well to understand?”
“Oh, yes!—that, that is the worst of all. Till I was in Kent, and saw
so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was
ignorant of the truth myself. And when I returned home, the ——shire
was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight's time. As that was the
case, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it apparently
be to any one, that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had
of him should then be overthrown? And even when it was settled that
Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of opening her eyes
to his character never occurred to me. That she could be in any danger
from the deception never entered my head. That such a consequence
as this could ensue, you may easily believe, was far enough from my
thoughts.”
“When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason,
I suppose, to believe them fond of each other?”
“Not the slightest. I can remember no symptom of affection on either side; and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you must
be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away.
When first he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him;
but so we all were. Every girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses
about him for the first two months; but he never distinguished her by
any particular attention; and, consequently, after a moderate period
of extravagant and wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and
others of the regiment, who treated her with more distinction, again
became her favourites.”
* * * * *
It may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be
added to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject,
by its repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long,
during the whole of the journey. From Elizabeth's thoughts it was
never absent. Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self-reproach,
she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness.
They travelled as expeditiously as possible, and, sleeping one night
on the road, reached Longbourn by dinner time the next day. It was a
197
comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied
by long expectations.
The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock; and, when
the carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up
their faces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of
capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.
Elizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them a hasty kiss,
hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running down from
her mother's apartment, immediately met her.
Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the
eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been
heard of the fugitives.
“Not yet,” replied Jane. “But now that my dear uncle is come, I
hope everything will be well.”
“Is my father in town?”
“Yes, he went on Tuesday, as I wrote you word.”
“And have you heard from him often?”
“We have heard only twice. He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday
to say that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which
I particularly begged him to do. He merely added that he should not
write again till he had something of importance to mention.”
“And my mother—how is she? How are you all?”
“My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatly
shaken. She is upstairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you
all. She does not yet leave her dressing-room. Mary and Kitty, thank
Heaven, are quite well.”
“But you—how are you?” cried Elizabeth. “You look pale. How
much you must have gone through!”
Her sister, however, assured her of her being perfectly well; and
their conversation, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were engaged with their children, was now put an end to by the
approach of the whole party. Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.
When they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which Elizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by the others, and
they soon found that Jane had no intelligence to give. The sanguine
hope of good, however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested
had not yet deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well,
and that every morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or
her father, to explain their proceedings, and, perhaps, announce their
198
marriage.
Mrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few
minutes' conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the
villainous conduct of Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings
and ill-usage; blaming everybody but the person to whose ill-judging
indulgence the errors of her daughter must principally be owing.
“If I had been able,” said she, “to carry my point in going to
Brighton, with all my family, this would not have happened; but poor
dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her. Why did the Forsters ever
let her go out of their sight? I am sure there was some great neglect or
other on their side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if
she had been well looked after. I always thought they were very unfit
to have the charge of her; but I was overruled, as I always am. Poor
dear child! And now here's Mr. Bennet gone away, and I know he will
fight Wickham, wherever he meets him and then he will be killed, and
what is to become of us all? The Collinses will turn us out before he is
cold in his grave, and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know
what we shall do.”
They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner,
after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told
her that he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist
Mr. Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia.
“Do not give way to useless alarm,” added he; “though it is right to
be prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain. It
is not quite a week since they left Brighton. In a few days more we may
gain some news of them; and till we know that they are not married,
and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as
lost. As soon as I get to town I shall go to my brother, and make him
come home with me to Gracechurch Street; and then we may consult
together as to what is to be done.”
“Oh! my dear brother,” replied Mrs. Bennet, “that is exactly what
I could most wish for. And now do, when you get to town, find them
out, wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, make
them marry. And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that,
but tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy
them, after they are married. And, above all, keep Mr. Bennet from
fighting. Tell him what a dreadful state I am in, that I am frighted
out of my wits—and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over
me—such spasms in my side and pains in my head, and such beatings
at heart, that I can get no rest by night nor by day. And tell my dear
199
Lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me,
for she does not know which are the best warehouses. Oh, brother,
how kind you are! I know you will contrive it all.”
But Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to
her, as well in her hopes as her fear; and after talking with her in this
manner till dinner was on the table, they all left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper, who attended in the absence of her daughters.
Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no
real occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt
to oppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold
her tongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged
it better that one only of the household, and the one whom they could
most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject.
In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who
had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their
appearance before. One came from her books, and the other from
her toilette. The faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no
change was visible in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister,
or the anger which she had herself incurred in this business, had given
more of fretfulness than usual to the accents of Kitty. As for Mary, she
was mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth, with a countenance of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table:
“This is a most unfortunate affair, and will probably be much talked
of. But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded
bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation.”
Then, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added,
“Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this
useful lesson: that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable; that one
false step involves her in endless ruin; that her reputation is no less
brittle than it is beautiful; and that she cannot be too much guarded in
her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex.”
Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to make any reply. Mary, however, continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them.
In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for
half-an-hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of
the opportunity of making any inquiries, which Jane was equally eager to satisfy. After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful
sequel of this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and
200
Miss Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible, the former continued the subject, by saying, “But tell me all and everything about it
which I have not already heard. Give me further particulars. What did
Colonel Forster say? Had they no apprehension of anything before the
elopement took place? They must have seen them together for ever.”
“Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality, especially on Lydia's side, but nothing to give him any alarm. I
am so grieved for him! His behaviour was attentive and kind to the
utmost. He was coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had any idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that
apprehension first got abroad, it hastened his journey.”
“And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did
he know of their intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny
himself?”
“Yes; but, when questioned by him, Denny denied knowing anything of their plans, and would not give his real opinion about it. He
did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying—and from that, I
am inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before.”
“And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained
a doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?”
“How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains? I
felt a little uneasy—a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him in
marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite
right. My father and mother knew nothing of that; they only felt how
imprudent a match it must be. Kitty then owned, with a very natural
triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia's last letter
she had prepared her for such a step. She had known, it seems, of their
being in love with each other, many weeks.”
“But not before they went to Brighton?”
“No, I believe not.”
“And did Colonel Forster appear to think well of Wickham himself?
Does he know his real character?”
“I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly did. He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant. And
since this sad affair has taken place, it is said that he left Meryton
greatly in debt; but I hope this may be false.”
“Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of
him, this could not have happened!”
“Perhaps it would have been better,” replied her sister. “But to
expose the former faults of any person without knowing what their
present feelings were, seemed unjustifiable. We acted with the best
201
intentions.”
“Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia's note to his
wife?”
“He brought it with him for us to see.”
Jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth.
These were the contents:
“My dear Harriet,
“You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help
laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I am
missed. I am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess with who,
I shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the world I
love, and he is an angel. I should never be happy without him, so think
it no harm to be off. You need not send them word at Longbourn of
my going, if you do not like it, for it will make the surprise the greater,
when I write to them and sign my name ‘Lydia Wickham.' What a
good joke it will be! I can hardly write for laughing. Pray make my
excuses to Pratt for not keeping my engagement, and dancing with
him to-night. Tell him I hope he will excuse me when he knows all;
and tell him I will dance with him at the next ball we meet, with great
pleasure. I shall send for my clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I
wish you would tell Sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin
gown before they are packed up. Good-bye. Give my love to Colonel
Forster. I hope you will drink to our good journey.
“Your affectionate friend,
“Lydia Bennet.”
“Oh! thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!” cried Elizabeth when she
had finished it. “What a letter is this, to be written at such a moment!
But at least it shows that she was serious on the subject of their journey.
Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her side
a scheme of infamy. My poor father! how he must have felt it!”
“I never saw anyone so shocked. He could not speak a word for
full ten minutes. My mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole
house in such confusion!”
“Oh! Jane,” cried Elizabeth, “was there a servant belonging to it
who did not know the whole story before the end of the day?”
“I do not know. I hope there was. But to be guarded at such a time is
very difficult. My mother was in hysterics, and though I endeavoured
to give her every assistance in my power, I am afraid I did not do so
202
much as I might have done! But the horror of what might possibly
happen almost took from me my faculties.”
“Your attendance upon her has been too much for you. You do not
look well. Oh that I had been with you! you have had every care and
anxiety upon yourself alone.”
“Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in
every fatigue, I am sure; but I did not think it right for either of them.
Kitty is slight and delicate; and Mary studies so much, that her hours
of repose should not be broken in on. My aunt Phillips came to Longbourn on Tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to
stay till Thursday with me. She was of great use and comfort to us all.
And Lady Lucas has been very kind; she walked here on Wednesday
morning to condole with us, and offered her services, or any of her
daughters', if they should be of use to us.”
“She had better have stayed at home,” cried Elizabeth; “perhaps
she meant well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see
too little of one's neighbours. Assistance is impossible; condolence insufferable. Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied.”
She then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father
had intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.
“He meant I believe,” replied Jane, “to go to Epsom, the place
where they last changed horses, see the postilions and try if anything
could be made out from them. His principal object must be to discover
the number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham. It
had come with a fare from London; and as he thought that the circumstance of a gentleman and lady's removing from one carriage into
another might be remarked he meant to make inquiries at Clapham.
If he could anyhow discover at what house the coachman had before
set down his fare, he determined to make inquiries there, and hoped it
might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach.
I do not know of any other designs that he had formed; but he was in
such a hurry to be gone, and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I
had difficulty in finding out even so much as this.”
Chapter 48
The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the next
morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him.
His family knew him to be, on all common occasions, a most negligent
and dilatory correspondent; but at such a time they had hoped for exer203
tion. They were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence
to send; but even of that they would have been glad to be certain. Mr.
Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.
When he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant
information of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at parting, to prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to Longbourn, as soon as he
could, to the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the
only security for her husband's not being killed in a duel.
Mrs. Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a
few days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces. She shared in their attendance on Mrs. Bennet, and
was a great comfort to them in their hours of freedom. Their other aunt
also visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of
cheering and heartening them up—though, as she never came without
reporting some fresh instance of Wickham's extravagance or irregularity, she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than
she found them.
All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who, but three
months before, had been almost an angel of light. He was declared to
be in debt to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman's family. Everybody declared that he was the wickedest young
man in the world; and everybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness. Elizabeth, though she
did not credit above half of what was said, believed enough to make
her former assurance of her sister's ruin more certain; and even Jane,
who believed still less of it, became almost hopeless, more especially
as the time was now come when, if they had gone to Scotland, which
she had never before entirely despaired of, they must in all probability
have gained some news of them.
Mr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday his wife received a letter from him; it told them that, on his arrival, he had
immediately found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to
Gracechurch Street; that Mr. Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham,
before his arrival, but without gaining any satisfactory information;
and that he was now determined to inquire at all the principal hotels in
town, as Mr. Bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of
them, on their first coming to London, before they procured lodgings.
Mr. Gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure,
but as his brother was eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing
it. He added that Mr. Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to
204
leave London and promised to write again very soon. There was also
a postscript to this effect:
“I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if possible, from some of the young man's intimates in the regiment, whether
Wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to
know in what part of town he has now concealed himself. If there
were anyone that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such
a clue as that, it might be of essential consequence. At present we have
nothing to guide us. Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do everything in
his power to satisfy us on this head. But, on second thoughts, perhaps,
Lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living, better than any
other person.”
Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference
to her authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any
information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved.
She had never heard of his having had any relations, except a father
and mother, both of whom had been dead many years. It was possible,
however, that some of his companions in the ——shire might be able
to give more information; and though she was not very sanguine in
expecting it, the application was a something to look forward to.
Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most
anxious part of each was when the post was expected. The arrival of
letters was the grand object of every morning's impatience. Through
letters, whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated, and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of
importance.
But before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived for
their father, from a different quarter, from Mr. Collins; which, as Jane
had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence, she
accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his letters
always were, looked over her, and read it likewise. It was as follows:
“My dear sir,
“I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation in
life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from
Hertfordshire. Be assured, my dear sir, that Mrs. Collins and myself
sincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable family, in your
present distress, which must be of the bitterest kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove. No arguments shall be
wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortune—or that
205
may comfort you, under a circumstance that must be of all others the
most afflicting to a parent's mind. The death of your daughter would
have been a blessing in comparison of this. And it is the more to be
lamented, because there is reason to suppose as my dear Charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has
proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence; though, at the same
time, for the consolation of yourself and Mrs. Bennet, I am inclined
to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad, or she could
not be guilty of such an enormity, at so early an age. Howsoever that
may be, you are grievously to be pitied; in which opinion I am not
only joined by Mrs. Collins, but likewise by Lady Catherine and her
daughter, to whom I have related the affair. They agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the
fortunes of all the others; for who, as Lady Catherine herself condescendingly says, will connect themselves with such a family? And this
consideration leads me moreover to reflect, with augmented satisfaction, on a certain event of last November; for had it been otherwise, I
must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace. Let me then
advise you, dear sir, to console yourself as much as possible, to throw
off your unworthy child from your affection for ever, and leave her to
reap the fruits of her own heinous offense.
“I am, dear sir, etc., etc.”
Mr. Gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer
from Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to
send. It was not known that Wickham had a single relationship with
whom he kept up any connection, and it was certain that he had no
near one living. His former acquaintances had been numerous; but
since he had been in the militia, it did not appear that he was on terms
of particular friendship with any of them. There was no one, therefore, who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him. And
in the wretched state of his own finances, there was a very powerful
motive for secrecy, in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia's relations, for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind
him to a very considerable amount. Colonel Forster believed that more
than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at
Brighton. He owed a good deal in town, but his debts of honour were
still more formidable. Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these
particulars from the Longbourn family. Jane heard them with horror.
“A gamester!” she cried. “This is wholly unexpected. I had not an idea
of it.”
206
Mr. Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their
father at home on the following day, which was Saturday. Rendered
spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he had yielded to his
brother-in-law's entreaty that he would return to his family, and leave
it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for
continuing their pursuit. When Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she did
not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering
what her anxiety for his life had been before.
“What, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?” she cried.
“Sure he will not leave London before he has found them. Who is to
fight Wickham, and make him marry her, if he comes away?”
As Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that
she and the children should go to London, at the same time that Mr.
Bennet came from it. The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of
their journey, and brought its master back to Longbourn.
Mrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and
her Derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the
world. His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them
by her niece; and the kind of half-expectation which Mrs. Gardiner
had formed, of their being followed by a letter from him, had ended in
nothing. Elizabeth had received none since her return that could come
from Pemberley.
The present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse
for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be
fairly conjectured from that, though Elizabeth, who was by this time
tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware
that, had she known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread
of Lydia's infamy somewhat better. It would have spared her, she
thought, one sleepless night out of two.
When Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual
philosophic composure. He said as little as he had ever been in the
habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him
away, and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak
of it.
It was not till the afternoon, when he had joined them at tea, that
Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly
expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, “Say
nothing of that. Who should suffer but myself? It has been my own
doing, and I ought to feel it.”
“You must not be too severe upon yourself,” replied Elizabeth.
“You may well warn me against such an evil. Human nature is so
207
prone to fall into it! No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much
I have been to blame. I am not afraid of being overpowered by the
impression. It will pass away soon enough.”
“Do you suppose them to be in London?”
“Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?”
“And Lydia used to want to go to London,” added Kitty.
“She is happy then,” said her father drily; “and her residence there
will probably be of some duration.”
Then after a short silence he continued:
“Lizzy, I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to
me last May, which, considering the event, shows some greatness of
mind.”
They were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her
mother's tea.
“This is a parade,” he cried, “which does one good; it gives such
an elegance to misfortune! Another day I will do the same; I will sit
in my library, in my nightcap and powdering gown, and give as much
trouble as I can; or, perhaps, I may defer it till Kitty runs away.”
“I am not going to run away, papa,” said Kitty fretfully. “If I should
ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia.”
“You go to Brighton. I would not trust you so near it as Eastbourne
for fifty pounds! No, Kitty, I have at last learnt to be cautious, and
you will feel the effects of it. No officer is ever to enter into my house
again, nor even to pass through the village. Balls will be absolutely
prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters. And you are
never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you have spent ten
minutes of every day in a rational manner.”
Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.
“Well, well,” said he, “do not make yourself unhappy. If you are a
good girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at the end
of them.”
Chapter 49
Two days after Mr. Bennet's return, as Jane and Elizabeth were
walking together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the
housekeeper coming towards them, and, concluding that she came to
call them to their mother, went forward to meet her; but, instead of
the expected summons, when they approached her, she said to Miss
Bennet, “I beg your pardon, madam, for interrupting you, but I was in
208
hopes you might have got some good news from town, so I took the
liberty of coming to ask.”
“What do you mean, Hill? We have heard nothing from town.”
“Dear madam,” cried Mrs. Hill, in great astonishment, “don't you
know there is an express come for master from Mr. Gardiner? He has
been here this half-hour, and master has had a letter.”
Away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech. They
ran through the vestibule into the breakfast-room; from thence to the
library; their father was in neither; and they were on the point of seeking him upstairs with their mother, when they were met by the butler,
who said:
“If you are looking for my master, ma'am, he is walking towards
the little copse.”
Upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once
more, and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately
pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock.
Jane, who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running
as Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath,
came up with him, and eagerly cried out:
“Oh, papa, what news—what news? Have you heard from my uncle?”
“Yes I have had a letter from him by express.”
“Well, and what news does it bring—good or bad?”
“What is there of good to be expected?” said he, taking the letter
from his pocket. “But perhaps you would like to read it.”
Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand. Jane now came up.
“Read it aloud,” said their father, “for I hardly know myself what it
is about.”
“Gracechurch Street, Monday,
August 2.
“My dear brother,
“At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such
as, upon the whole, I hope it will give you satisfaction. Soon after you
left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out in what part of
London they were. The particulars I reserve till we meet; it is enough
to know they are discovered. I have seen them both—”
“Then it is as I always hoped,” cried Jane; “they are married!”
Elizabeth read on:
209
“I have seen them both. They are not married, nor can I find there
was any intention of being so; but if you are willing to perform the
engagements which I have ventured to make on your side, I hope it
will not be long before they are. All that is required of you is, to assure
to your daughter, by settlement, her equal share of the five thousand
pounds secured among your children after the decease of yourself and
my sister; and, moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her,
during your life, one hundred pounds per annum. These are conditions which, considering everything, I had no hesitation in complying
with, as far as I thought myself privileged, for you. I shall send this by
express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer. You
will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that Mr. Wickham's
circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to
be. The world has been deceived in that respect; and I am happy to
say there will be some little money, even when all his debts are discharged, to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune. If, as I
conclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act in your name
throughout the whole of this business, I will immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement. There will not
be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again; therefore stay
quiet at Longbourn, and depend on my diligence and care. Send back
your answer as fast as you can, and be careful to write explicitly. We
have judged it best that my niece should be married from this house,
of which I hope you will approve. She comes to us to-day. I shall write
again as soon as anything more is determined on. Yours, etc.,
“Edw. Gardiner.”
“Is it possible?” cried Elizabeth, when she had finished. “Can it be
possible that he will marry her?”
“Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we thought him,” said
her sister. “My dear father, I congratulate you.”
“And have you answered the letter?” cried Elizabeth.
“No; but it must be done soon.”
Most earnestly did she then entreaty him to lose no more time before he wrote.
“Oh! my dear father,” she cried, “come back and write immediately.
Consider how important every moment is in such a case.”
“Let me write for you,” said Jane, “if you dislike the trouble yourself.”
“I dislike it very much,” he replied; “but it must be done.”
210
And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the
house.
“And may I ask—” said Elizabeth; “but the terms, I suppose, must
be complied with.”
“Complied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so little.”
“And they must marry! Yet he is such a man!”
“Yes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be done. But
there are two things that I want very much to know; one is, how much
money your uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the other, how
am I ever to pay him.”
“Money! My uncle!” cried Jane, “what do you mean, sir?”
“I mean, that no man in his senses would marry Lydia on so slight
a temptation as one hundred a year during my life, and fifty after I am
gone.”
“That is very true,” said Elizabeth; “though it had not occurred to
me before. His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain!
Oh! it must be my uncle's doings! Generous, good man, I am afraid he
has distressed himself. A small sum could not do all this.”
“No,” said her father; “Wickham's a fool if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds. I should be sorry to think so ill
of him, in the very beginning of our relationship.”
“Ten thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a sum to
be repaid?”
Mr. Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought,
continued silent till they reached the house. Their father then went on
to the library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room.
“And they are really to be married!” cried Elizabeth, as soon as they
were by themselves. “How strange this is! And for this we are to be
thankful. That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness,
and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice. Oh, Lydia!”
“I comfort myself with thinking,” replied Jane, “that he certainly
would not marry Lydia if he had not a real regard for her. Though our
kind uncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe
that ten thousand pounds, or anything like it, has been advanced. He
has children of his own, and may have more. How could he spare half
ten thousand pounds?”
“If he were ever able to learn what Wickham's debts have been,”
said Elizabeth, “and how much is settled on his side on our sister,
we shall exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them, because
Wickham has not sixpence of his own. The kindness of my uncle and
aunt can never be requited. Their taking her home, and affording her
211
their personal protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her
advantage as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge. By this
time she is actually with them! If such goodness does not make her
miserable now, she will never deserve to be happy! What a meeting
for her, when she first sees my aunt!”
“We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side,”
said Jane: “I hope and trust they will yet be happy. His consenting to
marry her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of
thinking. Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself
they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in
time make their past imprudence forgotten.”
“Their conduct has been such,” replied Elizabeth, “as neither you,
nor I, nor anybody can ever forget. It is useless to talk of it.”
It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood
perfectly ignorant of what had happened. They went to the library,
therefore, and asked their father whether he would not wish them to
make it known to her. He was writing and, without raising his head,
coolly replied:
“Just as you please.”
“May we take my uncle's letter to read to her?”
“Take whatever you like, and get away.”
Elizabeth took the letter from his writing-table, and they went upstairs together. Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet: one communication would, therefore, do for all. After a slight preparation for
good news, the letter was read aloud. Mrs. Bennet could hardly contain
herself. As soon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner's hope of Lydia's being
soon married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added
to its exuberance. She was now in an irritation as violent from delight,
as she had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation. To know that
her daughter would be married was enough. She was disturbed by no
fear for her felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.
“My dear, dear Lydia!” she cried. “This is delightful indeed! She
will be married! I shall see her again! She will be married at sixteen!
My good, kind brother! I knew how it would be. I knew he would
manage everything! How I long to see her! and to see dear Wickham
too! But the clothes, the wedding clothes! I will write to my sister
Gardiner about them directly. Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father,
and ask him how much he will give her. Stay, stay, I will go myself.
Ring the bell, Kitty, for Hill. I will put on my things in a moment. My
dear, dear Lydia! How merry we shall be together when we meet!”
212
Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence
of these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which
Mr. Gardiner's behaviour laid them all under.
“For we must attribute this happy conclusion,” she added, “in a
great measure to his kindness. We are persuaded that he has pledged
himself to assist Mr. Wickham with money.”
“Well,” cried her mother, “it is all very right; who should do it but
her own uncle? If he had not had a family of his own, I and my children
must have had all his money, you know; and it is the first time we have
ever had anything from him, except a few presents. Well! I am so
happy! In a short time I shall have a daughter married. Mrs. Wickham!
How well it sounds! And she was only sixteen last June. My dear
Jane, I am in such a flutter, that I am sure I can't write; so I will dictate,
and you write for me. We will settle with your father about the money
afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately.”
She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and
cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders,
had not Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait till her
father was at leisure to be consulted. One day's delay, she observed,
would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy to be
quite so obstinate as usual. Other schemes, too, came into her head.
“I will go to Meryton,” said she, “as soon as I am dressed, and tell
the good, good news to my sister Philips. And as I come back, I can call
on Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long. Kitty, run down and order the carriage.
An airing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure. Girls, can I
do anything for you in Meryton? Oh! Here comes Hill! My dear Hill,
have you heard the good news? Miss Lydia is going to be married; and
you shall all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding.”
Mrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy. Elizabeth received
her congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took
refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom.
Poor Lydia's situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was
no worse, she had need to be thankful. She felt it so; and though,
in looking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister, in looking back to what they
had feared, only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they
had gained.
213
Chapter 50
Mr. Bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that,
instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum
for the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived
him. He now wished it more than ever. Had he done his duty in that
respect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever
of honour or credit could now be purchased for her. The satisfaction of
prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to
be her husband might then have rested in its proper place.
He was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to
anyone should be forwarded at the sole expense of his brother-in-law,
and he was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his assistance, and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.
When first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly useless, for, of course, they were to have a son. The son was to
join in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the
widow and younger children would by that means be provided for.
Five daughters successively entered the world, but yet the son was to
come; and Mrs. Bennet, for many years after Lydia's birth, had been
certain that he would. This event had at last been despaired of, but it
was then too late to be saving. Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy,
and her husband's love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income.
Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs. Bennet and the children. But in what proportions it should be divided
amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents. This was one
point, with regard to Lydia, at least, which was now to be settled, and
Mr. Bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him. In terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his
brother, though expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper
his perfect approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him. He had never before
supposed that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the
present arrangement. He would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser
by the hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and
pocket allowance, and the continual presents in money which passed
to her through her mother's hands, Lydia's expenses had been very
little within that sum.
That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too,
214
was another very welcome surprise; for his wish at present was to have
as little trouble in the business as possible. When the first transports
of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he
naturally returned to all his former indolence. His letter was soon dispatched; for, though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quick in
its execution. He begged to know further particulars of what he was
indebted to his brother, but was too angry with Lydia to send any message to her.
The good news spread quickly through the house, and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood. It was borne in the latter with decent philosophy. To be sure, it would have been more for
the advantage of conversation had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the
town; or, as the happiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in
some distant farmhouse. But there was much to be talked of in marrying her; and the good-natured wishes for her well-doing which had
proceeded before from all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton lost but a
little of their spirit in this change of circumstances, because with such
an husband her misery was considered certain.
It was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been downstairs; but on
this happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in
spirits oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her
triumph. The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of
her wishes since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants
of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and servants. She was
busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for
her daughter, and, without knowing or considering what their income
might be, rejected many as deficient in size and importance.
“Haye Park might do,” said she, “if the Gouldings could quit it—or
the great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is too far off! I could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and
as for Pulvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful.”
Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the
servants remained. But when they had withdrawn, he said to her:
“Mrs. Bennet, before you take any or all of these houses for your son
and daughter, let us come to a right understanding. Into one house in
this neighbourhood they shall never have admittance. I will not encourage the impudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn.”
A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was firm.
It soon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with amazement and
horror, that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes
215
for his daughter. He protested that she should receive from him no
mark of affection whatever on the occasion. Mrs. Bennet could hardly
comprehend it. That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without
which her marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all she could
believe possible. She was more alive to the disgrace which her want of
new clothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials, than to any sense
of shame at her eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight before
they took place.
Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of the moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their
fears for her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the
proper termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its
unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on
the spot.
She had no fear of its spreading farther through his means. There
were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently
depended; but, at the same time, there was no one whose knowledge
of a sister's frailty would have mortified her so much—not, however,
from any fear of disadvantage from it individually to herself, for, at
any rate, there seemed a gulf impassable between them. Had Lydia's
marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not
to be supposed that Mr. Darcy would connect himself with a family
where, to every other objection, would now be added an alliance and
relationship of the nearest kind with a man whom he so justly scorned.
From such a connection she could not wonder that he would shrink.
The wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his
feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a
blow as this. She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though
she hardly knew of what. She became jealous of his esteem, when she
could no longer hope to be benefited by it. She wanted to hear of him,
when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence. She was
convinced that she could have been happy with him, when it was no
longer likely they should meet.
What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that
the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago,
would now have been most gladly and gratefully received! He was as
generous, she doubted not, as the most generous of his sex; but while
he was mortal, there must be a triumph.
She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who, in
disposition and talents, would most suit her. His understanding and
216
temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes.
It was an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her
ease and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners
improved; and from his judgement, information, and knowledge of
the world, she must have received benefit of greater importance.
But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was. An union of a different
tendency, and precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be
formed in their family.
How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence, she could not imagine. But how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because
their passions were stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.
* * * * *
Mr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother. To Mr. Bennet's acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurance of his eagerness to
promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with entreaties
that the subject might never be mentioned to him again. The principal purport of his letter was to inform them that Mr. Wickham had
resolved on quitting the militia.
“It was greatly my wish that he should do so,” he added, “as soon
as his marriage was fixed on. And I think you will agree with me, in
considering the removal from that corps as highly advisable, both on
his account and my niece's. It is Mr. Wickham's intention to go into the
regulars; and among his former friends, there are still some who are
able and willing to assist him in the army. He has the promise of an ensigncy in General ——'s regiment, now quartered in the North. It is an
advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom. He promises
fairly; and I hope among different people, where they may each have a
character to preserve, they will both be more prudent. I have written to
Colonel Forster, to inform him of our present arrangements, and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr. Wickham in and
near Brighton, with assurances of speedy payment, for which I have
pledged myself. And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying
similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin
a list according to his information? He has given in all his debts; I hope
at least he has not deceived us. Haggerston has our directions, and all
will be completed in a week. They will then join his regiment, unless
they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from Mrs. Gar217
diner, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she leaves
the South. She is well, and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and
your mother.—Yours, etc.,
“E. Gardiner.”
Mr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham's
removal from the ——shire as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do. But
Mrs. Bennet was not so well pleased with it. Lydia's being settled in
the North, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her
company, for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing
in Hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and, besides, it was
such a pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was
acquainted with everybody, and had so many favourites.
“She is so fond of Mrs. Forster,” said she, “it will be quite shocking
to send her away! And there are several of the young men, too, that she
likes very much. The officers may not be so pleasant in General——'s
regiment.”
His daughter's request, for such it might be considered, of being admitted into her family again before she set off for the North, received
at first an absolute negative. But Jane and Elizabeth, who agreed in
wishing, for the sake of their sister's feelings and consequence, that
she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents, urged him so
earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished. And their
mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she would be able to show
her married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished
to the North. When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he
sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon
as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn. Elizabeth was surprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a
scheme, and had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting
with him would have been the last object of her wishes.
Chapter 51
Their sister's wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for
her probably more than she felt for herself. The carriage was sent to
meet them at ——, and they were to return in it by dinner-time. Their
218
arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets, and Jane more especially, who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself,
had she been the culprit, and was wretched in the thought of what her
sister must endure.
They came. The family were assembled in the breakfast room to
receive them. Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet as the carriage
drove up to the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her
daughters, alarmed, anxious, uneasy.
Lydia's voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open,
and she ran into the room. Her mother stepped forwards, embraced
her, and welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand, with an affectionate smile, to Wickham, who followed his lady; and wished them both
joy with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness.
Their reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was
not quite so cordial. His countenance rather gained in austerity; and
he scarcely opened his lips. The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was enough to provoke him. Elizabeth was disgusted, and even
Miss Bennet was shocked. Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed,
wild, noisy, and fearless. She turned from sister to sister, demanding
their congratulations; and when at length they all sat down, looked
eagerly round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and
observed, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been
there.
Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners were always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage
been exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while
he claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all. Elizabeth
had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat
down, resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man. She blushed, and Jane blushed; but the
cheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of
colour.
There was no want of discourse. The bride and her mother could
neither of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit
near Elizabeth, began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood, with a good humoured ease which she felt very unable to
equal in her replies. They seemed each of them to have the happiest
memories in the world. Nothing of the past was recollected with pain;
and Lydia led voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have
alluded to for the world.
“Only think of its being three months,” she cried, “since I went
219
away; it seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there have been things
enough happened in the time. Good gracious! when I went away, I am
sure I had no more idea of being married till I came back again! though
I thought it would be very good fun if I was.”
Her father lifted up his eyes. Jane was distressed. Elizabeth looked
expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw anything of
which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued, “Oh! mamma, do
the people hereabouts know I am married to-day? I was afraid they
might not; and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle, so I was
determined he should know it, and so I let down the side-glass next to
him, and took off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window
frame, so that he might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like
anything.”
Elizabeth could bear it no longer. She got up, and ran out of the
room; and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the
hall to the dining parlour. She then joined them soon enough to see
Lydia, with anxious parade, walk up to her mother's right hand, and
hear her say to her eldest sister, “Ah! Jane, I take your place now, and
you must go lower, because I am a married woman.”
It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first. Her ease and
good spirits increased. She longed to see Mrs. Phillips, the Lucases,
and all their other neighbours, and to hear herself called “Mrs. Wickham” by each of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to
show her ring, and boast of being married, to Mrs. Hill and the two
housemaids.
“Well, mamma,” said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast room, “and what do you think of my husband? Is not he a charming man? I am sure my sisters must all envy me. I only hope they may
have half my good luck. They must all go to Brighton. That is the place
to get husbands. What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go.”
“Very true; and if I had my will, we should. But my dear Lydia, I
don't at all like your going such a way off. Must it be so?”
“Oh, lord! yes;—there is nothing in that. I shall like it of all things.
You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us. We shall
be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some balls,
and I will take care to get good partners for them all.”
“I should like it beyond anything!” said her mother.
“And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my
sisters behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before
the winter is over.”
220
“I thank you for my share of the favour,” said Elizabeth; “but I do
not particularly like your way of getting husbands.”
Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. Mr.
Wickham had received his commission before he left London, and he
was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight.
No one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so short;
and she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter,
and having very frequent parties at home. These parties were acceptable to all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as
did think, than such as did not.
Wickham's affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had expected to find it; not equal to Lydia's for him. She had scarcely needed
her present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that
their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather
than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain that
his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and if
that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity
of having a companion.
Lydia was exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear Wickham on
every occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him. He did
every thing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more
birds on the first of September, than any body else in the country.
One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her
two elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth:
“Lizzy, I never gave you an account of my wedding, I believe. You
were not by, when I told mamma and the others all about it. Are not
you curious to hear how it was managed?”
“No really,” replied Elizabeth; “I think there cannot be too little said
on the subject.”
“La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We
were married, you know, at St. Clement's, because Wickham's lodgings
were in that parish. And it was settled that we should all be there by
eleven o'clock. My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the
others were to meet us at the church. Well, Monday morning came, and
I was in such a fuss! I was so afraid, you know, that something would
happen to put it off, and then I should have gone quite distracted. And
there was my aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking
away just as if she was reading a sermon. However, I did not hear
above one word in ten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my
dear Wickham. I longed to know whether he would be married in his
221
blue coat.”
“Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would
never be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle
and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them. If you'll
believe me, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there
a fortnight. Not one party, or scheme, or anything. To be sure London
was rather thin, but, however, the Little Theatre was open. Well, and so
just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon
business to that horrid man Mr. Stone. And then, you know, when
once they get together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so frightened
I did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and
if we were beyond the hour, we could not be married all day. But,
luckily, he came back again in ten minutes' time, and then we all set
out. However, I recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented
going, the wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done
as well.”
“Mr. Darcy!” repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.
“Oh, yes!—he was to come there with Wickham, you know. But
gracious me! I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it.
I promised them so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be
such a secret!”
“If it was to be secret,” said Jane, “say not another word on the
subject. You may depend upon my seeking no further.”
“Oh! certainly,” said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; “we
will ask you no questions.”
“Thank you,” said Lydia, “for if you did, I should certainly tell you
all, and then Wickham would be angry.”
On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out
of her power, by running away.
But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least
it was impossible not to try for information. Mr. Darcy had been at her
sister's wedding. It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people,
where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go. Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her brain;
but she was satisfied with none. Those that best pleased her, as placing
his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable. She could
not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper, wrote a
short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what Lydia had
dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended.
“You may readily comprehend,” she added, “what my curiosity
must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us, and
222
(comparatively speaking) a stranger to our family, should have been
amongst you at such a time. Pray write instantly, and let me understand it—unless it is, for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy
which Lydia seems to think necessary; and then I must endeavour to
be satisfied with ignorance.”
“Not that I shall, though,” she added to herself, as she finished the
letter; “and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out.”
Jane's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad of it;—till
it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction, she
had rather be without a confidante.
Chapter 52
Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter
as soon as she possibly could. She was no sooner in possession of it
than, hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to be
interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to be
happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain
a denial.
“Gracechurch street, Sept. 6.
“My dear niece,
“I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole morning to answering it, as I foresee that a little writing will not comprise
what I have to tell you. I must confess myself surprised by your application; I did not expect it from you. Don't think me angry, however,
for I only mean to let you know that I had not imagined such inquiries
to be necessary on your side. If you do not choose to understand me,
forgive my impertinence. Your uncle is as much surprised as I am—
and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned would have
allowed him to act as he has done. But if you are really innocent and
ignorant, I must be more explicit.
“On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected visitor. Mr. Darcy called, and was shut up
with him several hours. It was all over before I arrived; so my curiosity
was not so dreadfully racked as your's seems to have been. He came
to tell Mr. Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr.
223
Wickham were, and that he had seen and talked with them both; Wickham repeatedly, Lydia once. From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire
only one day after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of
hunting for them. The motive professed was his conviction of its being
owing to himself that Wickham's worthlessness had not been so well
known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to
love or confide in him. He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him
to lay his private actions open to the world. His character was to speak
for itself. He called it, therefore, his duty to step forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself. If he had
another motive, I am sure it would never disgrace him. He had been
some days in town, before he was able to discover them; but he had
something to direct his search, which was more than we had; and the
consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us.
“There is a lady, it seems, a Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago
governess to Miss Darcy, and was dismissed from her charge on some
cause of disapprobation, though he did not say what. She then took a
large house in Edward-street, and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings. This Mrs. Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted
with Wickham; and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as
he got to town. But it was two or three days before he could get from
her what he wanted. She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery and corruption, for she really did know where her friend
was to be found. Wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in London, and had she been able to receive them into her house,
they would have taken up their abode with her. At length, however,
our kind friend procured the wished-for direction. They were in ——
street. He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia. His
first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade her to
quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her friends as soon
as they could be prevailed on to receive her, offering his assistance,
as far as it would go. But he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared for none of her friends; she wanted
no help of his; she would not hear of leaving Wickham. She was sure
they should be married some time or other, and it did not much signify when. Since such were her feelings, it only remained, he thought,
to secure and expedite a marriage, which, in his very first conversation
with Wickham, he easily learnt had never been his design. He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment, on account of some debts
of honour, which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the
224
ill-consequences of Lydia's flight on her own folly alone. He meant to
resign his commission immediately; and as to his future situation, he
could conjecture very little about it. He must go somewhere, but he
did not know where, and he knew he should have nothing to live on.
“Mr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once.
Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have
been able to do something for him, and his situation must have been
benefited by marriage. But he found, in reply to this question, that
Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country. Under such circumstances,
however, he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief.
“They met several times, for there was much to be discussed. Wickham of course wanted more than he could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable.
“Every thing being settled between them, Mr. Darcy's next step
was to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in
Gracechurch street the evening before I came home. But Mr. Gardiner
could not be seen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further inquiry, that your
father was still with him, but would quit town the next morning. He
did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly
consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him till
after the departure of the former. He did not leave his name, and till the
next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business.
“On Saturday he came again. Your father was gone, your uncle at
home, and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk together.
“They met again on Sunday, and then I saw him too. It was not
all settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express was sent off
to Longbourn. But our visitor was very obstinate. I fancy, Lizzy, that
obstinacy is the real defect of his character, after all. He has been accused of many faults at different times, but this is the true one. Nothing
was to be done that he did not do himself; though I am sure (and I do
not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it), your uncle
would most readily have settled the whole.
“They battled it together for a long time, which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved. But at last your
uncle was forced to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to
his niece, was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of
it, which went sorely against the grain; and I really believe your letter
this morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise
225
where it was due. But, Lizzy, this must go no farther than yourself, or
Jane at most.
“You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done for the
young people. His debts are to be paid, amounting, I believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds, another thousand in addition
to her own settled upon her, and his commission purchased. The reason why all this was to be done by him alone, was such as I have given
above. It was owing to him, to his reserve and want of proper consideration, that Wickham's character had been so misunderstood, and
consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was. Perhaps there was some truth in this; though I doubt whether his reserve,
or anybody's reserve, can be answerable for the event. But in spite of
all this fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured that
your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit
for another interest in the affair.
“When all this was resolved on, he returned again to his friends,
who were still staying at Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should
be in London once more when the wedding took place, and all money
matters were then to receive the last finish.
“I believe I have now told you every thing. It is a relation which you
tell me is to give you great surprise; I hope at least it will not afford
you any displeasure. Lydia came to us; and Wickham had constant
admission to the house. He was exactly what he had been, when I knew
him in Hertfordshire; but I would not tell you how little I was satisfied
with her behaviour while she staid with us, if I had not perceived, by
Jane's letter last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was
exactly of a piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you can give you
no fresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner,
representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done, and all
the unhappiness she had brought on her family. If she heard me, it was
by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen. I was sometimes quite
provoked, but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane, and for
their sakes had patience with her.
“Mr. Darcy was punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you,
attended the wedding. He dined with us the next day, and was to leave
town again on Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be very angry with
me, my dear Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was
never bold enough to say before) how much I like him. His behaviour
to us has, in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire. His understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness, and that, if he marry prudently, his wife
226
may teach him. I thought him very sly;—he hardly ever mentioned
your name. But slyness seems the fashion.
“Pray forgive me if I have been very presuming, or at least do not
punish me so far as to exclude me from P. I shall never be quite happy
till I have been all round the park. A low phaeton, with a nice little pair
of ponies, would be the very thing.
“But I must write no more. The children have been wanting me this
half hour.
“Yours, very sincerely,
“M. Gardiner.”
The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits, in
which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the
greatest share. The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty
had produced of what Mr. Darcy might have been doing to forward
her sister's match, which she had feared to encourage as an exertion
of goodness too great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to
be just, from the pain of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true! He had followed them purposely to town, he
had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on
such a research; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman
whom he must abominate and despise, and where he was reduced to
meet, frequently meet, reason with, persuade, and finally bribe, the
man whom he always most wished to avoid, and whose very name
it was punishment to him to pronounce. He had done all this for a
girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem. Her heart did whisper
that he had done it for her. But it was a hope shortly checked by other
considerations, and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient,
when required to depend on his affection for her —for a woman who
had already refused him—as able to overcome a sentiment so natural
as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham. Brother-in-law of
Wickham! Every kind of pride must revolt from the connection. He
had, to be sure, done much. She was ashamed to think how much. But
he had given a reason for his interference, which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief. It was reasonable that he should feel he had been
wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising it; and
though she would not place herself as his principal inducement, she
could, perhaps, believe that remaining partiality for her might assist
his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially
concerned. It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that they were
under obligations to a person who could never receive a return. They
227
owed the restoration of Lydia, her character, every thing, to him. Oh!
how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had
ever encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards
him. For herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him. Proud
that in a cause of compassion and honour, he had been able to get the
better of himself. She read over her aunt's commendation of him again
and again. It was hardly enough; but it pleased her. She was even
sensible of some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how
steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection
and confidence subsisted between Mr. Darcy and herself.
She was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some one's
approach; and before she could strike into another path, she was overtaken by Wickham.
“I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?” said
he, as he joined her.
“You certainly do,” she replied with a smile; “but it does not follow
that the interruption must be unwelcome.”
“I should be sorry indeed, if it were. We were always good friends;
and now we are better.”
“True. Are the others coming out?”
“I do not know. Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to
Meryton. And so, my dear sister, I find, from our uncle and aunt, that
you have actually seen Pemberley.”
She replied in the affirmative.
“I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too
much for me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle. And you
saw the old housekeeper, I suppose? Poor Reynolds, she was always
very fond of me. But of course she did not mention my name to you.”
“Yes, she did.”
“And what did she say?”
“That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had —
not turned out well. At such a distance as that, you know, things are
strangely misrepresented.”
“Certainly,” he replied, biting his lips. Elizabeth hoped she had
silenced him; but he soon afterwards said:
“I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month. We passed each
other several times. I wonder what he can be doing there.”
“Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh,” said
Elizabeth. “It must be something particular, to take him there at this
time of year.”
“Undoubtedly. Did you see him while you were at Lambton? I
228
thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had.”
“Yes; he introduced us to his sister.”
“And do you like her?”
“Very much.”
“I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within
this year or two. When I last saw her, she was not very promising. I
am very glad you liked her. I hope she will turn out well.”
“I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age.”
“Did you go by the village of Kympton?”
“I do not recollect that we did.”
“I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have had.
A most delightful place!—Excellent Parsonage House! It would have
suited me in every respect.”
“How should you have liked making sermons?”
“Exceedingly well. I should have considered it as part of my duty,
and the exertion would soon have been nothing. One ought not to
repine;—but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me! The
quiet, the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas
of happiness! But it was not to be. Did you ever hear Darcy mention
the circumstance, when you were in Kent?”
“I have heard from authority, which I thought as good, that it was
left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron.”
“You have. Yes, there was something in that; I told you so from the
first, you may remember.”
“I did hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was
not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually
declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business
had been compromised accordingly.”
“You did! and it was not wholly without foundation. You may
remember what I told you on that point, when first we talked of it.”
They were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked
fast to get rid of him; and unwilling, for her sister's sake, to provoke
him, she only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile:
“Come, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know. Do not
let us quarrel about the past. In future, I hope we shall be always of
one mind.”
She held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry,
though he hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.
229
Chapter 53
Mr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that
he never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth, by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that
she had said enough to keep him quiet.
The day of his and Lydia's departure soon came, and Mrs. Bennet
was forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no
means entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was
likely to continue at least a twelvemonth.
“Oh! my dear Lydia,” she cried, “when shall we meet again?”
“Oh, lord! I don't know. Not these two or three years, perhaps.”
“Write to me very often, my dear.”
“As often as I can. But you know married women have never much
time for writing. My sisters may write to me. They will have nothing
else to do.”
Mr. Wickham's adieus were much more affectionate than his wife's.
He smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.
“He is as fine a fellow,” said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were out of
the house, “as ever I saw. He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to
us all. I am prodigiously proud of him. I defy even Sir William Lucas
himself to produce a more valuable son-in-law.”
The loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for several
days.
“I often think,” said she, “that there is nothing so bad as parting
with one's friends. One seems so forlorn without them.”
“This is the consequence, you see, Madam, of marrying a daughter,” said Elizabeth. “It must make you better satisfied that your other
four are single.”
“It is no such thing. Lydia does not leave me because she is married,
but only because her husband's regiment happens to be so far off. If
that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon.”
But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was
shortly relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope,
by an article of news which then began to be in circulation. The housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of
her master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for
several weeks. Mrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets. She looked at Jane,
and smiled and shook her head by turns.
“Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,” (for Mrs.
Phillips first brought her the news). “Well, so much the better. Not that
230
I care about it, though. He is nothing to us, you know, and I am sure
I never want to see him again. But, however, he is very welcome to
come to Netherfield, if he likes it. And who knows what may happen?
But that is nothing to us. You know, sister, we agreed long ago never
to mention a word about it. And so, is it quite certain he is coming?”
“You may depend on it,” replied the other, “for Mrs. Nicholls was
in Meryton last night; I saw her passing by, and went out myself on
purpose to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certain true.
He comes down on Thursday at the latest, very likely on Wednesday.
She was going to the butcher's, she told me, on purpose to order in
some meat on Wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks just
fit to be killed.”
Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing colour. It was many months since she had mentioned his name to
Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said:
“I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the
present report; and I know I appeared distressed. But don't imagine it
was from any silly cause. I was only confused for the moment, because
I felt that I should be looked at. I do assure you that the news does not
affect me either with pleasure or pain. I am glad of one thing, that he
comes alone; because we shall see the less of him. Not that I am afraid
of myself, but I dread other people's remarks.”
Elizabeth did not know what to make of it. Had she not seen him
in Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there
with no other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought
him partial to Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of
his coming there with his friend's permission, or being bold enough to
come without it.
“Yet it is hard,” she sometimes thought, “that this poor man cannot
come to a house which he has legally hired, without raising all this
speculation! I will leave him to himself.”
In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her
feelings in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily perceive
that her spirits were affected by it. They were more disturbed, more
unequal, than she had often seen them.
The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their
parents, about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.
“As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear,” said Mrs. Bennet,
“you will wait on him of course.”
“No, no. You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised, if
I went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters. But it ended
231
in nothing, and I will not be sent on a fool's errand again.”
His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to Netherfield.
“ 'Tis an etiquette I despise,” said he. “If he wants our society, let
him seek it. He knows where we live. I will not spend my hours in
running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back
again.”
“Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not
wait on him. But, however, that shan't prevent my asking him to dine
here, I am determined. We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings
soon. That will make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room
at table for him.”
Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her husband's incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley, in consequence of it, before they did.
As the day of his arrival drew near:
“I begin to be sorry that he comes at all,” said Jane to her sister. “It
would be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference, but I can
hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of. My mother means
well; but she does not know, no one can know, how much I suffer from
what she says. Happy shall I be, when his stay at Netherfield is over!”
“I wish I could say anything to comfort you,” replied Elizabeth;
“but it is wholly out of my power. You must feel it; and the usual
satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because
you have always so much.”
Mr. Bingley arrived. Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of servants, contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of
anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could. She
counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be
sent; hopeless of seeing him before. But on the third morning after his
arrival in Hertfordshire, she saw him, from her dressing-room window,
enter the paddock and ride towards the house.
Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy. Jane resolutely kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother,
went to the window—she looked,—she saw Mr. Darcy with him, and
sat down again by her sister.
“There is a gentleman with him, mamma,” said Kitty; “who can it
be?”
“Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not
know.”
232
“La!” replied Kitty, “it looks just like that man that used to be with
him before. Mr. what's-his-name. That tall, proud man.”
“Good gracious! Mr. Darcy!—and so it does, I vow. Well, any friend
of Mr. Bingley's will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else I must
say that I hate the very sight of him.”
Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern. She knew but
little of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time
after receiving his explanatory letter. Both sisters were uncomfortable
enough. Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their
mother talked on, of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to
be civil to him only as Mr. Bingley's friend, without being heard by
either of them. But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could
not be suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to
shew Mrs. Gardiner's letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment
towards him. To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had
refused, and whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more
extensive information, he was the person to whom the whole family
were indebted for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and
just as what Jane felt for Bingley. Her astonishment at his coming—at
his coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her
again, was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his
altered behaviour in Derbyshire.
The colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half
a minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre
to her eyes, as she thought for that space of time that his affection and
wishes must still be unshaken. But she would not be secure.
“Let me first see how he behaves,” said she; “it will then be early
enough for expectation.”
She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face
of her sister as the servant was approaching the door. Jane looked a
little paler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected.
On the gentlemen's appearing, her colour increased; yet she received
them with tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally
free from any symptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance.
Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat
down again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command. She had ventured only one glance at Darcy. He looked serious,
233
as usual; and, she thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as she had seen him at Pemberley. But, perhaps he
could not in her mother's presence be what he was before her uncle
and aunt. It was a painful, but not an improbable, conjecture.
Bingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed. He was received
by Mrs. Bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters
ashamed, especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious
politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend.
Elizabeth, particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter
the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy,
was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill
applied.
Darcy, after inquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did, a question which she could not answer without confusion, said scarcely anything. He was not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his
silence; but it had not been so in Derbyshire. There he had talked to
her friends, when he could not to herself. But now several minutes
elapsed without bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist the impulse of curiosity, she raised he eyes to his
face, she as often found him looking at Jane as at herself, and frequently
on no object but the ground. More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to
please, than when they last met, were plainly expressed. She was disappointed, and angry with herself for being so.
“Could I expect it to be otherwise!” said she. “Yet why did he
come?”
She was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself;
and to him she had hardly courage to speak.
She inquired after his sister, but could do no more.
“It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,” said Mrs.
Bennet.
He readily agreed to it.
“I began to be afraid you would never come back again. People
did say you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope it is not true. A great many changes have happened in
the neighbourhood, since you went away. Miss Lucas is married and
settled. And one of my own daughters. I suppose you have heard of
it; indeed, you must have seen it in the papers. It was in The Times
and The Courier, I know; though it was not put in as it ought to be. It
was only said, ‘Lately, George Wickham, Esq. to Miss Lydia Bennet,'
without there being a syllable said of her father, or the place where she
234
lived, or anything. It was my brother Gardiner's drawing up too, and
I wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it. Did
you see it?”
Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations. Elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she
could not tell.
“It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,” continued her mother, “but at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is
very hard to have her taken such a way from me. They are gone down
to Newcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to
stay I do not know how long. His regiment is there; for I suppose you
have heard of his leaving the ——shire, and of his being gone into the
regulars. Thank Heaven! he has some friends, though perhaps not so
many as he deserves.”
Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such
misery of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat. It drew from her,
however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually done before; and she asked Bingley whether he meant to make any
stay in the country at present. A few weeks, he believed.
“When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley,” said her
mother, “I beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you please on
Mr. Bennet's manor. I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you,
and will save all the best of the covies for you.”
Elizabeth's misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious attention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had flattered
them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would be hastening
to the same vexatious conclusion. At that instant, she felt that years of
happiness could not make Jane or herself amends for moments of such
painful confusion.
“The first wish of my heart,” said she to herself, “is never more to
be in company with either of them. Their society can afford no pleasure
that will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me never see either
one or the other again!”
Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing
how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her
former lover. When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little;
but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention.
He found her as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured,
and as unaffected, though not quite so chatty. Jane was anxious that no
difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded
235
that she talked as much as ever. But her mind was so busily engaged,
that she did not always know when she was silent.
When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of
her intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at
Longbourn in a few days time.
“You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley,” she added, “for
when you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family
dinner with us, as soon as you returned. I have not forgot, you see;
and I assure you, I was very much disappointed that you did not come
back and keep your engagement.”
Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something
of his concern at having been prevented by business. They then went
away.
Mrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine
there that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did
not think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a
man on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite
and pride of one who had ten thousand a year.
Chapter 54
As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her
spirits; or in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more. Mr. Darcy's behaviour astonished
and vexed her.
“Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent,” said she,
“did he come at all?”
She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.
“He could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt,
when he was in town; and why not to me? If he fears me, why come
hither? If he no longer cares for me, why silent? Teasing, teasing, man!
I will think no more about him.”
Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look, which showed
her better satisfied with their visitors, than Elizabeth.
“Now,” said she, “that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly easy.
I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by his
coming. I am glad he dines here on Tuesday. It will then be publicly
seen that, on both sides, we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance.”
236
“Yes, very indifferent indeed,” said Elizabeth, laughingly. “Oh,
Jane, take care.”
“My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger
now?”
“I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in
love with you as ever.”
* * * * *
They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs. Bennet,
in the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which
the good humour and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour's
visit, had revived.
On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and
the two who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen, were in very good time. When they repaired
to the dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley
would take the place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged
to him, by her sister. Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas,
forbore to invite him to sit by herself. On entering the room, he seemed
to hesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile:
it was decided. He placed himself by her.
Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend.
He bore it with noble indifference, and she would have imagined that
Bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his
eyes likewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an expression of halflaughing alarm.
His behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as
showed an admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded Elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself, Jane's happiness, and his own, would be speedily secured. Though she dared not
depend upon the consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour. It gave her all the animation that her spirits could
boast; for she was in no cheerful humour. Mr. Darcy was almost as far
from her as the table could divide them. He was on one side of her
mother. She knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to
either, or make either appear to advantage. She was not near enough to
hear any of their discourse, but she could see how seldom they spoke
to each other, and how formal and cold was their manner whenever
they did. Her mother's ungraciousness, made the sense of what they
owed him more painful to Elizabeth's mind; and she would, at times,
237
have given anything to be privileged to tell him that his kindness was
neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family.
She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity
of bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass
away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance.
Anxious and uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room,
before the gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a degree that
almost made her uncivil. She looked forward to their entrance as the
point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.
“If he does not come to me, then,” said she, “I shall give him up for
ever.”
The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would
have answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the
table, where Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out
the coffee, in so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy
near her which would admit of a chair. And on the gentlemen's approaching, one of the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in
a whisper:
“The men shan't come and part us, I am determined. We want none
of them; do we?”
Darcy had walked away to another part of the room. She followed
him with her eyes, envied everyone to whom he spoke, had scarcely
patience enough to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged
against herself for being so silly!
“A man who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish
enough to expect a renewal of his love? Is there one among the sex,
who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to
the same woman? There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!”
She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee
cup himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying:
“Is your sister at Pemberley still?”
“Yes, she will remain there till Christmas.”
“And quite alone? Have all her friends left her?”
“Mrs. Annesley is with her. The others have been gone on to Scarborough, these three weeks.”
She could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse
with her, he might have better success. He stood by her, however, for
some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady's whispering
to Elizabeth again, he walked away.
When the tea-things were removed, and the card-tables placed, the
238
ladies all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him,
when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her
mother's rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated
with the rest of the party. She now lost every expectation of pleasure.
They were confined for the evening at different tables, and she had
nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her
side of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.
Mrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen
to supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the
others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.
“Well girls,” said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, “What
say you to the day? I think every thing has passed off uncommonly
well, I assure you. The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw.
The venison was roasted to a turn—and everybody said they never
saw so fat a haunch. The soup was fifty times better than what we had
at the Lucases' last week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged, that the
partridges were remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or
three French cooks at least. And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in
greater beauty. Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did
not. And what do you think she said besides? ‘Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we
shall have her at Netherfield at last.' She did indeed. I do think Mrs.
Long is as good a creature as ever lived—and her nieces are very pretty
behaved girls, and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously.”
Mrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough
of Bingley's behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she would get him
at last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a
happy humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.
“It has been a very agreeable day,” said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth.
“The party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other. I
hope we may often meet again.”
Elizabeth smiled.
“Lizzy, you must not do so. You must not suspect me. It mortifies
me. I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an
agreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it. I
am perfectly satisfied, from what his manners now are, that he never
had any design of engaging my affection. It is only that he is blessed
with greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally
pleasing, than any other man.”
“You are very cruel,” said her sister, “you will not let me smile, and
239
are provoking me to it every moment.”
“How hard it is in some cases to be believed!”
“And how impossible in others!”
“But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I
acknowledge?”
“That is a question which I hardly know how to answer. We all
love to instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing.
Forgive me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make me your
confidante.”
Chapter 55
A few days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone. His
friend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home in
ten days time. He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably
good spirits. Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with
many expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.
“Next time you call,” said she, “I hope we shall be more lucky.”
He should be particularly happy at any time, etc. etc.; and if she
would give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on
them.
“Can you come to-morrow?”
Yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation
was accepted with alacrity.
He came, and in such very good time that the ladies were none
of them dressed. In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughter's room, in her
dressing gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out:
“My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down. He is come—Mr. Bingley is come. He is, indeed. Make haste, make haste. Here, Sarah, come
to Miss Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown. Never
mind Miss Lizzy's hair.”
“We will be down as soon as we can,” said Jane; “but I dare say
Kitty is forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour
ago.”
“Oh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it? Come be quick, be
quick! Where is your sash, my dear?”
But when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to
go down without one of her sisters.
The same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the
evening. After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was his custom,
240
and Mary went up stairs to her instrument. Two obstacles of the five
being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking and winking at Elizabeth
and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any impression
on them. Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last Kitty did,
she very innocently said, “What is the matter mamma? What do you
keep winking at me for? What am I to do?”
“Nothing child, nothing. I did not wink at you.” She then sat still
five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she
suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty, “Come here, my love, I want to
speak to you,” took her out of the room. Jane instantly gave a look
at Elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation, and her
entreaty that she would not give in to it. In a few minutes, Mrs. Bennet
half-opened the door and called out:
“Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you.”
Elizabeth was forced to go.
“We may as well leave them by themselves you know;” said her
mother, as soon as she was in the hall. “Kitty and I are going upstairs
to sit in my dressing-room.”
Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained
quietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned
into the drawing-room.
Mrs. Bennet's schemes for this day were ineffectual. Bingley was
every thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her
daughter. His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance
and command of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter.
He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went
away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs.
Bennet's means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.
After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference. Not a word
passed between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to
bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless
Mr. Darcy returned within the stated time. Seriously, however, she
felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that
gentleman's concurrence.
Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet
spent the morning together, as had been agreed on. The latter was
much more agreeable than his companion expected. There was nothing of presumption or folly in Bingley that could provoke his ridicule,
241
or disgust him into silence; and he was more communicative, and less
eccentric, than the other had ever seen him. Bingley of course returned
with him to dinner; and in the evening Mrs. Bennet's invention was
again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter.
Elizabeth, who had a letter to write, went into the breakfast room for
that purpose soon after tea; for as the others were all going to sit down
to cards, she could not be wanted to counteract her mother's schemes.
But on returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished, she saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that
her mother had been too ingenious for her. On opening the door, she
perceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as if
engaged in earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the
faces of both, as they hastily turned round and moved away from each
other, would have told it all. Their situation was awkward enough; but
her's she thought was still worse. Not a syllable was uttered by either;
and Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley,
who as well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering
a few words to her sister, ran out of the room.
Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence
would give pleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with
the liveliest emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.
“ 'Tis too much!” she added, “by far too much. I do not deserve it.
Oh! why is not everybody as happy?”
Elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth,
a delight, which words could but poorly express. Every sentence of
kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane. But she would not
allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be said
for the present.
“I must go instantly to my mother;” she cried. “I would not on any
account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it
from anyone but myself. He is gone to my father already. Oh! Lizzy, to
know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear
family! how shall I bear so much happiness!”
She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken
up the card party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty.
Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and
ease with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so
many previous months of suspense and vexation.
“And this,” said she, “is the end of all his friend's anxious circumspection! of all his sister's falsehood and contrivance! the happiest,
wisest, most reasonable end!”
242
In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with
her father had been short and to the purpose.
“Where is your sister?” said he hastily, as he opened the door.
“With my mother up stairs. She will be down in a moment, I dare
say.”
He then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good
wishes and affection of a sister. Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship. They shook
hands with great cordiality; and then, till her sister came down, she
had to listen to all he had to say of his own happiness, and of Jane's
perfections; and in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed
all his expectations of felicity to be rationally founded, because they
had for basis the excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of Jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her
and himself.
It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction
of Miss Bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face,
as made her look handsomer than ever. Kitty simpered and smiled,
and hoped her turn was coming soon. Mrs. Bennet could not give her
consent or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her
feelings, though she talked to Bingley of nothing else for half an hour;
and when Mr. Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner
plainly showed how really happy he was.
Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he turned
to his daughter, and said:
“Jane, I congratulate you. You will be a very happy woman.”
Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his
goodness.
“You are a good girl;” he replied, “and I have great pleasure in
thinking you will be so happily settled. I have not a doubt of your
doing very well together. Your tempers are by no means unlike. You
are each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so
easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will
always exceed your income.”
“I hope not so. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters
would be unpardonable in me.”
“Exceed their income! My dear Mr. Bennet,” cried his wife, “what
are you talking of? Why, he has four or five thousand a year, and very
likely more.” Then addressing her daughter, “Oh! my dear, dear Jane,
I am so happy! I am sure I shan't get a wink of sleep all night. I knew
243
how it would be. I always said it must be so, at last. I was sure you
could not be so beautiful for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I saw
him, when he first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how
likely it was that you should come together. Oh! he is the handsomest
young man that ever was seen!”
Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten. Jane was beyond competition her favourite child. At that moment, she cared for no other. Her
younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense.
Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty
begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.
Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn; coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till
after supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not
be enough detested, had given him an invitation to dinner which he
thought himself obliged to accept.
Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister;
for while he was present, Jane had no attention to bestow on anyone
else; but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those
hours of separation that must sometimes occur. In the absence of Jane,
he always attached himself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking
of her; and when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same
means of relief.
“He has made me so happy,” said she, one evening, “by telling me
that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I had not
believed it possible.”
“I suspected as much,” replied Elizabeth. “But how did he account
for it?”
“It must have been his sister's doing. They were certainly no
friends to his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since
he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects.
But when they see, as I trust they will, that their brother is happy with
me, they will learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms
again; though we can never be what we once were to each other.”
“That is the most unforgiving speech,” said Elizabeth, “that I ever
heard you utter. Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see you again
the dupe of Miss Bingley's pretended regard.”
“Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November, he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of my being
indifferent would have prevented his coming down again!”
“He made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of his
244
modesty.”
This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence,
and the little value he put on his own good qualities. Elizabeth was
pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend;
for, though Jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the
world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her
against him.
“I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!” cried
Jane. “Oh! Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed
above them all! If I could but see you as happy! If there were but such
another man for you!”
“If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy
as you. Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have
your happiness. No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have
very good luck, I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time.”
The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long
a secret. Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs. Phillips,
and she ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her
neighbours in Meryton.
The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in
the world, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run
away, they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.
Chapter 56
One morning, about a week after Bingley's engagement with Jane
had been formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the
window, by the sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and
four driving up the lawn. It was too early in the morning for visitors,
and besides, the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours. The horses were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of
the servant who preceded it, were familiar to them. As it was certain,
however, that somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on
Miss Bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk
away with him into the shrubbery. They both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three continued, though with little satisfaction,
till the door was thrown open and their visitor entered. It was Lady
Catherine de Bourgh.
They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their aston245
ishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs. Bennet
and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even inferior to
what Elizabeth felt.
She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious,
made no other reply to Elizabeth's salutation than a slight inclination
of the head, and sat down without saying a word. Elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her ladyship's entrance, though no
request of introduction had been made.
Mrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of
such high importance, received her with the utmost politeness. After
sitting for a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to Elizabeth,
“I hope you are well, Miss Bennet. That lady, I suppose, is your
mother.”
Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.
“And that I suppose is one of your sisters.”
“Yes, madam,” said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to a Lady
Catherine. “She is my youngest girl but one. My youngest of all is
lately married, and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds, walking with a young man who, I believe, will soon become a part of the
family.”
“You have a very small park here,” returned Lady Catherine after a
short silence.
“It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say; but I
assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas's.”
“This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in
summer; the windows are full west.”
Mrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner, and
then added:
“May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left
Mr. and Mrs. Collins well.”
“Yes, very well. I saw them the night before last.”
Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her
from Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling.
But no letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.
Mrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some
refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely,
declined eating anything; and then, rising up, said to Elizabeth,
“Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn. I should be glad to take a turn in it, if
you will favour me with your company.”
246
“Go, my dear,” cried her mother, “and show her ladyship about the
different walks. I think she will be pleased with the hermitage.”
Elizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol, attended her noble guest downstairs. As they passed through
the hall, Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and
drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decent looking rooms, walked on.
Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her
waiting-woman was in it. They proceeded in silence along the gravel
walk that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman who was now more than usually
insolent and disagreeable.
“How could I ever think her like her nephew?” said she, as she
looked in her face.
As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the
following manner:—
“You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of
my journey hither. Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell
you why I come.”
Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.
“Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam. I have not been at all able to
account for the honour of seeing you here.”
“Miss Bennet,” replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, “you ought
to know, that I am not to be trifled with. But however insincere you
may choose to be, you shall not find me so. My character has ever
been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such
moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it. A report of a most
alarming nature reached me two days ago. I was told that not only
your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married,
but that you, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all likelihood, be
soon afterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, Mr. Darcy.
Though I know it must be a scandalous falsehood, though I would not
injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly
resolved on setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments
known to you.”
“If you believed it impossible to be true,” said Elizabeth, colouring with astonishment and disdain, “I wonder you took the trouble of
coming so far. What could your ladyship propose by it?”
“At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted.”
“Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family,” said Eliza247
beth coolly, “will be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report
is in existence.”
“If! Do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves? Do you not know that such a report
is spread abroad?”
“I never heard that it was.”
“And can you likewise declare, that there is no foundation for it?”
“I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship.
You may ask questions which I shall not choose to answer.”
“This is not to be borne. Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied. Has
he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?”
“Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible.”
“It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his
reason. But your arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation,
have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family.
You may have drawn him in.”
“If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.”
“Miss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been accustomed
to such language as this. I am almost the nearest relation he has in the
world, and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns.”
“But you are not entitled to know mine; nor will such behaviour as
this, ever induce me to be explicit.”
“Let me be rightly understood. This match, to which you have the
presumption to aspire, can never take place. No, never. Mr. Darcy is
engaged to my daughter. Now what have you to say?”
“Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he
will make an offer to me.”
Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied:
“The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From their infancy, they have been intended for each other. It was the favourite wish
of his mother, as well as of her's. While in their cradles, we planned the
union: and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would
be accomplished in their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman
of inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to
the family! Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends? To his
tacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling
of propriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say that from his
earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?”
“Yes, and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If there is
no other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not be
kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry
248
Miss de Bourgh. You both did as much as you could in planning the
marriage. Its completion depended on others. If Mr. Darcy is neither
by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make
another choice? And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?”
“Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it. Yes,
Miss Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family
or friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all. You will
be censured, slighted, and despised, by everyone connected with him.
Your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us.”
“These are heavy misfortunes,” replied Elizabeth. “But the wife of
Mr. Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have
no cause to repine.”
“Obstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring? Is nothing due to me on that
score? Let us sit down. You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came
here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will
I be dissuaded from it. I have not been used to submit to any person's
whims. I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment.”
“That will make your ladyship's situation at present more pitiable;
but it will have no effect on me.”
“I will not be interrupted. Hear me in silence. My daughter and
my nephew are formed for each other. They are descended, on the
maternal side, from the same noble line; and, on the father's, from respectable, honourable, and ancient—though untitled—families. Their
fortune on both sides is splendid. They are destined for each other by
the voice of every member of their respective houses; and what is to
divide them? The upstart pretensions of a young woman without family, connections, or fortune. Is this to be endured! But it must not, shall
not be. If you were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to
quit the sphere in which you have been brought up.”
“In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting
that sphere. He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman's daughter; so far we
are equal.”
“True. You are a gentleman's daughter. But who was your mother?
Who are your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine me ignorant of their
condition.”
“Whatever my connections may be,” said Elizabeth, “if your
nephew does not object to them, they can be nothing to you.”
“Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?”
249
Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady
Catherine, have answered this question, she could not but say, after a
moment's deliberation:
“I am not.”
Lady Catherine seemed pleased.
“And will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?”
“I will make no promise of the kind.”
“Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished. I expected to find a
more reasonable young woman. But do not deceive yourself into a
belief that I will ever recede. I shall not go away till you have given me
the assurance I require.”
“And I certainly never shall give it. I am not to be intimidated
into anything so wholly unreasonable. Your ladyship wants Mr. Darcy
to marry your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for
promise make their marriage at all more probable? Supposing him
to be attached to me, would my refusing to accept his hand make him
wish to bestow it on his cousin? Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that
the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was ill-judged. You
have widely mistaken my character, if you think I can be worked on
by such persuasions as these. How far your nephew might approve of
your interference in his affairs, I cannot tell; but you have certainly no
right to concern yourself in mine. I must beg, therefore, to be importuned no farther on the subject.”
“Not so hasty, if you please. I have by no means done. To all the
objections I have already urged, I have still another to add. I am no
stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's infamous elopement. I know it all; that the young man's marrying her was a patchedup business, at the expence of your father and uncles. And is such a
girl to be my nephew's sister? Is her husband, is the son of his late father's steward, to be his brother? Heaven and earth!—of what are you
thinking? Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?”
“You can now have nothing further to say,” she resentfully answered. “You have insulted me in every possible method. I must beg
to return to the house.”
And she rose as she spoke. Lady Catherine rose also, and they
turned back. Her ladyship was highly incensed.
“You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew!
Unfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a connection with you
must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?”
250
“Lady Catherine, I have nothing further to say. You know my sentiments.”
“You are then resolved to have him?”
“I have said no such thing. I am only resolved to act in that manner, which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without
reference to you, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me.”
“It is well. You refuse, then, to oblige me. You refuse to obey the
claims of duty, honour, and gratitude. You are determined to ruin him
in the opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the
world.”
“Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude,” replied Elizabeth, “have
any possible claim on me, in the present instance. No principle of either
would be violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy. And with regard
to the resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the
former were excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment's concern—and the world in general would have too much sense
to join in the scorn.”
“And this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve! Very well.
I shall now know how to act. Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your
ambition will ever be gratified. I came to try you. I hoped to find you
reasonable; but, depend upon it, I will carry my point.”
In this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the door
of the carriage, when, turning hastily round, she added, “I take no
leave of you, Miss Bennet. I send no compliments to your mother. You
deserve no such attention. I am most seriously displeased.”
Elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her
ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself. She
heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs. Her mother
impatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room, to ask why Lady
Catherine would not come in again and rest herself.
“She did not choose it,” said her daughter, “she would go.”
“She is a very fine-looking woman! and her calling here was prodigiously civil! for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were
well. She is on her road somewhere, I dare say, and so, passing through
Meryton, thought she might as well call on you. I suppose she had
nothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?”
Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.
251
Chapter 57
The discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw
Elizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she, for many
hours, learn to think of it less than incessantly. Lady Catherine, it appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings, for
the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr.
Darcy. It was a rational scheme, to be sure! but from what the report
of their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine; till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of Bingley, and
her being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another, to supply the
idea. She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together. And her neighbours
at Lucas Lodge, therefore (for through their communication with the
Collinses, the report, she concluded, had reached lady Catherine), had
only set that down as almost certain and immediate, which she had
looked forward to as possible at some future time.
In revolving Lady Catherine's expressions, however, she could not
help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference. From what she had said of her resolution
to prevent their marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew; and how he might take a similar
representation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared
not pronounce. She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his
aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose
that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do; and it
was certain that, in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one,
whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt
would address him on his weakest side. With his notions of dignity,
he would probably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had
appeared weak and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid
reasoning.
If he had been wavering before as to what he should do, which
had often seemed likely, the advice and entreaty of so near a relation
might settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy as
dignity unblemished could make him. In that case he would return no
more. Lady Catherine might see him in her way through town; and his
engagement to Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.
“If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise should come
to his friend within a few days,” she added, “I shall know how to un252
derstand it. I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of his
constancy. If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might
have obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him
at all.”
* * * * *
The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor
had been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied it, with the same
kind of supposition which had appeased Mrs. Bennet's curiosity; and
Elizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject.
The next morning, as she was going downstairs, she was met by
her father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.
“Lizzy,” said he, “I was going to look for you; come into my room.”
She followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to
tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner
connected with the letter he held. It suddenly struck her that it might
be from Lady Catherine; and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations.
She followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat down.
He then said,
“I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly. As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its
contents. I did not know before, that I had two daughters on the brink
of matrimony. Let me congratulate you on a very important conquest.”
The colour now rushed into Elizabeth's cheeks in the instantaneous
conviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt; and
she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained
himself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to
herself; when her father continued:
“You look conscious. Young ladies have great penetration in such
matters as these; but I think I may defy even your sagacity, to discover
the name of your admirer. This letter is from Mr. Collins.”
“From Mr. Collins! and what can he have to say?”
“Something very much to the purpose of course. He begins with
congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of
which, it seems, he has been told by some of the good-natured, gossiping Lucases. I shall not sport with your impatience, by reading what
he says on that point. What relates to yourself, is as follows: ‘Having
thus offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject
of another; of which we have been advertised by the same authority.
253
Your daughter Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of
Bennet, after her elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of
her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious
personages in this land.'
“Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this?” ‘This young
gentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart of
mortal can most desire,—splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive patronage. Yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my
cousin Elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this gentleman's proposals, which, of course, you
will be inclined to take immediate advantage of.'
“Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is? But now it
comes out:
“ ‘My motive for cautioning you is as follows. We have reason to
imagine that his aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the
match with a friendly eye.'
“Mr. Darcy, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I have surprised
you. Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man within the
circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more
effectually to what they related? Mr. Darcy, who never looks at any
woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at you in
his life! It is admirable!”
Elizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry, but could only
force one most reluctant smile. Never had his wit been directed in a
manner so little agreeable to her.
“Are you not diverted?”
“Oh! yes. Pray read on.”
“ ‘After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship
last night, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed
what she felt on the occasion; when it become apparent, that on the
score of some family objections on the part of my cousin, she would
never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match.
I thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my
cousin, that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are
about, and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.' Mr. Collins moreover adds, ‘I am truly rejoiced that
my cousin Lydia's sad business has been so well hushed up, and am
only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place
should be so generally known. I must not, however, neglect the duties
of my station, or refrain from declaring my amazement at hearing that
you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were
254
married. It was an encouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of
Longbourn, I should very strenuously have opposed it. You ought certainly to forgive them, as a Christian, but never to admit them in your
sight, or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing.' That is his
notion of Christian forgiveness! The rest of his letter is only about his
dear Charlotte's situation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch.
But, Lizzy, you look as if you did not enjoy it. You are not going to be
missish, I hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report. For what
do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in
our turn?”
“Oh!” cried Elizabeth, “I am excessively diverted. But it is so
strange!”
“Yes—that is what makes it amusing. Had they fixed on any other
man it would have been nothing; but his perfect indifference, and your
pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd! Much as I abominate
writing, I would not give up Mr. Collins's correspondence for any consideration. Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving him
the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and
hypocrisy of my son-in-law. And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine about this report? Did she call to refuse her consent?”
To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it
had been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by
his repeating it. Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her
feelings appear what they were not. It was necessary to laugh, when
she would rather have cried. Her father had most cruelly mortified her,
by what he said of Mr. Darcy's indifference, and she could do nothing
but wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead
of his seeing too little, she might have fancied too much.
Chapter 58
Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as
Elizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy
with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady
Catherine's visit. The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs. Bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her
daughter sat in momentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone
with Jane, proposed their all walking out. It was agreed to. Mrs. Bennet was not in the habit of walking; Mary could never spare time; but
the remaining five set off together. Bingley and Jane, however, soon
255
allowed the others to outstrip them. They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy were to entertain each other. Very little was said
by either; Kitty was too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing
the same.
They walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to call
upon Maria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern, when Kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone.
Now was the moment for her resolution to be executed, and, while her
courage was high, she immediately said:
“Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be wounding
your's. I can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister. Ever since I have known it, I have been most
anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it. Were it known
to the rest of my family, I should not have merely my own gratitude to
express.”
“I am sorry, exceedingly sorry,” replied Darcy, in a tone of surprise
and emotion, “that you have ever been informed of what may, in a mistaken light, have given you uneasiness. I did not think Mrs. Gardiner
was so little to be trusted.”
“You must not blame my aunt. Lydia's thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course,
I could not rest till I knew the particulars. Let me thank you again
and again, in the name of all my family, for that generous compassion
which induced you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the sake of discovering them.”
“If you will thank me,” he replied, “let it be for yourself alone. That
the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny. But your family owe me nothing. Much as I respect them, I believe I thought only of
you.”
Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word. After a short
pause, her companion added, “You are too generous to trifle with me.
If your feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once.
My affections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will
silence me on this subject for ever.”
Elizabeth, feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately,
though not very fluently, gave him to understand that her sentiments
had undergone so material a change, since the period to which he al256
luded, as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present
assurances. The happiness which this reply produced, was such as he
had probably never felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do. Had Elizabeth been able to encounter his eye, she might
have seen how well the expression of heartfelt delight, diffused over
his face, became him; but, though she could not look, she could listen,
and he told her of feelings, which, in proving of what importance she
was to him, made his affection every moment more valuable.
They walked on, without knowing in what direction. There was
too much to be thought, and felt, and said, for attention to any other
objects. She soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good
understanding to the efforts of his aunt, who did call on him in her
return through London, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its
motive, and the substance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling
emphatically on every expression of the latter which, in her ladyship's
apprehension, peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance; in
the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that
promise from her nephew which she had refused to give. But, unluckily for her ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.
“It taught me to hope,” said he, “as I had scarcely ever allowed
myself to hope before. I knew enough of your disposition to be certain that, had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you
would have acknowledged it to Lady Catherine, frankly and openly.”
Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, “Yes, you know
enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that. After abusing
you so abominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you
to all your relations.”
“What did you say of me, that I did not deserve? For, though your
accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof. It was
unpardonable. I cannot think of it without abhorrence.”
“We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that
evening,” said Elizabeth. “The conduct of neither, if strictly examined,
will be irreproachable; but since then, we have both, I hope, improved
in civility.”
“I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself. The recollection of what
I then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the
whole of it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful
to me. Your reproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: ‘had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner.' Those were your words. You
257
know not, you can scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me;—
though it was some time, I confess, before I was reasonable enough to
allow their justice.”
“I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an
impression. I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such
a way.”
“I can easily believe it. You thought me then devoid of every proper
feeling, I am sure you did. The turn of your countenance I shall never
forget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible
way that would induce you to accept me.”
“Oh! do not repeat what I then said. These recollections will not do
at all. I assure you that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it.”
Darcy mentioned his letter. “Did it,” said he, “did it soon make
you think better of me? Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its
contents?”
She explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually
all her former prejudices had been removed.
“I knew,” said he, “that what I wrote must give you pain, but it
was necessary. I hope you have destroyed the letter. There was one
part especially, the opening of it, which I should dread your having
the power of reading again. I can remember some expressions which
might justly make you hate me.”
“The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the
preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think
my opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily changed as that implies.”
“When I wrote that letter,” replied Darcy, “I believed myself perfectly calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was written in a
dreadful bitterness of spirit.”
“The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so. The
adieu is charity itself. But think no more of the letter. The feelings
of the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now so
widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten. You must learn some of
my philosophy. Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you
pleasure.”
“I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. Your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment
arising from them is not of philosophy, but, what is much better, of innocence. But with me, it is not so. Painful recollections will intrude
which cannot, which ought not, to be repelled. I have been a selfish
258
being all my life, in practice, though not in principle. As a child I was
taught what was right, but I was not taught to correct my temper. I was
given good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit. Unfortunately an only son (for many years an only child), I was spoilt by
my parents, who, though good themselves (my father, particularly, all
that was benevolent and amiable), allowed, encouraged, almost taught
me to be selfish and overbearing; to care for none beyond my own family circle; to think meanly of all the rest of the world; to wish at least to
think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own. Such
I was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might still have been
but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not owe you! You
taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous. By
you, I was properly humbled. I came to you without a doubt of my
reception. You showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to
please a woman worthy of being pleased.”
“Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?”
“Indeed I had. What will you think of my vanity? I believed you to
be wishing, expecting my addresses.”
“My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally, I assure
you. I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me
wrong. How you must have hated me after that evening?”
“Hate you! I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began
to take a proper direction.”
“I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me, when we
met at Pemberley. You blamed me for coming?”
“No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise.”
“Your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by
you. My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I confess that I did not expect to receive more than my due.”
“My object then,” replied Darcy, “was to show you, by every civility
in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped
to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you see
that your reproofs had been attended to. How soon any other wishes
introduced themselves I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half an
hour after I had seen you.”
He then told her of Georgiana's delight in her acquaintance, and of
her disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading
to the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of
following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed
before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there
had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must
259
comprehend.
She expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject
to each, to be dwelt on farther.
After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to
know anything about it, they found at last, on examining their watches,
that it was time to be at home.
“What could become of Mr. Bingley and Jane!” was a wonder
which introduced the discussion of their affairs. Darcy was delighted
with their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of it.
“I must ask whether you were surprised?” said Elizabeth.
“Not at all. When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen.”
“That is to say, you had given your permission. I guessed as much.”
And though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty
much the case.
“On the evening before my going to London,” said he, “I made a
confession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago. I
told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his
affairs absurd and impertinent. His surprise was great. He had never
had the slightest suspicion. I told him, moreover, that I believed myself
mistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent
to him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was
unabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together.”
Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his
friend.
“Did you speak from your own observation,” said she, “when you
told him that my sister loved him, or merely from my information last
spring?”
“From the former. I had narrowly observed her during the two visits which I had lately made here; and I was convinced of her affection.”
“And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction
to him.”
“It did. Bingley is most unaffectedly modest. His diffidence had
prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but
his reliance on mine made every thing easy. I was obliged to confess
one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him. I could not
allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months
last winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him. He
was angry. But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he
remained in any doubt of your sister's sentiments. He has heartily
forgiven me now.”
260
Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most delightful friend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she
checked herself. She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed
at, and it was rather too early to begin. In anticipating the happiness
of Bingley, which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the conversation till they reached the house. In the hall they
parted.
Chapter 59
“My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?” was a question which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered their
room, and from all the others when they sat down to table. She had
only to say in reply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond
her own knowledge. She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor
anything else, awakened a suspicion of the truth.
The evening passed quietly, unmarked by anything extraordinary.
The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged
were silent. Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth; and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather knew that
she was happy than felt herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment, there were other evils before her. She anticipated what
would be felt in the family when her situation became known; she was
aware that no one liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the
others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might
do away.
At night she opened her heart to Jane. Though suspicion was very
far from Miss Bennet's general habits, she was absolutely incredulous
here.
“You are joking, Lizzy. This cannot be!—engaged to Mr. Darcy! No,
no, you shall not deceive me. I know it to be impossible.”
“This is a wretched beginning indeed! My sole dependence was on
you; and I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not. Yet,
indeed, I am in earnest. I speak nothing but the truth. He still loves
me, and we are engaged.”
Jane looked at her doubtingly. “Oh, Lizzy! it cannot be. I know
how much you dislike him.”
“You know nothing of the matter. That is all to be forgot. Perhaps
I did not always love him so well as I do now. But in such cases as
these, a good memory is unpardonable. This is the last time I shall
261
ever remember it myself.”
Miss Bennet still looked all amazement. Elizabeth again, and more
seriously assured her of its truth.
“Good Heaven! can it be really so! Yet now I must believe you,”
cried Jane. “My dear, dear Lizzy, I would—I do congratulate you—but
are you certain? forgive the question —are you quite certain that you
can be happy with him?”
“There can be no doubt of that. It is settled between us already, that
we are to be the happiest couple in the world. But are you pleased,
Jane? Shall you like to have such a brother?”
“Very, very much. Nothing could give either Bingley or myself
more delight. But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible. And
do you really love him quite well enough? Oh, Lizzy! do anything
rather than marry without affection. Are you quite sure that you feel
what you ought to do?”
“Oh, yes! You will only think I feel more than I ought to do, when I
tell you all.”
“What do you mean?”
“Why, I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley. I am
afraid you will be angry.”
“My dearest sister, now be serious. I want to talk very seriously. Let
me know every thing that I am to know, without delay. Will you tell
me how long you have loved him?”
“It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it
began. But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful
grounds at Pemberley.”
Another entreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the
desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of
attachment. When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing
further to wish.
“Now I am quite happy,” said she, “for you will be as happy as
myself. I always had a value for him. Were it for nothing but his love
of you, I must always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley's friend
and your husband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear
to me. But Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me. How
little did you tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I owe
all that I know of it to another, not to you.”
Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy. She had been unwilling to mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had
made her equally avoid the name of his friend. But now she would
no longer conceal from her his share in Lydia's marriage. All was ac262
knowledged, and half the night spent in conversation.
* * * * *
“Good gracious!” cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a window the
next morning, “if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again
with our dear Bingley! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be
always coming here? I had no notion but he would go a-shooting, or
something or other, and not disturb us with his company. What shall
we do with him? Lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he
may not be in Bingley's way.”
Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal;
yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such
an epithet.
As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and
shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information; and he soon afterwards said aloud, “Mrs. Bennet, have you no
more lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?”
“I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,” said Mrs. Bennet, “to
walk to Oakham Mount this morning. It is a nice long walk, and Mr.
Darcy has never seen the view.”
“It may do very well for the others,” replied Mr. Bingley; “but I am
sure it will be too much for Kitty. Won't it, Kitty?” Kitty owned that she
had rather stay at home. Darcy professed a great curiosity to see the
view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently consented. As she went
up stairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet followed her, saying:
“I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself. But I hope you will not mind it: it is all
for Jane's sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to him,
except just now and then. So, do not put yourself to inconvenience.”
During their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet's consent should
be asked in the course of the evening. Elizabeth reserved to herself
the application for her mother's. She could not determine how her
mother would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and
grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man.
But whether she were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it was certain that her manner would be equally ill
adapted to do credit to her sense; and she could no more bear that Mr.
Darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence
of her disapprobation.
* * * * *
263
In the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library, she
saw Mr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing
it was extreme. She did not fear her father's opposition, but he was
going to be made unhappy; and that it should be through her means—
that she, his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice,
should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her—was
a wretched reflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared
again, when, looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile. In a
few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty;
and, while pretending to admire her work said in a whisper, “Go to
your father, he wants you in the library.” She was gone directly.
Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.
“Lizzy,” said he, “what are you doing? Are you out of your senses, to
be accepting this man? Have not you always hated him?”
How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had
been more reasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have
spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give; but they were now necessary, and she assured
him, with some confusion, of her attachment to Mr. Darcy.
“Or, in other words, you are determined to have him. He is rich,
to be sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than
Jane. But will they make you happy?”
“Have you any other objection,” said Elizabeth, “than your belief
of my indifference?”
“None at all. We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of
man; but this would be nothing if you really liked him.”
“I do, I do like him,” she replied, with tears in her eyes, “I love him.
Indeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly amiable. You do not
know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him
in such terms.”
“Lizzy,” said her father, “I have given him my consent. He is the
kind of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse anything,
which he condescended to ask. I now give it to you, if you are resolved on having him. But let me advise you to think better of it. I
know your disposition, Lizzy. I know that you could be neither happy
nor respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband; unless you
looked up to him as a superior. Your lively talents would place you
in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage. You could scarcely escape discredit and misery. My child, let me not have the grief of seeing
you unable to respect your partner in life. You know not what you are
about.”
264
Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply;
and at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really the
object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that his
affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many
months' suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she did conquer her father's incredulity, and reconcile him to the
match.
“Well, my dear,” said he, when she ceased speaking, “I have no
more to say. If this be the case, he deserves you. I could not have
parted with you, my Lizzy, to anyone less worthy.”
To complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr.
Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia. He heard her with astonishment.
“This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did every
thing; made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow's debts, and
got him his commission! So much the better. It will save me a world
of trouble and economy. Had it been your uncle's doing, I must and
would have paid him; but these violent young lovers carry every thing
their own way. I shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant and
storm about his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter.”
He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his
reading Mr. Collins's letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her at last to go—saying, as she quitted the room, “If any young
men come for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure.”
Elizabeth's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and,
after half an hour's quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to
join the others with tolerable composure. Every thing was too recent
for gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer
anything material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time.
When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her, and made the important communication. Its effect was most
extraordinary; for on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet sat quite still, and unable to utter a syllable. Nor was it under many, many minutes that she
could comprehend what she heard; though not in general backward
to credit what was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the
shape of a lover to any of them. She began at length to recover, to fidget
about in her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.
“Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr. Darcy!
Who would have thought it! And is it really true? Oh! my sweetest
265
Lizzy! how rich and how great you will be! What pin-money, what
jewels, what carriages you will have! Jane's is nothing to it—nothing at
all. I am so pleased—so happy. Such a charming man!—so handsome!
so tall!—Oh, my dear Lizzy! pray apologise for my having disliked
him so much before. I hope he will overlook it. Dear, dear Lizzy. A
house in town! Every thing that is charming! Three daughters married!
Ten thousand a year! Oh, Lord! What will become of me. I shall go
distracted.”
This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be
doubted: and Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only
by herself, soon went away. But before she had been three minutes in
her own room, her mother followed her.
“My dearest child,” she cried, “I can think of nothing else! Ten
thousand a year, and very likely more! 'Tis as good as a Lord! And a
special licence. You must and shall be married by a special licence. But
my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond of,
that I may have it to-morrow.”
This was a sad omen of what her mother's behaviour to the gentleman himself might be; and Elizabeth found that, though in the certain possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations'
consent, there was still something to be wished for. But the morrow
passed off much better than she expected; for Mrs. Bennet luckily stood
in such awe of her intended son-in-law that she ventured not to speak
to him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark
her deference for his opinion.
Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to
get acquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that he was
rising every hour in his esteem.
“I admire all my three sons-in-law highly,” said he. “Wickham, perhaps, is my favourite; but I think I shall like your husband quite as well
as Jane's.”
Chapter 60
Elizabeth's spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr.
Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her. “How
could you begin?” said she. “I can comprehend your going on charmingly, when you had once made a beginning; but what could set you
off in the first place?”
“I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words,
266
which laid the foundation. It is too long ago. I was in the middle
before I knew that I had begun.”
“My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners—my
behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and I
never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not.
Now be sincere; did you admire me for my impertinence?”
“For the liveliness of your mind, I did.”
“You may as well call it impertinence at once. It was very little less.
The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious attention. You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking,
and looking, and thinking for your approbation alone. I roused, and
interested you, because I was so unlike them. Had you not been really
amiable, you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you
took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just;
and in your heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you. There—I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it; and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly
reasonable. To be sure, you knew no actual good of me—but nobody
thinks of that when they fall in love.”
“Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane while
she was ill at Netherfield?”
“Dearest Jane! who could have done less for her? But make a virtue
of it by all means. My good qualities are under your protection, and
you are to exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as
often as may be; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made
you so unwilling to come to the point at last. What made you so shy of
me, when you first called, and afterwards dined here? Why, especially,
when you called, did you look as if you did not care about me?”
“Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement.”
“But I was embarrassed.”
“And so was I.”
“You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner.”
“A man who had felt less, might.”
“How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give,
and that I should be so reasonable as to admit it! But I wonder how
long you would have gone on, if you had been left to yourself. I wonder
when you would have spoken, if I had not asked you! My resolution
of thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect.
Too much, I am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort
267
springs from a breach of promise? for I ought not to have mentioned
the subject. This will never do.”
“You need not distress yourself. The moral will be perfectly fair.
Lady Catherine's unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the
means of removing all my doubts. I am not indebted for my present
happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude. I was
not in a humour to wait for any opening of your's. My aunt's intelligence had given me hope, and I was determined at once to know every
thing.”
“Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her
happy, for she loves to be of use. But tell me, what did you come down
to Netherfield for? Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed? or had you intended any more serious consequence?”
“My real purpose was to see you, and to judge, if I could, whether
I might ever hope to make you love me. My avowed one, or what I
avowed to myself, was to see whether your sister were still partial to
Bingley, and if she were, to make the confession to him which I have
since made.”
“Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine what
is to befall her?”
“I am more likely to want more time than courage, Elizabeth. But it
ought to done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it shall be done
directly.”
“And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you and
admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did.
But I have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected.”
From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr.
Darcy had been over-rated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs.
Gardiner's long letter; but now, having that to communicate which she
knew would be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find that
her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as follows:
“I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to
have done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but to
say the truth, I was too cross to write. You supposed more than really
existed. But now suppose as much as you choose; give a loose rein
to your fancy, indulge your imagination in every possible flight which
the subject will afford, and unless you believe me actually married, you
cannot greatly err. You must write again very soon, and praise him a
great deal more than you did in your last. I thank you, again and again,
268
for not going to the Lakes. How could I be so silly as to wish it! Your
idea of the ponies is delightful. We will go round the Park every day.
I am the happiest creature in the world. Perhaps other people have
said so before, but not one with such justice. I am happier even than
Jane; she only smiles, I laugh. Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the
world that he can spare from me. You are all to come to Pemberley at
Christmas. Yours, etc.”
Mr. Darcy's letter to Lady Catherine was in a different style; and
still different from either was what Mr. Bennet sent to Mr. Collins, in
reply to his last.
“Dear Sir,
“I must trouble you once more for congratulations. Elizabeth will
soon be the wife of Mr. Darcy. Console Lady Catherine as well as you
can. But, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew. He has more to
give.
“Yours sincerely, etc.”
Miss Bingley's congratulations to her brother, on his approaching
marriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere. She wrote even
to Jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her former
professions of regard. Jane was not deceived, but she was affected; and
though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing her a much
kinder answer than she knew was deserved.
The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information, was as sincere as her brother's in sending it. Four sides of paper
were insufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of
being loved by her sister.
Before any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any congratulations to Elizabeth from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that
the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas Lodge. The reason of
this sudden removal was soon evident. Lady Catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew's letter, that
Charlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till
the storm was blown over. At such a moment, the arrival of her friend
was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she
saw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of
her husband. He bore it, however, with admirable calmness. He could
269
even listen to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes
of their all meeting frequently at St. James's, with very decent composure. If he did shrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out
of sight.
Mrs. Phillips's vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater, tax on
his forbearance; and though Mrs. Phillips, as well as her sister, stood
in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley's
good humour encouraged, yet, whenever she did speak, she must be
vulgar. Nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet,
at all likely to make her more elegant. Elizabeth did all she could to
shield him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious
to keep him to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might
converse without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings
arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with
delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little
pleasing to either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party
at Pemberley.
Chapter 61
Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs. Bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters. With what delighted
pride she afterwards visited Mrs. Bingley, and talked of Mrs. Darcy,
may be guessed. I wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that the
accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many
of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible,
amiable, well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps
it was lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic
felicity in so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous
and invariably silly.
Mr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection
for her drew him oftener from home than anything else could do.
He delighted in going to Pemberley, especially when he was least expected.
Mr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth.
So near a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to his easy temper, or her affectionate heart. The darling wish
of his sisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbour270
ing county to Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every
other source of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.
Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time
with her two elder sisters. In society so superior to what she had generally known, her improvement was great. She was not of so ungovernable a temper as Lydia; and, removed from the influence of Lydia's
example, she became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less ignorant, and less insipid. From the further disadvantage
of Lydia's society she was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs.
Wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the
promise of balls and young men, her father would never consent to
her going.
Mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was
necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs. Bennet's being quite unable to sit alone. Mary was obliged to mix more
with the world, but she could still moralize over every morning visit;
and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters' beauty and her own, it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance.
As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution
from the marriage of her sisters. He bore with philosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of
his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in
spite of every thing, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet
be prevailed on to make his fortune. The congratulatory letter which
Elizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage, explained to her that,
by his wife at least, if not by himself, such a hope was cherished. The
letter was to this effect:
“My dear Lizzy,
“I wish you joy. If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as I do my dear
Wickham, you must be very happy. It is a great comfort to have you
so rich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will think
of us. I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much, and
I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without
some help. Any place would do, of about three or four hundred a year;
but however, do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it, if you had rather not.
“Yours, etc.”
As it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not, she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of
271
the kind. Such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the
practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences,
she frequently sent them. It had always been evident to her that such
an income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant
in their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to
their support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane
or herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards discharging their bills. Their manner of living, even when the
restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the
extreme. They were always moving from place to place in quest of a
cheap situation, and always spending more than they ought. His affection for her soon sunk into indifference; her's lasted a little longer;
and in spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims
to reputation which her marriage had given her.
Though Darcy could never receive him at Pemberley, yet, for Elizabeth's sake, he assisted him further in his profession. Lydia was occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone to enjoy himself
in London or Bath; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently
staid so long, that even Bingley's good humour was overcome, and he
proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone.
Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy's marriage; but as
she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, she
dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost as
attentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility to
Elizabeth.
Pemberley was now Georgiana's home; and the attachment of the
sisters was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see. They were able to
love each other even as well as they intended. Georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened
with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively, sportive, manner of talking to her brother. He, who had always inspired in herself
a respect which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object
of open pleasantry. Her mind received knowledge which had never
before fallen in her way. By Elizabeth's instructions, she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband which a
brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger
than himself.
Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her
nephew; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she
sent him language so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for
272
some time all intercourse was at an end. But at length, by Elizabeth's
persuasion, he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a
reconciliation; and, after a little further resistance on the part of his
aunt, her resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her
curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended
to wait on them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods
had received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the
visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.
With the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms.
Darcy, as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever
sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing her into Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.

“From Pent-up Aching Rivers”
To the Reader
“What is love?” Shakespeare mused. The great bard was not the first to ask. I
suspect our ancestors pondered this question a million years ago as they sat
around their campfires or lay and watched the stars.
In this book I have tried to answer this seemingly unanswerable question.
Several things motivated me. I have loved and won and loved and lost; I have
certainly experienced the joy and agony of romantic love. Moreover, I am
convinced that this passion is a foundation stone of human social life, that just
about every human being who has ever lived has felt the ecstasy and the despair
of romantic love. Perhaps most important, a clearer understanding of this
whirlwind may help people find and sustain this glorious passion.
So in 1996 I began a multipart investigation to unravel that mystery of
mysteries, the experience of “being in love.” Why we love. Why we choose the
people that we choose. How men and women vary in their romantic feelings.
Love at first sight. Love and lust. Love and marriage. Animal love. How love
evolved. Love and hate. The brain in love. These became major themes of this
book. I also hoped to gain some insight into how we might control this
unpredictable and often dangerous fire in the heart.
Romantic love, I believe, is one of three primordial brain networks that
evolved to direct mating and reproduction. Lust, the craving for sexual
gratification, emerged to motivate our ancestors to seek sexual union with almost
any partner. Romantic love, the elation and obsession of “being in love,” enabled
them to focus their courtship attentions on a single individual at a time, thereby
conserving precious mating time and energy. And male-female attachment, the
feeling of calm, peace, and security one often has for a long-term mate, evolved
to motivate our ancestors to love this partner long enough to rear their young
together.
In short, romantic love is deeply embedded in the architecture and chemistry
of the human brain.
But what actually produces this thing called love?
To investigate this, I decided to make use of the newest technology for brain
scanning, known as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), to try to
record the brain activity of men and women who had just fallen madly in love.
For this important part of my investigation, I was fortunate to be joined by
two exceptionally gifted colleagues, Dr. Lucy L. Brown, a neuroscientist at the
Albert Einstein College of Medicine, and Dr. Arthur Aron, a research
psychologist at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. Debra
Mashek, then a doctoral candidate in psychology at SUNY Stony Brook, Greg
Strong, another SUNY psychology graduate student, and Dr. Haifang Li, a
radiologist at SUNY Stony Brook, all talented individuals, also played crucial
roles. Over a period of six years, we scanned the brains of more than forty men
and women who were wildly in love, collecting some one hundred forty-four
pictures of brain activity from each. Half of our participants were men and
women whose love was reciprocated; the rest had recently been rejected by
someone they adored. We wanted to record the range of feelings associated with
“being in love.”
The results were startling. We found gender differences that may help explain
why men respond so passionately to visual stimuli and why women can
remember details of the relationship. We discovered ways in which the brain in
love changes over time. We established some of the brain regions that become
active when you feel romantic ecstasy, information that suggests new ways to
sustain romance in long-term partnerships. I came to believe that animals feel a
form of romantic attraction for one another. Our findings shed new light on
stalking behavior and other crimes of passion. And I now understand more about
why we feel so depressed and angry when we are rejected, and even some ways
to stimulate the brain to soothe the anguish.
Most important, our results changed my thinking about the very essence of
romantic love. I came to see this passion as a fundamental human drive. Like the
craving for food and water and the maternal instinct, it is a physiological need, a
profound urge, an instinct to court and win a particular mating partner.
This drive to fall in love has produced some of humankind’s most compelling
operas, plays, and novels, our most touching poems and haunting melodies, the
world’s finest sculptures and paintings, and our most colorful festivals, myths,
and legends. Romantic love has adorned the world and brought many of us
tremendous joy. But when love is scorned, it can cause excruciating sorrow.
Stalking, homicide, suicide, profound depression from romantic rejection, and
high divorce and adultery rates are prevalent in societies around the world. It’s
time to seriously consider Shakespeare’s question: “What is love?”
I hope this book will be as useful to you as writing it has been to me, in our
mutual and eternal dance with this monumental force: the instinct to fall in love.

“What Wild Ecstasy”: Being in Love
The world, for me, and all the world can hold
Is circled by your arms; for me there lies,
Within the lights and shadows of your eyes,
The only beauty that is never old.
James Weldon Johnson
“Beauty That Is Never Old”
“Fires run through my body—the pain of loving you. Pain runs through my body
with the fires of my love for you. Sickness wanders my body with my love for
you. Pain like a boil about to burst with my love for you. Consumed by fire with
my love for you. I remember what you said to me. I am thinking of your love for
me. I am torn by your love for me. Pain and more pain. Where are you going
with my love? I’m told you will go from here. I am told you will leave me here.
My body is numb with grief. Remember what I’ve said, my love. Goodbye, my
love, goodbye.”
1 So spoke an anonymous Kwakiutl Indian of southern Alaska in
this wrenching poem, transcribed from the native tongue in 1896.
How many men and women have loved each other in all the seasons that
preceded you and me? How many of their dreams have been fulfilled; how many
of their passions wasted? Often as I walk or sit and contemplate, I wonder at all
the heartrending love affairs this planet has absorbed. Fortunately, men and
women around the world have left us a great deal of evidence of their romantic
lives.
From Uruk, in ancient Sumer, come poems on cuneiform tablets that hail the
passion of Inanna, Queen of Sumeria, for Dumuzi, a shepherd boy. “My beloved,
the delight of my eyes,” Inanna cried to him over four thousand years ago.
2
Vedic and other Indian texts, the earliest dating between 1000 and 700 B.C.,
tell of Shiva, the mythic Lord of the Universe, who was infatuated with Sati, a
young Indian girl. The god mused that “he saw Sati and himself on a mountain
pinnacle / enlaced in love.”
3
For some, happiness would never come. Such was Qays, the son of a tribal
chieftain in ancient Arabia. An Arabic legend, dating to the seventh century A.D.,
has it that Qays was a beautiful, brilliant boy—until he met Layla, meaning
“night” for her jet black hair.
4 So intoxicated was Qays that one day he sprang
from his school chair to race through the streets shouting out her name.
Henceforth he was known as Majnun, or madman. Soon Majnun began to drift
with the desert sand, living in caves with the animals, singing verses to his
beloved, while Layla, cloistered in her father’s tent, slipped out at night to toss
love notes to the wind. Sympathetic passersby would bring these appeals to the
wild-haired, almost-naked poet boy. Their mutual passion would eventually lead
to war between their tribes—and death to the lovers. Only this legend remains.
Meilan also lived by dying. In the twelfth century A.D. Chinese fable “The
Jade Goddess,” Meilan was the pampered fifteen-year-old daughter of a high
official in Kaifeng—until she fell in love with Chang Po, a vivacious lad with
long tapered fingers and a gift for carving jade. “Since the heaven and earth were
created, you were made for me and I was made for you and I will not let you
go,” Chang Po declared to Meilan one morning in her family’s garden.
5 These
lovers were of different classes in China’s rigid, hierarchical social order,
however. Desperate, they eloped—then were soon discovered. He escaped. She
was buried alive in her father’s garden. But the tale of Meilan still haunts the
souls of many Chinese.
Romeo and Juliet, Paris and Helen, Orpheus and Eurydice, Abelard and
Eloise, Troilus and Cressida, Tristan and Iseult: thousands of romantic poems,
songs, and stories come across the centuries from ancestral Europe, as well as
the Middle East, Japan, China, India, and every other society that has left written
records.
Even where people have no written documents, they have left evidence of
this passion. In fact, in a survey of 166 varied cultures, anthropologists found
evidence of romantic love in 147, almost 90 percent of them.
6
In the remaining
19 societies, scientists had simply failed to examine this aspect of people’s lives.
But from Siberia to the Australian Outback to the Amazon, people sing love
songs, compose love poems, and recount myths and legends of romantic love.
Many perform love magic—carrying amulets and charms or serving condiments
or concoctions to stimulate romantic ardor. Many elope. And many suffer deeply
from unrequited love. Some kill their lovers. Some kill themselves. Many sink
into a sorrow so profound that they can hardly eat or sleep.
From reading the poems, songs, and stories of people around the world, I
came to believe that the capacity for romantic love is woven firmly into the
fabric of the human brain. Romantic love is a universal human experience.
What is this volatile, often uncontrollable feeling that hijacks the mind,
bringing bliss one moment, despair the next?
7
The Love Survey
“O tell me the truth about love,” exclaimed poet W. H. Auden. To understand
what this profound human experience actually entails, I canvassed the
psychological literature on romantic love, culling those traits, symptoms, or
conditions that were mentioned repeatedly. Not surprising, this potent feeling is a
complex of many specific traits.
8
Then, to satisfy myself that these characteristics of romantic passion are
universal, I used them as the basis for a questionnaire I designed on romantic
love. And with the assistance of Michelle Cristiani, then a graduate student at
Rutgers University, as well as Dr. Mariko Hasagawa and Dr. Toshikazu
Hasagawa at the University of Tokyo, I distributed this survey among men and
women at and around Rutgers University in New Jersey and the University of
Tokyo.
The poll began: “This questionnaire is about ‘being in love,’ the feelings of
being infatuated, being passionate, or being strongly romantically attracted to
someone.
“If you are not currently ‘in love’ with someone, but felt very passionately
about someone in the past, please answer the questions with that person in
mind.” Participants were then asked several demographic questions, covering
age, financial background, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and marital
status. I also asked questions about their love affairs. Among them: “How long
have you been in love?” “About what percent of an average day does this person
come into your thoughts?” And “Do you sometimes feel as if your feelings are
out of your control?”
Then came the body of the questionnaire (see the Appendix). It contained
fifty-four statements, such as: “I have more energy when I am with _____.” “My
heart races when I hear _____’s voice on the phone.” And “When I’m in class/at
work my mind wanders to _____.” I designed all these questions to reflect the
characteristics most commonly associated with romantic love. Subjects were
required to indicate to what extent they agreed with each query on a seven-point
scale from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree.” A total of 437 Americans and
402 Japanese filled out the questionnaire. Then statisticians MacGregor Suzuki
and Tony Oliva assembled all these data and did a statistical analysis.
The results were astonishing. Age, gender, sexual orientation, religious
affiliation, ethnic group: none of these human variables made much difference in
the responses.
For example, people of different age groups answered with no significant
statistical differences on 82 percent of the statements. People over age forty-five
reported being just as passionate about their loved one as those under age
twenty-five. Heterosexuals and homosexuals gave similar responses on 86
percent of the questions. On 87 percent of the queries, American men and
women responded virtually alike: there were few gender differences. American
“whites” and “others” responded similarly on 86 percent of the questions: race
played almost no role in romantic zeal. Catholics and Protestants showed no
significant variance on 89 percent of the statements: church affiliation was not a
factor. And where these groups did show “statistically significant” differences in
their responses, one group was usually just a little more passionate than the
other.
The greatest differences were between the Americans and the Japanese. On
most of the forty-three questions where they showed statistically significant
variations, one nationality simply expressed somewhat greater romantic passion.
And the twelve questions showing dramatic differences all appeared to have
rather obvious cultural explanations. For example, only 24 percent of Americans
agreed with the statement, “When I am talking to _____, I am often afraid that I
will say the wrong thing,” whereas a whopping 65 percent of Japanese agreed
with this declaration. I suspect this particular variation occurred because young
Japanese often have fewer and more formal relations with the opposite sex than
Americans do. So, all things considered, within these two very different
societies, men and women were much alike in their feelings of romantic passion.
Romantic love. Obsessive love. Passionate love. Infatuation. Call it what you
will, men and women of every era and every culture have been “bewitched,
bothered, and bewildered” by this irresistible power. Being in love is universal to
humanity; it is part of human nature.
9
Moreover, this magic visits each of us in much the same way.
“Special Meaning”
One of the first things that happens when you fall in love is that you experience a
dramatic shift in consciousness: your “love object” takes on what psychologists
call “special meaning.” Your beloved becomes novel, unique, and all-important.
As one smitten man phrased it, “My whole world had been transformed. It had a
new center, and that center was Marilyn.”
10 Shakespeare’s Romeo expressed this
feeling more succinctly, saying of his adored one, “Juliet is the sun.”
Before the relationship grows into romantic love, you may feel attracted to
several different individuals, addressing your attention to one, then another. But
eventually you begin to concentrate your passion on just one. Emily Dickinson
called this private world “the realm of you.”
This phenomenon is related to the human inability to feel romantic passion
for more than one person at a time. In my survey, 79 percent of men and 87
percent of women said they would not go out on a romantic date with someone
else when their beloved was unavailable (Appendix, #19).
Focussed Attention
The love-possessed person focusses almost all of his or her attention on the
beloved, often to the detriment of everything and everyone around them,
including work, family, and friends. Ortega y Gasset, the Spanish philosopher,
called this “an abnormal state of attention which occurs in a normal man.” This
focussed attention is a central aspect of romantic love.
Infatuated men and women also concentrate on all of the events, songs,
letters, and other little things they have come to associate with the beloved. The
time he stopped in the park to show her a spring bud; the evening she tossed
lemons to him as he made the drinks: to the love-possessed, these casual instants
breathe. Seventy-three percent of the men and 85 percent of the women in my
survey remembered trivial things that their beloved said and did (Appendix,
#46). And 83 percent of men and 90 percent of women replayed these precious
episodes in their mind’s eye as they mused about their dearest (Appendix, #52).
Billions of other lovers have probably felt a surge of tenderness when
thinking of moments spent with a sweetheart. A touching Asian example of this
comes from a ninth-century Chinese poem, “The Bamboo Mat,” by Yuan Chen.
Chen agonized, “I cannot bear to put away the bamboo sleeping mat: that night I
brought you home, / I watched you roll it out.”
11 For Chen, an everyday object
had acquired iconic power.
The twelfth-century tale Lancelot, by Chrétien de Troyes, illustrates this
same aspect of romantic passion. In this epic, Lancelot finds Queen Guinevere’s
comb lying in the road after she and her entourage have passed. Several of her
golden hairs are tangled in its teeth. As de Troyes wrote, “He began to adore the
hairs; a hundred thousand times he touched them to his eyes, his mouth, his
forehead, and his cheeks.”
12
Aggrandizing the Beloved
The infatuated person also begins to magnify, even aggrandize tiny aspects of the
adored one. If pressed, almost all lovers can list the things they do not like about
their amor. But they cast these perceptions aside or persuade themselves that
these defects are unique and charming. “So lovers manage in their passion’s
cause / To love their ladies even for their flaws,” mused Molière. Quite so. Some
even adore their beloved for their faults.
And lovers dote on the positive qualities of their sweethearts, flagrantly
disregarding reality.
13
It’s life through rose-colored glasses, what psychologists
call the “pink-lens effect.” Virginia Woolf described this myopic view vividly,
saying, “But love … it’s only an illusion. A story one makes up in one’s mind
about another person. And one knows all the time it isn’t true. Of course one
knows; why one’s always taking care not to destroy the illusion.”
Our sample of Americans and Japanese certainly illustrates this pink-lens
effect. Some 65 percent of men and 55 percent of women in the survey agreed
with the statement: “_____ has some faults but they don’t really bother me”
(Appendix, #3). And 64 percent of men and 64 percent of women agreed with
the statement, “I love everything about _____” (Appendix, #10).
How we delude ourselves when we love. Chaucer was right: “Love is blynd.”
“Intrusive Thinking”
One of the primary symptoms of romantic love is obsessive meditation about the
beloved. It is known to psychologists as “intrusive thinking.” You simply can’t
get your beloved out of your head.
Examples of intrusive thinking abound in world literature. The fourthcentury Chinese poet, Tzu Yeh, wrote, “How can I not think of you—.”
14 An
anonymous eighth-century Japanese poet moaned, “My longing has no time
when it ceases.” Giraut de Borneil, a troubadour of twelfth-century France, sang
out, “Through too much loving … So terribly do my thoughts torment me.”
15
And a Maori native of New Zealand expressed his suffering with these words: “I
lie awake the livelong night, / For love to prey on me in secret.”
Perhaps the most striking example of intrusive thinking, however, comes
from Wolfram von Eschenbach’s medieval masterpiece, Parzifal. In this story,
Parzifal was cantering along on his steed when he saw three drops of blood in
the winter snow, shed by a wild duck that had been wounded by a falcon. It
reminded him of the crimson and alabaster complexion of his wife,
Condwiramurs. Transfixed, Parzifal sat in contemplation, frozen in his stirrups.
“And thus he mused, lost in thought, until his senses / deserted him. Mighty love
held him in thrall.”
16
Unfortunately, Parzifal was holding his lance erect—a chivalric signal of
challenge. Soon two knights who were camped in a nearby meadow with King
Arthur took notice and galloped out to joust with him. Not until one of Parzifal’s
followers draped a yellow scarf over the drops of blood did he shake off his love
trance, lower his weapon, and stave off a deadly battle.
Mighty is love. Not surprisingly, 79 percent of the men and 78 percent of the
women in my survey reported that when they were in class or at work their mind
returned continually to their beloved (Appendix, #24). And 47 percent of men
and 50 percent of women agreed that “no matter where it starts, my mind always
seems to end up thinking about_____” (Appendix, #36). Other surveys report
similar findings. Informants report they think about their “love object” over 85
percent of their waking hours.
17
How apt of Milton in Paradise Lost to have Eve say to Adam, “With thee
conversing, I forget all time.”
Emotional Fire
Of the 839 American and Japanese people in my survey of romantic love, 80
percent of men and 79 percent of women agreed with the statement, “When I
feel certain that _____ is passionate about me, I feel lighter than air” (Appendix,
#32).
No single aspect of “being in love” is so familiar to the stricken lover as the
torrent of intense emotions that pour through the mind. Some become painfully
shy or awkward when in the presence of the beloved. Some turn pale. Some
flush. Some tremble. Some stammer. Some sweat. Some get weak knees, feel
dizzy, or have “butterflies in the stomach.” Others report quickened breathing.
And many report feelings of fire in the heart.
Catullus, the Roman poet, was certainly swept away. Writing to his beloved,
he said, “You make me crazy. Seeing you, My Lesbia, takes my breath away. My
tongue freezes, my body / is filled with flames.”
18 Ono No Komachi, a ninthcentury female Japanese poet, wrote, “I lie awake, hot / the growing fires of
passion / bursting, blazing in my heart.”
19 The woman in the Song of Songs, the
Hebrew love lyrics composed between 900 and 300 B.C., bemoaned, “I am faint
with love.”
20 And American poet Walt Whitman described this emotional
whirlwind perfectly, saying, “That furious storm through me careering—I
passionately trembling.”
21
Lovers ride a kite of exhilaration so swift that many find it difficult to eat or
sleep.
Intense Energy
Loss of appetite and sleeplessness are directly related to another of love’s
overwhelming sensations: tremendous energy. As a young man on the South
Pacific island of Mangaia told an anthropologist, when he thought of his
beloved, he “felt like jumping in the sky!”
22 Sixty-four percent of the men and 68
percent of the women in our survey also reported that their hearts raced when
they heard their beloved’s voice on the phone (Appendix, #9). And 77 percent of
men and 76 percent of women reported that they had a surge of energy when
they were with their beloved (Appendix, #17).
Bards, minstrels, poets, playwrights, novelists: men and women have sung
for centuries of this energizing chemistry, as well as the awkward stammering
and nervousness, the pounding heart and breathlessness that can accompany
romantic love. But of all who have discussed this psychic and physical
pandemonium, none has been as graphic as Andreas Capellanus, or Andreas the
Chaplain, a learned Frenchman of the 1180s who traveled in high courtly circles
and wrote On the Art of Honorable Loving, a literary classic of the times.
It was during his century that the tradition of courtly love emerged in France.
This conventionalized code prescribed the conduct of the lover toward the
beloved. The lover was frequently a troubadour—a highly educated poet,
musician, and singer, often of knightly rank. His beloved was, in many cases, a
woman wed to the lord of a distinguished European household. These
troubadours composed, then sang highly romantic verse to worship and flatter
the lady of the house.
Yet these “romances” were expected to be chaste—and rigidly observant of
complex codes of chivalrous conduct. So in his book, Capellanus codified the
rules of courtly love. Unknowingly, he also listed many of the primary traits of
romantic love, among them the lover’s inner turbulence. As he aptly expressed
it, “On suddenly catching sight of his beloved, the heart of the lover begins to
palpitate.” “Every lover regularly turns pale in the presence of his beloved.”
23
And “A man tormented by the thought of love eats and sleeps very little.”
24
This sophisticated churchman also spoke of the “intrusive thinking” that
lovers experience, declaring, “Everything a lover does ends in the thought of his
beloved.” And “A true lover is continually and without interruption obsessed by
the image of his beloved.” He also clearly recognized that the lover focusses all
of his or her attention on a single person when they love, saying, “No one can
love two people at the same time.”
25
Fundamental aspects of romantic love have not changed nearly a thousand
years later.
Mood Swings: From Ecstasy to Despair
“He drifts on blue water / under the clear moon, picking white lilies on South
Lake. Every lotus blossom speaks of love until his heart will break.”
26 For the
eighth-century Chinese poet Li Po, romance was painful.
Feelings of love soar and dive. If the beloved showers the lover with
attention, if he or she calls regularly, writes affectionate e-mails, or joins the
lover for an afternoon or evening of food and frolic, then glows the world. But if
the adored one seems indifferent, shows up late or not at all, fails to respond to
e-mails, phone calls, or letters, or sends some other negative signal, the lover
begins to feel despair. Listless, depressed, such wooers mope until they can
account for the loved one’s actions, relieve their trampled hearts, and renew the
chase.
Romantic passion can produce a variety of dizzying mood changes ranging
from exhilaration when one’s love is returned to anxiety, despair, or even rage
when one’s romantic ardor is ignored or rejected. As the Swiss writer Henri
Frédéric Arniel put it, “The more a man loves, the more he suffers.” The Tamil
peoples of South India even have a name for this malaise. They call this state of
romantic suffering mayakkam, meaning intoxication, dizziness, and delusion.
It came as no surprise to me that 72 percent of the men and 77 percent of the
women in my survey did not agree with the statement, “_______’s behavior has
no effect on my emotional well-being” (Appendix, #41). And 68 percent of men
and 56 percent of women supported the statement, “My emotional state depends
on how _______ feels about me” (Appendix, #37).
Yearning for Emotional Union
“Come to me in my dreams, and then By day I shall be well again. For so the
night will more than pay / the hopeless longing of the day.”
27 Lovers crave
emotional union with a beloved, as poet Matthew Arnold knew.
28 Without this
connection to a sweetheart, they feel acutely incomplete or hollow, as if an
essential part of them is missing.
This overwhelming need for emotional union so characteristic of the lover is
memorably expressed in The Symposium, Plato’s account of a dinner party held
in Athens in 416 B.C. On this festive evening some of the greatest minds of
classical Greece convened to dine in the home of Agathon. As they reclined on
their couches, one guest proposed that they amuse themselves with a topic of
sportive discussion: each would take his turn describing and praising the god of
love.
All agreed. The flute-girl was dismissed. Then one by one, they took their
turns eulogizing the god of love. Some regarded this supernatural figure as the
most “ancient,” the most “honored,” or the most “undiscriminating” of all the
gods. Others maintained that the god of love was “young,” “sensitive,”
“powerful,” or “good.” Not Socrates. He began his homage by recounting his
dialogue with Diotima, a wise woman from Mantinea. Speaking of the god of
love, she told Socrates, “He always lives in a state of need.”
29
“A state of need.” Perhaps no single phrase in all of literature so clearly
captures the essence of passionate romantic love: Need. In my survey, 86 percent
of men and 84 percent of women agreed with the statement, “I deeply hope
_____ is as attracted to me as I am to him/her” (Appendix, #30).
This craving to merge with the beloved pervades world literature. The sixthcentury A.D. Roman poet Paulus Silentiarius wrote, “And there lay the lovers, liplocked delirious, infinitely thirsting, each wanting to go completely inside the
other.”
30 Yvor Winters, the twentieth-century American poet, wrote, “May our
heirs seal us in a single urn, / A single spirit never to return.”
31 And Milton
expressed this perfectly in Paradise Lost when Adam says to Eve, “We are one, /
One flesh; to lose thee were to lose myself.”
Philosopher Robert Solomon believes this intense desire is the primary
reason the lover says, “I love you.” This is not statement of fact but a request for
confirmation. The lover yearns to hear those potent words, “I love you, too.”
32
So deep is this need for emotional union with the beloved that psychologists
believe the lover’s sense of self becomes blurred. As Freud said, “At its height,
the state of being in love threatens to obliterate the boundaries between ego and
object.”
Novelist Joyce Carol Oates vividly caught this feeling of blissful fusion,
writing, “If they turn suddenly toward us we draw back the skin shudders wetly,
finely will we be torn into two people?”
Looking for Clues
When lovers don’t know whether their love is cherished and returned, however,
they become hypersensitive to the cues that the adored one sends. As Robert
Graves wrote, “Listening for a knock, waiting for a sign.” In my survey, 79
percent of men and 83 percent of women reported that when they were strongly
attracted to someone, they dissected their beloved’s actions, looking for clues
about his or her feelings toward them (Appendix, #21). And 62 percent of men
and 51 percent of women said that they sometimes searched for alternative
meanings to their beloved’s words and gestures (Appendix, #28).
Changing Priorities
Many infatuated people also change their clothing styles, their mannerisms, their
habits, sometimes even their values to win the beloved. A new interest in golf,
tango lessons, antique collecting, a new hair style, Mozart instead of Country
Western music, even moving to a new city or starting a new career: love-struck
men and women adopt all manner of novel interests, beliefs, and lifestyles in
order to please their dearest ones.
The twelfth-century champion of courtly love, Andreas Capellanus, summed
up this impulse, penning the words, “Love can deny nothing to love.”
33 While a
love-besotted American man put it bluntly, “Anything that she liked, I liked.”
34
He was one of many. Seventy-nine percent of American men and 70 percent of
American women in our survey agreed with the statement, “I like to keep my
schedule open so that if _____ is free, we can see each other”(Appendix, #47).
Lovers rearrange their lives to accommodate a beloved.
Emotional Dependence
Lovers also become dependent on the relationship, very dependent. As
Shakespeare’s Antony declared to Cleopatra, “My heart was to thy rudder tied
by the strings.” An ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic poem described the same
dependency, saying, “My heart would be a slave / should she enfold me.”
35 The
twelfth-century troubadour Arnaut Daniel wrote, “I am hers from head to foot.”
36
But Keats was the most impassioned, writing, “Still, still to hear her tender-taken
breath, / And so live ever—or else swoon to death.”
Because lovers are so dependent on a beloved, they suffer terrible
“separation anxiety” when they are out of touch. An anonymous Japanese poem,
written in the tenth century, aches with this despair. “Early morning glows in the
faint shimmer of first light. Choked with sadness, / I help you into your
clothes.”
37
Lovers are puppets dangling from the heartstrings of another.
Empathy
As a result, lovers often feel tremendous empathy for the beloved. In my survey,
64 percent of men and 76 percent of women agreed with the statement, “I feel
happy when _____ is happy and sad when he/she is sad” (Appendix, #11).
Poet e. e. cummings wrote charmingly of this, saying, “she laughed his joy
she cried his grief.” Many lovers are even willing to sacrifice themselves for
their sweetheart. Perhaps Adam’s sacrifice for Eve is the most dramatic offering
of any in Western literature. As Milton described it, upon discovering that Eve
has eaten the forbidden apple, Adam chooses to eat the apple himself—which he
knows will lead to his expulsion with her from the Garden of Eden and death.
Adam says, “for with thee / Certain my resolution is to die.”
38
Adversity Heightens Passion
Adversity often feeds the flame. I call this curious phenomenon “frustrationattraction” but it is better known as the “Romeo and Juliet effect.” Social or
physical barriers kindle romantic passion.
39 They enable one to discard the facts
and focus on the terrific qualities of the other. Even arguments or temporary
breakups can be stimulating.
One of the funniest literary examples of how adversity heightens romance is
Chekhov’s one-act play, The Bear.
40
In this drama, an ill-tempered landowner, Grigory Stepanovich Smirnov,
appears at the home of a young widow to collect money owed him by her dead
husband. The woman refuses to pay a single kopek. She is in mourning, she
explains, and curtly shouts at him, “I am in no mood to concern myself with
monetary matters.” This sends Smirnov into a tirade against all women—calling
them hypocrites, phonies, gossips, scandalmongers, haters, slanderers, liars,
petty, fussy, ruthless, and illogical. “Brrrr!” he sputters, “I’m shaking with fury.”
His rage triggers her anger and they begin to shout insults at each other. Soon he
calls for a duel. Itching to put a hole in his head, the widow retrieves her dead
husband’s pistols and they take their positions.
But as their rancor builds, so does mutual respect—and attraction. Suddenly
Smirnov exclaims, “Now this is what a woman is! This I understand! A real
woman! This is not a whiner, this is not a wimp, this is a fireball, a rocket, this is
gunpowder! A shame to have to kill her, though!” A moment later he declares
undying love and asks her to be his wife. As her servants rush into the drawing
room to defend their mistress with axes, rakes, and pitchforks, they stumble on
the lovers—swept up in a mad embrace.
This odd relationship between adversity and romantic ardor is seen in all the
star-crossed lovers of the world’s great legends. Fueled by difficulties of one
kind or another, they just love all the harder.
The most familiar Western story of this kind, of course, is Shakespeare’s
tragic tale Romeo and Juliet. These young lovers of sixteenth-century Verona are
caught in a bitter feud between two powerful families, the Montagues and the
Capulets. Romeo is a Montague, Juliet a Capulet. Yet Romeo falls in love with
Juliet the moment he sees her at a family party, exclaiming, “O, she doth teach
the torches to burn bright! / Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight! / For I
ne’er saw true beauty till this night.”
41 Juliet, too, succumbs to Cupid’s arrow. As
Romeo departs the banquet, she asks her nurse, “Go ask his name. If he be
married, / My grave is like to be my wedding bed.”
42 The play unfolds with a
series of obstacles and confusions that only intensify their passion.
Sixty-five percent of the men and 73 percent of the women in my survey
agreed with the statement, “I never give up loving __________, even when
things are going poorly” (Appendix, #26). And 75 percent of men and 77 percent
of women agreed with the statement, “When the relationship with __________
has a setback, I just try harder to get things going right” (Appendix, #6).
One of my unexpected survey results is almost certainly attributable to the
role of adversity in love. Homosexual respondents, both gay men and lesbians,
reported more emotional turmoil than did heterosexuals. These individuals were
more bedeviled by insomnia, loss of appetite, and the yearning for emotional
union with a beloved. I think this psychic distress occurs, at least in part, because
of the social barriers that many homosexual lovers must surmount.
Those who answered my questionnaire while thinking about a former lover
also seemed more emotionally fragile. They, too, had a harder time eating and
sleeping. They were more shy and awkward around their former sweetheart.
They suffered more “intrusive thinking” and more mood swings. And they more
often reported having a racing heart when thinking about their old flame. I
suspect that many of these respondents had been rejected by their beloved—and
this adversity heightened their romantic zeal.
Like rowboats on a troubled sea, both men and women ride the swells of
anguish and exhilaration that are romantic love. And barriers intensify these
emotions. If your beloved is married to someone else, if he or she lives across an
ocean, if you speak different languages, come from different ethnic groups, or
just come from different parts of town, this obstacle can heighten romantic
passion. Dickens said of this, “Love often attains its most luxuriant growth in
separation and under circumstances of the utmost difficulty.” Alas, ’tis true.
Hope
“Say that I might live in hope,” King Pyrrhus pleads with Andromache in
Racine’s drama of love and death. Why do lovers continue to hope, even when
the dice of life come up relentlessly against them? Most still hope the
relationship will spring back to life—even years after it has ended bitterly. Hope
is another predominant trait of romantic love.
A charming sixteenth-century poem by Michael Drayton expresses this
optimism. It begins, “Since there’s no help, come, let us kiss and part! Nay, I
have done, you get no more of me; And I am glad, yea, glad with all my heart,
That thus so cleanly I myself can free. Shake hands for ever, cancel all our vows;
And when we meet at any time again, Be it not seen in either of our brows, That
we one jot of former love retain.” With these words Drayton declares, with
apparent confidence, that the affair is finally and easily finished. Yet at the very
end of the poem, he suddenly changes his tune. Overcome by hope, he argues
that “Love” can be still be saved: “Now, if thou wouldst, when all have given
him over, From death to life thou might’st him yet recover.”
43
I think this tendency to hope became implanted in the human brain eons ago
so our ancient forebears would doggedly pursue potential mates until the last
flicker of possibility had expired.
A Sexual Connection
“I would rather die a hundred times than be without your sweet lovemaking. I
love you. I love you desperately. I love you as I love my own soul.”
44 So
declared Psyche to her husband, Eros, in The Golden Ass, the second-century
novel by Apuleius. “Burning with desire,” the tale continues, “she leaned over
and kissed him impulsively, impetuously, with kiss after kiss after kiss, fearful he
would waken before she had finished.”
45
Poetry from around the world attests to the lover’s intense craving for sexual
union with the beloved, another basic characteristic of romantic love.
In the Song of Solomon, the woman calls out, “O north wind, awake. South
wind, rise up. Blow on my garden and let my spices flow. Let my love enter his
garden / and eat his sweet fruit.”
46
Inanna, queen of ancient Sumeria, was
enraptured by Dumuzi’s sexuality, saying, “O Dumuzi! Your fullness is my
delight!”
47 But the sweetest to my ear is the anonymous old English poem that
wails, “Western wind, when wilt thou blow? / The small rain down can rain,—
Christ, if my love were in my arms And I in my bed again!”
Freud, as well as many scholars and laymen, maintained that sexual desire is
a central component of romantic love.
48 Hardly a new idea. Those who study the
Kama Sutra, the love manual of fifth-century India, know that the word “love”
comes from the Sanskrit, “Lubh,” meaning “to desire.”
It certainly makes sense that feelings of romantic love are intertwined with
sexual craving. After all, if romantic passion evolved among our forebears in
order to motivate them to focus their mating energy on a “special” individual at
least until insemination had been completed (as I will maintain in subsequent
chapters), then romantic passion must be linked with sexual desire.
The results of my survey support this proposition. A substantial 73 percent of
the men and 65 percent of the women daydreamed about having sex with their
beloved (Appendix, #34).
Sexual Exclusivity
Lovers also crave sexual exclusivity. They do not wish to have their “sacred”
relationship sullied by outsiders. When someone hops in bed with “just a friend,”
they often don’t much care if this bed partner is also coupling with another. But
once a man or woman falls in love and begins to yearn for emotional union with
a sweetheart, they profoundly want this mate to remain sexually faithful—to
them.
Many of the world’s love stories reflect this sexual possessiveness, as well as
the lover’s desire to maintain his or her sexual fidelity. For example, while
estranged from Iseult the Fair, Tristan wed another woman with a similar name,
Iseult of the Fair Hands—largely because this woman bore much of his
beloved’s appellation. But Tristan could not bring himself to consummate the
marriage. When, in the Arabian legend, Layla was betrothed to someone other
than her beloved Majnun, she, too, avoided the wedding bed. And some 80
percent of the men and 88 percent of the women in my survey agreed with the
statement, “Being sexually faithful is important when you are in love”
(Appendix, #42).
Of all the properties of romantic love, this longing for sexual exclusivity is
the most interesting to me. It probably evolved for two essential reasons: to
protect ancestral men from being cuckolded and raising another’s child; and to
protect ancestral women from losing to a rival a potential husband and father to
her children. This craving for sexual exclusivity enabled our forebears to protect
their precious DNA as they expended almost all their time and energy courting
someone they adored.
But along with a drive to ensure sexual fidelity during courtship came a less
appealing trait of romantic love, Shakespeare’s “green ey’d monster,” jealousy.
Jealousy: The “Nurse of Love”
In his book on the rules of courtly love, Capellanus wrote, “He who does not feel
jealousy is not capable of loving.” He called jealousy the “nurse of love”
because he believed it nourished romantic fire.
49
This insightful cleric, as usual, had it right. In every society where
anthropologists have studied romantic passion, they report that both sexes get
jealous, very jealous.
50 As the I Ching, the Chinese book of wisdom written over
three thousand years ago, warned, “A close bond is possible only between two
persons; a group of three engenders jealousy.”
51
Emotional Union Trumps Sexual Union
But even the desire for sexual intercourse and the craving for sexual fidelity are
less important to the lover than the longing for emotional union with the
beloved. The love-stricken man or woman wants the beloved to call and say, “I
adore you,” to bring flowers or some other token gift, to invite them to a ball
game or the theater, to laugh and hug and shower them with attention. The lover
aches to have his or her love returned. This yearning for emotional togetherness
far surpasses the desire for mere sexual release.
Seventy-five percent of the men and 83 percent of the women in my survey
agreed with the statement, “Knowing that __________ is ‘in love’ with me is
more important to me than having sex with him/her” (Appendix, #50).
Involuntary, Uncontrollable Love
“Behold a deity stronger than I, who, coming, will rule me from that time
forward. Love quite governed my soul.”
52 Dante wrote these words in the
thirteenth century to describe the moment he first saw Beatrice. He knew the
dominating force of romantic love. Indeed, at the core of this obsession is its
power: romantic love is often unplanned, involuntary, and seemingly
uncontrollable.
How many lovers have felt this magnetic pull?
Billions, probably.
“The Jade Goddess,” the twelfth-century Chinese romance, says of Chang Po
and Meilan, “The more they tried to stop the love that had been awakened, the
more they felt themselves in its power.”
53 And in twelfth-century France,
Chrétien de Troyes wrote of Guinevere in Lancelot, “In spite of herself she was
forced to love.”
54
But insights into the irresistible nature of romantic attraction have not been
confined to the literary imagination. An American business executive in his
fifties wrote of an office colleague, “I am advancing toward the thesis that this
attraction for Emily is a kind of biological, instinct-like action. That it is not
under voluntary or logical control. It directs me. I try desperately to argue with
it, to limit its influence, to channel it, to deny it, to enjoy it, and, yes, damn it, to
make her respond! Even though I know that Emily and I have absolutely no
chance of making a life together, the thought of her is an obsession.”
55
Even the sober-sided American Founding Father, George Washington, knew
the pull of romantic love. In 1795 he wrote a letter to his step-granddaughter
advising her to beware lest love become “an involuntary passion.”
56
Contemporary men and women also feel the helplessness that accompanies
this experience. Sixty percent of the men and 70 percent of the women in my
survey agreed with the statement, “Falling in love was not really a choice; it just
struck me” (Appendix, #49).
A Transient State
But as love arrives unbidden, it can also steal away. As Violetta, in Verdi’s tragic
opera La Traviata, sings, “Let’s live for pleasure alone, since love, like flowers,
swiftly fades.”
Plato knew this aspect of the god of love, saying, “By nature he is neither
immortal nor mortal. Sometimes on a single day he shoots into life … then dies,
and then … comes back to life again.”
57 Love is fickle, volatile, inconstant; it can
expire, then rekindle, then fade away again.
How long does love’s magic last?
No one knows. A team of neuroscientists recently concluded that romantic
love normally lasts between twelve and eighteen months.
58 As you will see in
chapter three, our study of the brain suggests love can last at least seventeen
months. But I would bet that love’s duration varies dramatically, depending on
the cast of characters involved. Most people have felt a passing infatuation that
lasted only days or weeks. And as you know, when there is a barrier to the
relationship, this flame can burn for many years. Adversity stimulates romantic
ardor.
59
But this fire in the heart does tend to diminish as partners settle into the daily
joys of togetherness, often replaced by another elegant circuit in the brain:
attachment—the feelings of serenity and union with one’s beloved.
Love’s Many Forms
Of course, romantic love can take a variety of forms. You can wake up alone in
the middle of the night with feelings of abandonment and despair. Then you get
a call or e-mail from your lover in the morning and your hopes begin to soar.
Then you meet your sweetheart for dinner and talk and laugh and your ecstasy
turns to sensations of security and peace. After supper you climb into bed to read
together and soon you are overcome by lust. Then in the morning your beloved
dashes off, forgetting to say goodbye, even breaks a forthcoming date or calls
you by another’s name—and you plunge into despondency again.
“What mad pursuit? What struggle to escape? What pipes and timbrels What
wild ecstasy?” John Keats clearly knew that romantic love is a tumult of wildly
different motivations and emotions that mix to form myriad states of mind.
Compassion, ecstasy, desire, fear, suspicion, jealousy, doubt, awkwardness,
embarrassment: at any moment this kaleidoscope of feelings can shift, then shift
again.
“Passions are liken’d best to floods and streams,” wrote Sir Walter Raleigh.
60
We swim these tides. But psychologists generally distinguish between two basic
types of romantic love: reciprocated love—associated with fulfillment and
ecstasy; and unrequited love—associated with emptiness, anxiety, and sorrow.
61
Almost all of us know both the agony and elation of romantic love.
We are not alone. In his book The Expression of the Emotions in Man and
Animals, Charles Darwin hypothesized that human beings share many of their
feelings with “lower” anirnals.
62
Indeed, many furred and feathered beings who
share this planet seem to feel some version of romantic passion.

Animal Magnetism: Love among the Animals
Unwearied still, lover by lover,
They paddle in the cold
Companionable streams or climb the air;
Their hearts have not grown old;
Passion or conquest, wander where they will,
Attend upon them still.
William Butler Yeats
“The Wild Swans at Coole”
As February blizzards cloak the meadows of Hokkaido, Japan, in winter white, a
male red fox begins to fixate on a vixen, gazing at her intently, following
obsessively. Pausing as she rests, he leaps to lick and nibble at her face, then
frolics at her side as she lopes along. A skunky fragrance emanates from his
urine in the snow. It is mating time. And as this musky odor wafts through the
brittle cold, the couple court and copulate over and over for about two weeks.
Then they scent-mark their territory in the woods and fields and excavate several
dens where they will rear their young.
Do foxes love?
Excessive energy, focussed attention on a partner, dogged pursuit, and all the
tender licks and nibbles that foxes bestow on one another are certainly
reminiscent of human romantic love. And foxes are but one of many species that
show aspects of romance.
At the beginning of the breeding season or a mating bout, many choose
specific partners, then center their attention on this “special” individual, often to
the exclusion of all around them. Devotedly, they follow “him” or “her.” They
stroke, kiss, nip, nuzzle, pat, tap, lick, tug, or playfully chase this chosen one.
Some sing. Some whinny. Some squeak, croak, or bark. Some dance. Some strut.
Some preen. Some chase. Most play. On the grasslands of Africa’s Serengeti, in
the jungles of Amazonia, on the tundras of the Arctic, creatures great and small
show excessive energy as they woo. Adversity heightens their pursuit—just as
barriers intensify romantic passion in people. And many become possessive—
jealously guarding this mate from other suitors until their breeding time has
passed.
These courtship traits are similar to some characteristics of romantic passion
in humans. So I think animals love. Most creatures probably feel this magnetism
for only seconds; others appear to be infatuated for hours, days, or weeks. But
animals feel some sort of attraction to “special” others. Many even fall in love at
first sight. From this “animal attraction” I believe human romantic love would
eventually emerge.
Animal Attraction
“It was evidently a case of love at first sight, for she swam about the new-comer
caressingly … with overtures of affection.”
1 Charles Darwin was describing a
female mallard duck who had become infatuated with a male pintail duck—a
duck of a different species. We all make mistakes.
Darwin believed that animals feel attraction to one another. A male
blackbird, a female thrush, a black grouse, a pheasant, these and many other
birds, he reported, “fell in love with one another.”
2
In fact, Darwin maintained
that all the higher animals share “similar passions, affections and emotions, even
the more complex ones, such as jealousy, suspicion, emulation, gratitude and
magnanimity.” They “even have a sense of humour; wonder and curiosity.”
Darwin is among very few scientists who have maintained that animals feel
love for one another. Naturalists regularly describe anger and fear in other
creatures. They see animals frolic and believe these beasts are feeling joy. They
describe expressions of surprise, timidity, curiosity, and disgust. They even
report moments of empathy and jealousy. Yet scientists rarely say that animals
love, even though descriptions of animal courtship are filled with references to
behaviors that are akin to human romantic passion.
African elephants are good examples. The female African elephant comes
into an estrus (or heat) for about five consecutive days at any time during the
year. If she conceives during this mating romp, her sexuality is suppressed
during her twenty-two months of pregnancy and the following two years of
nursing. Most do not mate again for about four years. So these females are
particular about their mating partners. They prefer some; they refuse others. And
female elephants have many admirers to choose from. Male African elephants
leave their matriarchal natal group shortly after puberty (which occurs between
ages ten and twelve) to wander with other males in small “all-bull” communities.
But not until around age thirty does a male come into “musth,” or male heat.
Musth is a dramatic advertisement of sexuality. If you think women in tight
short skirts, low-cut blouses, and high-heeled shoes are flaunting their erotic
desire, you should see male elephants. As a male comes into musth, which
generally lasts two to three months of every year, he begins to excrete a viscous
fluid from bulging glands that lie midway between his eye and ear on either side.
He dribbles urine continually. His penis sheath becomes thick with green-white
scum. He exudes an odor so pungent that females can smell him before they see
him. And as he approaches a female herd he starts his courtship strut, his “musth
walk.” Head high, chin tucked in, ears tensely waving, trunk aloft, he emits a
low rumble of confidence as he strides by.
Female elephants find all these drippings, this male perfume, and the “musth
walk” exceedingly attractive. Those in estrus draw close like girls to rock stars.
Such was Tia. During the many years that naturalist Cynthia Moss followed
Tia’s matriarchal group of African elephants across the Amboseli National Park
in Kenya, she saw many females choose their mates the way Tia did.
Tia showed no interest in any of the young males who began to crowd
around her as her period of estrus became noticeable. Off she trotted as they
pursued her across the grass. Because female elephants are about half the size of
males, an experienced one can outrun or outmaneuver almost any male she
wishes to avoid. Tia did just that. But when Tia saw Bad Bull, a dominant, older
male in the height of musth, she changed her elephant mind.
Tia wanted Bad Bull the moment he swaggered into view—with ooze
dripping from his cheeks, urine streaming down his legs, and foam spraying
from his penis sheath. One whiff of this stud and the younger males moved off.
Not Tia. Tia looked up at Bad Bull, holding her ears high in an estrous pose.
Then she, too, began to move away. But unlike her conduct with her young male
suitors, Tia looked over her shoulder as she departed, glancing repeatedly to see
if Bad Bull was following. He was. Off Tia sped with Bad Bull in pursuit.
Now nature’s timeless dance would start. As Bad Bull caught up to Tia, his
almost-four-foot penis emerged from its long gray sheath. Then delicately he
placed his trunk along her back. She stopped; stood still; then backed toward him
and braced herself, motionless, legs apart. He mounted energetically and, using
his versatile penile muscles to direct his thrust, he sank his organ into her vulva.
Together they stood for some forty-five seconds before Bad Bull dismounted.
Withdrawing, he gushed his remaining semen onto the dirt. Tia turned to stand
beside him. Repeatedly she emitted long low rumbles at him; then she rubbed
her head along his shoulder.
Tia and Bad Bull were inseparable for the next three days, patting and
stroking constantly between bouts of copulation. But when Tia’s estrus waned,
Bad Bull departed to search for other fertile females. As Moss wrote in her
marvelous book, Elephant Memories, “Personally, I cannot imagine why Tia
wanted to mate with Bad Bull, but then she may have seen something in him that
I did not.”
3
Could it be love? A temporary crush? An infatuation? Tia and Bad Bull
focussed their attention entirely on each other. Both displayed intense energy.
Neither ate or slept as regularly as elephants do. And they touched and “talked”
in low, soft, long, rumbling elephant conversation. Tia seemed to feel a genuine,
if temporary, attraction to this proud, healthy, virile male.
The love lives of beavers are less visible. But these creatures also show signs
of intense attraction as they court and mate. Take Skipper, for example. Skipper
grew up on Lily Pond in Harriman State Park, New York, under the tutelage of
his father, the “Inspector General,” and his mother, “Lily.”
Beavers live in small family groups. They work and romp at night. And kits
stay with their parents for about two years before they waddle off some spring
night to find mates and build homes of their own. Skipper did just that; he
departed with his sister, Laurel, one moon-strewn April evening. Inbreeding is
common among beavers, and that evening the two siblings moved to a nearby
valley to construct a dam and grow a pond. Soon the water rose. Insects began to
hatch, attracting frogs, waxwings, and king birds. Fish spawned, a dinner bell to
hungry grebes. Willows, alders, and yellow iris spread along the banks. And
Skipper and Laurel settled in. But alas, one night Laurel failed to return from her
foraging among the maples, oaks, and conifers that nestled in the valley; she lay
dead on a nearby road.
The following evening Skipper returned to Lily Pond. All summer he helped
his parents fortify their dam, dredge channels, collect lilies, and frolic with their
newest infants, Huckleberry and Buttercup. But as the leaves turned red and
gold, Skipper once again departed and returned to his abandoned pond.
Meticulously he rebuilt his dilapidated dam. Methodically he shoved mud onto
the shore, then arranged it into pyramids, then sprayed these hillocks with
scented oil from his anal glands and castoreum from his genital opening. These
pungent advertisements, he hoped in beaver ways, would entice a “wife.”
Nature did her work. A few evenings later, naturalist Hope Ryden saw
Skipper in the moonlight. He popped from the rising water—followed by a little
brown female beaver. The two touched noses, then swam about together,
gathering sticks to fill the dike. Like most beavers, Skipper and his tawny
maiden had surreptitiously bonded in the dead of night, then settled into a
lifelong partnership—months before she would come into estrus.
Were they “in love”? In Lily Pond, Ryden writes, “Beaver pairing is based on
an attraction that is as mysterious as it is compelling, one that is unrelated to any
immediate urge to copulate.”
4 Ryden’s remark is important: among beavers,
feelings of attraction and attachment were distinct from those of sex.
One April evening, however, the pair consummated their beaver marriage.
Skipper and his little female emerged from their moonlit pond holding the same
stick between their teeth. They tumbled over and over each other with such gusto
that it looked to Ryden like foreplay. They dove and paddled and chattered
together in dulcet, almost human tones. They were inseparable. And they must
have mated under water—for in early August Skipper’s little companion
produced two fat kits.
Like elephants, these beavers expended tremendous energy as they wooed.
Like elephants, they focussed all of this courtship energy on a “special” other.
Like elephants, Skipper and his tiny mate nuzzled affectionately and played
flirtatiously in tender, dare I say “loving,” ways.
“Mad with Delight”
There are so many descriptions of attraction among animals that it is impossible
to recount them all. I have read about the amorous lives of some hundred
different species, and in every animal society, courting males and females
display traits that are central components of human romantic love.
To begin with, they express wild energy. The American marten and his
female chase each other madly, dodging, hopping, scampering, and swirling with
what looks like glee. Weasels chase so vigorously that naturalists call it “play
fighting.” The male dashes along the ground “making excited trilling calls”
while his mate “may leap playfully around him.”
5
In fact, the female keeps
leaping around her partner long after they have finished copulating and he has
sunk into a slumber. Mating civit cats vigorously chase each other. The male
white-lined bat exuberantly shakes his wings at a female prior to coitus. The
mating badger paws the ground as he purrs loudly. When an estrous female rat
smells a courting male she hops and darts and hops some more, all the while
flicking her ears and glancing over her shoulder in what can only be called a
“come hither” gesture.
Big animals also become energized at mating time. As a female “common”
chimpanzee comes into estrus, males begin to crowd around her. A courting male
“displays” vigorously, rising to his hind legs with penis erect, swaggering before
her on two feet, stamping the ground, rocking from side to side, shaking
branches and staring at his intended. Male and female grizzly bears pace back
and forth at a prescribed distance from one another in perfect synchrony,
swinging their hulking bodies to and fro. Hyenas circle one another as they emit
an excited crackling vocalization known as “laughing.” Mysticete whales rise
from the sea and wave their pectoral fins or flukes so rapidly that it looks as if
they vibrate. Bottlenose dolphins leap out of the water, then plunge and swim
frantically in all directions, often upside down. But perhaps the most enchanting
account of this rapturous energy comes from naturalist Malcolm Penny,
describing the black rhino. The black rhino circles the estrous female, prancing
back and forth on stiff legs, snorting, spraying urine, twirling his tail, shredding
nearby bushes with his horn, tossing foliage in the air, and stepping in place
—“looking,” as Penny put it, “for all the world as if he were dancing.”
6
“Only a mountain has lived long enough to listen objectively to the howl of a
wolf,” it has been said.
7 There is, however, much we can now say objectively
about the wolf. One outstanding trait of this magnificent creature is that, like
human beings, a male and female form a pair-bond to rear their young. And their
courtship is intense. As George Rabb describes this, “The male starts dancing
around the female, lowering his front quarters like a playful dog, and wagging
his tail.”
8
Even amphibians and fish dance energetically as they woo. Diurnal terrestrial
male frogs do a “toe dance,” jumping up and down in front of the female to
display themselves. And Darwin wrote that when a courting male stickleback
fish sees a female he “darts round her in every direction … mad with delight.”
9
Mad with delight: this is certainly true of men and women when they fall in love.
Nervousness
Animal suitors are also nervous and restless. If teenage boys are fidgety on
dates, so are savannah baboons—as primatologist Barb Smuts has demonstrated.
For years, Smuts followed these creatures along their daily routes in the
grasslands of Kenya and she writes a touching description of the courtship
between Thalia and Alexander.
It all began as Thalia, an adolescent, reached the height of estrus. For months
she had avoided Alexander, another adolescent who had joined the baboon troop
only a few months before. But on this early evening Thalia and Alexander sat
about two meters apart on the cliffs where members of the troop often assembled
to sleep. Observes Smuts:
“Alexander was facing west, his sharp muzzle pointing toward the setting
sun, watching the rest of the troop make their way up the cliffs. Thalia was
grooming herself in a perfunctory manner, her attention elsewhere. Every few
seconds she glanced out of the corner of her eye at Alexander without turning
her head. Her glances became longer and longer and her grooming more and
more desultory until she was staring for long moments at Alexander’s profile.
Then, as Alexander shifted and turned his head toward Thalia, she snapped her
head down and peered intently at her own foot. Alexander looked at her, then
away. Thalia stole another glance in his direction, but when he again glanced her
way, she resumed her involvement with her foot.… This charade continued.…
Then without looking at her, Alexander began slowly to edge toward Thalia.…
Thalia froze, and for a second she looked into Alexander’s eyes. Then, as he
began to approach her, she stood, presented her rear to him, and, looking back
over her shoulder, darted nervous glances at him.”
10
Thalia and Alexander were together still at dawn.
Many of Nature’s courters get edgy. Describing a pair of shorebirds,
European avocets, Niko Tinbergen writes, “Both male and female stand and
preen their feathers in a hasty, nervous fashion.
11 Giraffes, among the world’s
most graceful creatures, “walked about restlessly” when they courted.
12 And
naturalist George Schaller depicts the queen of the jungle, saying, “A lioness
fully in heat is restless, changing her position often and sinuously rubbing
herself against the male.”
13
Loss of Appetite
Many animal suitors lose their appetites—yet another characteristic of human
romantic love. When a sexually primed male elephant finds a female in peak
estrus, for example, he dispenses almost entirely with food; he concentrates
solely on copulating and guarding his prize from other males.
14
In fact, a mating
male elephant gradually becomes so thin and tired that he goes out of “musth.”
He must rejoin his bachelor herd where he will recover—eating and resting for
several months.
The courting male northern elephant seal loses almost half his body weight.
As the three-month mating season approaches, males appear along the coast of
California to claim sections of the beach. They fight viciously to stake their
claims; indeed sometimes the shoreline waves are red with blood. Why so much
fuss? Because females soon arrive to bear their pups and then return into estrus
—briefly. The males who own the best pieces of real estate will have sexual
access to the largest harems. So males are unwilling to leave their territory
undefended for even an hour. Food, sleep: these essentials simply lose appeal.
Orangutans also lose their gourmand habits. These orange shambling
relatives of ours live high in the jungle trees of Borneo and Sumatra, some sixty
feet above the ground. When a male has grown the impressive cheek pouches
that advertise his maturity, he begins to mark and defend a large territory full of
fruiting trees. Several females set up smaller home ranges within his acreage.
Each morning he wakes the neighborhood with a salad of grumbles followed by
a bellowing roar to announce his whereabouts and sexual availability. Then
when one of the females comes into estrus he begins to follow her tenaciously
along her leafy trails. The female will only remain fertile for about five days.
And if she conceives during this mating bout, she won’t return into estrus for
more than seven years. So the male must stay near her constantly while she is in
heat, as well as fight off rivals. To make matters worse, male orangs are twice
the size of females; they move far more slowly and eat much more.
Consequently a suitor has to skip meals to keep up with his agile little partner.
These demands of courtship were no problem for Throatpouch, a wild
orangutan living in the Tanjung Putting Reserve, in Borneo. Here primatologist
Birute Galdikas came to study these wild orange beasts in the 1970s. TP, as she
called Throatpouch, was middle-aged, grouchy, irascible, beady-eyed, and huge.
“By orangutan standards, however,” Galdikas writes, “TP probably was a
decidedly handsome fellow.” Galdikas goes on to explain: “The object of TP’s
adoration was Priscilla. When I saw Priscilla with Throatpouch, she was even
dowdier than I remembered. I thought that TP would have chosen a more comely
female. But from the way Throatpouch pursued her, Priscilla had sexual charm
to spare. TP was smitten with her. He couldn’t take his eyes off her. He didn’t
even bother to eat, so enthralled was he by her balding charms.”
15 Even when
Throatpouch did have time to eat, Galdikas reports, he took the gentlemanly
attitude: ladies first.
The courting male lion even gives what little food he can acquire to his
beloved. George Schaller wrote a charming description of this. Apparently a
wooing male noticed a gazelle at a nearby waterhole. So he interrupted his
courtship to fell this prize. Then he carried this luscious gift to the female and sat
nearby to watch as she ate it all, “a touching and striking token considering the
fact that he was hungry.”
16
I suspect the brain chemistry of attraction had overcome this male’s need to
eat.
Persistence
Animals are also tenacious. Most have only a few chances in their lives to
triumph over rivals, court available mates, and breed. So they persevere.
A male giraffe follows a female for hours until she submits to his overtures.
The lioness purrs at the male, rolls suggestively on the ground before him, swats
at him coyly, then flounces off, rejecting his touch. Only patient courters
eventually mount this huge pussycat. The male tiger is equally persistent. He
never takes his eyes off his mate; “even the slightest flicker of her tail receives
his attention.”
17 Perhaps the most amusing looking suitor is the male shrew. He
pursues an estrous female relentlessly, scampering behind her with his nose
pressed over her rump.
18
Darwin even noted this focussed determination among butterflies. “Their
courtship appears to be a prolonged affair,” he wrote, “for I have frequently
watched one or more males pirouetting round a female until I was tired, without
seeing the end of the courtship.”
19
This persistence, seen in so many creatures—from butterflies to rhinos—is a
hallmark of human romantic love.
Affection
Most courting animals also show signs of tenderness, the most charming aspect
of human romance.
Writing of a pair of courting beavers, biologist Lars Wilsson said, “They
sleep curled up close together during the daytime and at night they seek each
other out at regular intervals to groom one another or just simply to sit close side
by side and ‘talk’ for a little while in special contact sounds, the tones and
nuances of which seem to a human expressive of nothing but intimacy and
affection.”
20
The male grizzly bear nuzzles the female’s flanks and snuffles in her ear,
whimpering for acceptance. A male giraffe rubs his head along a female’s neck
and trunk. The tigress nips at her mate, biting him gently on the neck and face as
she rubs her body against his. A mating pair of harbor porpoises swim together,
sometimes over or under one another, but always in tandem as they stroke, rub,
“kiss,” or mouth each other. Chimpanzees hug, pat, and kiss each other’s thighs
and belly. They even kiss with the deep “French kiss,” inserting their tongue
gently into the mouth of a mating partner. Bats stroke each other with their
velvety wing membranes. Even the lowly male cockroach strokes his partner’s
antennae with his own.
Puppy Love
In her groundbreaking book, The Hidden Life of Dogs, Elizabeth Marshall
Thomas maintained that dogs show deep romantic passion for one another. She
arrived at this conclusion moments after she introduced Misha, a handsome
Siberian husky, to her daughter’s young and beautiful dog of the same breed,
Maria. Thomas had agreed to house Misha while his owners were on an
extended trip to Europe.
The day arrived. Misha’s owners delivered this vibrant male to the Thomas
home. Misha pranced into the living room to look about, settling his gaze
immediately on the gorgeous Maria. In an instant he bounded to her feet and
skidded to a stop. At once, Thomas writes, Maria “dropped to her elbows in an
invitation to play. Chase me, her gesture said. And he did. Quickly, lightly, the
two delighted creatures spun around the room. Misha and Maria were so taken
with each other that they noticed nothing. Misha didn’t even notice when his
owners left.”
21
These two joyous dogs were immediately inseparable. Together they ate and
slept and roamed; together they bore four hearty pups; together they reared them
—until the dark day when Misha’s owners gave him away to people in the
countryside. For weeks Maria sat in the window seat of the Thomas home in the
very spot where she had watched her beloved Misha being forced into a car.
Here she pined. Eventually she gave up waiting for him to return. But “Maria
never recovered from her loss,” Thomas writes. “She lost her radiance … and
showed no interest in forming a permanent bond with another male, even
though, over the years, several eligible males joined our household.”
22
Animals Are Choosy
Excessive energy; focussed attention on a particular individual; motivation to
pursue this “special” partner; loss of appetite; persistence; tender stroking,
kissing, licking, snuggling, and coquettish playing: all are striking traits of
human romantic love. Call it what you will, many creatures seem to have an
attraction to one another.
But animals are choosy.
Of all the characteristics of human romantic love that other creatures display,
perhaps none is more revealing than this choosiness. Just as you or I are
unwilling to hop into bed with anyone who winks at us, no other creature on this
planet will expend precious time and energy mating indiscriminately. They
rebuff some; they choose others.
Such is the female African hammerhead bat. During the dry season, males
regularly congregate at a “lekking ground,” a specific mating area along the
forested banks of the Ivindo River in Gabon, Africa. The males arrive at dusk to
set up temporary evening positions. Once settled, they sing with a loud, metallic,
throaty honk as they flap their half-opened wings double-time to their singing
beat. The point: to draw attention to themselves. Soon the females arrive and
cruise among them, hovering to inspect one, then another. As a female examines
a particular male he intensifies his display, flapping wildly as he steps up his
singing to sound a staccato buzz. Amid the cacophony, each female eventually
makes her selection, lands near a particular male, and copulates.
23
Among the “common” chimpanzees that primatologist Jane Goodall has
studied for more than forty years in Tanzania, Flo was the most popular. When
she came into estrus in 1983, Flo was followed everywhere she went by as many
as fourteen adult males, many of whom were even willing to go directly into
Goodall’s campsite to be near this preferred mating partner. Fifi, Flo’s daughter,
was also sought after—much more so than her girlfriend, Pom. Chimps have
favorites.
One is inclined to think these animal attractions are due merely to hormonal
cycling; that the physiology of estrus draws males to choose one female rather
than another. But Goodall, a famed scientist, would not agree. She writes that
“partner preferences, independent of hormonal influences, are clearly of major
significance for chimpanzees.”
24
In fact, she believes that males of many primate
species “show clear-cut preferences for particular females, which may be
independent of cycle stage.”
25 Animal behaviorist Frank Beach made this same
observation in 1976, writing: “The occurrence or non-occurrence of copulation
depends as much on individual affinities and aversions as upon the presence or
absence of sex hormones in the female.”
26
As males prefer certain females regardless of their sexual condition, females
are drawn to particular males despite their lower rank and status, as Darwin
noted over a hundred years ago. He wrote in The Descent of Man that even in
exceedingly aggressive species, females are not necessarily drawn to the
strongest, most courageous, or even the most victorious males at mating time.
Instead, “it is more probable that the females are excited, either before or after
the conflict, by certain males, and thus unconsciously prefer them.”
27
Lions, baboons, wolves, bats, probably even butterflies distinguish between
suitors, assiduously avoiding mating with some and doggedly focussing their
courtship energy on others.
Animals of different species are drawn to different types of partners, of
course. Females of many species (including women) are often attracted to males
of high rank. Some prefer those residing on the best piece of property.
28 Some
want a male who will defend them or help them rear their young instead. Some
like the male with the most symmetrical tail feathers or the reddest face.
Moreover, males are often sensitive to the age of the female, as well as her
health, size, and shape. But as Goodall writes of primates, “personality” is also
highly significant.
29
All animals are choosy. In fact, this favoritism is so common in nature that
the animal literature regularly uses several terms to describe it, including “mate
preference,” “selective proceptivity,” “individual preference,” “favoritism,”
“sexual choice,” and “mate choice.”
Choosy though they are, most animals express their preferences fast.
Love at First Sight
“From the moment she set eyes on him, she adored him. Wanting only to be near
him, to lavish her affection on him, she followed everywhere he went. The sound
of his voice made her bark.”
30 Violet, the panicky little pug who lived with
Elizabeth Marshall Thomas in Cambridge, Massachusetts, was in love with
Bingo, their other pug.
Violet showed all the symptoms of love at first sight.
And her behavior is common in nature—for an important reason: most
female creatures have a breeding season or other specific cyclic period when
they are physiologically ripe. They have only a few minutes, hours, days, or
weeks to breed, conceive, and spread their genes. They cannot afford to spend
months reviewing each suitor’s résumé. Moreover, wooing can be dangerous.
Coitus puts one in a compromising position: predators or competitors can
pounce. Equally important, mating consumes valuable time and energy. So
instant attraction enables males and females of many species to focus their
precious courtship energy on particular individuals and begin the breeding
process swiftly.
Perhaps we humans inherited this phenomenon—because love at first sight is
common to men and women. In a recent survey of one hundred American
couples, 11 percent of these men and women had fallen in love the moment they
set their eyes on their partner; and in a survey of 679 men and women done in
the 1960s, some 30 percent of respondents reported they had fallen in love at an
initial glance.
31
This instant attraction also happened to the American president Thomas
Jefferson. Historian Fawn Brodie writes, “What Jefferson was told in advance
about Maria Cosway is irrelevant, for if ever a man fell in love in a single
afternoon it was he.”
32 A similar experience occurred to a contemporary woman
living in Caruaru, a town in northeast Brazil. To an anthropologist, she confided,
“I had never seen this man. And when we saw each other, I don’t know what it
was that happened, if it was love at first sight or what it was. After one week I
eloped with him.”
33 A woman on the South Seas island of Mangaia expressed the
same feeling. “When I saw this man, I wished that he would be my husband, and
this feeling was a surprise because I had never seen him before.”
34 She married
him. Years later she reflected on the experience, saying the meeting had been
“nature’s work.”
Love at first sight is nature’s work.
Love at First Smell?
People have asked me whether the smell of someone can trigger this instant
attraction. Certainly many animals are immediately attracted to the odors of
particular mating partners. But I doubt that love at first smell happens regularly
to people—for an evolutionary reason.
Our primate ancestors lived high in the trees for at least 30 million years. To
avoid falling to the ground as well as to select ripe fruit, they needed acute vision
—rather than a keen sense of smell. As a result, monkeys and apes have a
comparatively reduced sense of smell and large regions of the brain devoted to
the perception of visual stimuli. We humans inherited these faculties. And these
vision networks are superbly connected to the other senses and to our thoughts
and feelings. In fact, as primates we gather over 80 percent of our knowledge of
the world around us with our eyes. This is undoubtedly why so many Internet
romances end when partners actually meet face-to-face. Visual stimuli are
important to romance.
So I doubt that many humans fall in love when they catch a whiff of a suitor
at a party. But I do think that once a partner becomes familiar—and cherished—
his or her smell can become a kind of aphrodisiac. I have known several women
who liked to sleep in the T-shirt of a sweetheart because they liked its perfume,
for example. And Western literature is full of male characters who are stimulated
by the fragrance of a beloved’s handkerchief or glove.
But no matter what triggers attraction, this magnetism can be instant. When
human beings and other creatures are psychologically and physically ready and a
relatively suitable partner appears before them, the simplest exchange can fire up
attraction.
Then most animals become exceedingly possessive of their prize.
Possessiveness
“Yourself—your soul—in pity give me all / Withhold no atom’s atom or I die.”
Keats wanted to possess every bit of his beloved. Many other creatures share his
sentiment. Some birds and mammals will fight almost until death to possess a
lover exclusively.
During the June mating season, for example, the male grizzly bear attends a
female for several days or even weeks, although he will depart after a while if he
sees other mating opportunities. Observing a veteran male grizzly in
Yellowstone National Park, naturalist Thomas McNamee writes, “In the nest of
leaves and branches that was their day bed, he would lie with a protective and
possessive paw across her shoulder. When other male grizzlies came near … the
merest grunt would usually suffice to send any would-be contender off.”
35
An unhappy example of this possessiveness was observed in mountain
bluebirds by zoologist David Barash.
36 The mating season had begun and a male
and female mountain bluebird had built their nest and settled in. While the male
was off foraging, however, Barash placed a stuffed male mountain bluebird on a
tree limb beside the nest. Bedlam ensued. When the “husband” returned and saw
the intruder, he viciously and repeatedly attacked the dummy. Then he turned on
his mate, brutally attacking her, tearing out two of her primary flight feathers.
She fled. The male soon appeared with a new female with whom he reared a
brood.
While possessiveness drives some creatures to violence, jealousy plunges
others into depression. Remember Violet, the little pug dog who was in love with
Bingo, another pug? Violet doted on her “husband.” They were partners. “Like
two little married people, they had their private arrangements,” writes Elizabeth
Marshall Thomas, even “the way they liked to sleep.” Violet’s troubles started
the day the young and beautiful husky, Maria, came to live in the Marshall
household. Thomas writes of Violet’s jealousy, “What bothered Violet most
about Maria, though, was that Bingo liked her so much. Ignoring Violet, Bingo
spent time every day trying to make a conquest of Maria by parading back and
forth beside her with his ears low, his expression soft and his tail very faintly
wagging. Violet often tried to stop him.” No luck. Eventually Violet “would
withdraw to a distant corner and sit down, chastened and depressed.”
37
Our closest relatives, “common” chimpanzees and bonobos, can also be
highly possessive—even though they are promiscuous by nature. At the height
of estrus, a female often visits one male, then another, sometimes copulating
with over a dozen suitors in a day. Most calmly wait their turn. But some male
chimps become possessive. And as their passion grows, they try to establish an
exclusive partnership with a particular female.
Such was Satan, a chimp living in the Gombe Stream Reserve, Tanzania.
Jane Goodall writes of Satan’s budding liaison with Miff. Miff had just come
into “heat” and all the males knew it. The morning had started noisily as she
passed from one male to the next, presenting her buttocks and coupling with
each. But the day drew on and one by one, the males shuffled off through the
bushes to eat or rest. Satan waited until the last of the other admirers had
departed. Then as Miff roused herself to follow them, Satan jumped in front of
her in the trail and walked casually in a direction not taken by the other males.
He continually looked over his shoulder to see if she was following him. She
was.
After half an hour Miff heard the other males calling through the foliage. For
a moment she looked toward the voices, then directly at Satan, who was shaking
branches impatiently to distract her. She paused, as if weighing her alternatives.
Then she followed Satan over a ridge to a nearby valley—far from all the other
males.
38
Often an estrous female chimp stays in the community to copulate with
almost all the males. If she is attracted to an admirer, however, she may
accompany this “special” individual to the periphery of their home range,
remaining with him from three days to almost three months. Goodall calls these
temporary partnerships “going on safari.”
Mate Guarding
Because possessiveness is so common in nature, animal behaviorists have given
it a name: mate guarding.
39 They regard this taste for sexual exclusivity as a
primary aspect of courtship in many species. Generally it is the male who guards
the female—from poachers, and from defection by the female. For sound
evolutionary reasons. If a male can sequester a female during her ovulation, she
may bear his offspring and pass his genes toward eternity.
Males of species that form pair-bonds to rear their young have a second
Darwinian motivation to be sexually possessive. It is not adaptive for a male to
expend his vital time and energy building a nest, protecting a female, battling
intruders, even feeding young—unless these babies carry his DNA. If his female
cavorts with another male, he risks being cuckolded. So in socially monogamous
species, males tend to be highly sensitive to intruders as they court and “wed.”
Some male monkeys bite a female’s neck if she wanders off or herd her with taps
or shoves; males of many other species fiercely defend a territory where a mate
resides instead.
The men and women who participated in my survey (discussed in chapter
one) also showed this tendency toward mate guarding, particularly the men. Men
were much more likely than women to disagree with the statement: “It is good to
be out of touch with _____ for a few days so that the anticipation can build up
again” (Appendix, #4). This could be because women generally have more
friends, more connections, more family ties, and more responsibilities outside of
their love relationship. But men are probably also unconsciously driven to guard
the vessel that may bear their seed.
They have good reason. In a recent poll of American men and women, 60
percent of men and 53 percent of women admitted to “mate poaching”; they had
tried to woo another’s lover away to make a new committed partnership with
them.
40
In fact, a study of thirty cultures showed how common mate poaching is
around the world.
41 So like mountain bluebirds, humans are possessive.
The human tendency to stalk, even murder a straying lover probably comes
from this animal tendency to guard a mate.
An Immodest Proposal
All these data have led me to believe that animals big and little are biologically
driven to prefer, pursue, and possess specific mating partners: there is chemistry
to animal attraction. And this chemistry must be the precursor of human
romantic love.
But what brain chemicals are involved?
Two closely related natural stimulants in the mammalian brain appear to play
a role: dopamine and norepinephrine. All birds and mammals are endowed with
similar forms of dopamine and norepinephrine, as well as similar structures in
the brain to produce and respond to these natural “uppers”—although these brain
structures and circuits vary from one species to the next.
More important, dopamine and norepinephrine play a crucial role in sexual
arousal and heightened motivation in birds and mammals.
42 For example, female
laboratory rats express their amorous intentions by hopping and darting,
behaviors associated with increased levels of dopamine.
43 And in prairie voles,
little creatures much like field mice, elevated levels of dopamine in the brain are
directly associated with a preference for a particular mating partner.
44
Please meet the prairie vole. These tiny animals live in a maze of tunnels and
burrows on the grasslands of the American Midwest. Voles form pair-bonds to
rear their young. The male leaves home soon after puberty to find a “spouse.”
When he sees a likely candidate, he begins to court her avidly. Sniffing, licking,
nuzzling, mounting: a vole couple copulates over fifty times in roughly two
days. After this sex marathon, the male starts to behave like a new husband,
building a nest for their forthcoming infants, ferociously guarding his mate from
rival males, and defending their mutual home range. Some 90 percent of prairie
voles live in lifelong unison with a single partner.
45
But prairie voles are choosy, as this study showed. Scientists paired an
estrous female prairie vole with a male. As the female copulated with this suitor,
she formed a distinct partiality for him, a favoritism that was accompanied with
a 50 percent increase of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens, a part of the
mammalian brain associated with craving and addiction in people.
46
Equally telling, when scientists injected a specific region of the female
prairie vole’s brain with a substance that reduced levels of dopamine, she no
longer preferred this partner over other males. And when the female was injected
instead with compounds that increased brain levels of dopamine, she began to
prefer the male who was present at the time of infusion—even though she had
never mated with this individual.
47
Dopamine appears to play a key role in animal attraction.
Norepinephrine may contribute to this magnetism. When scientists put a drop
of male urine on the upper lip of a female prairie vole, levels of norepinephrine
elevate in the brain. This contributes to the release of estrogen and stimulates
courting behavior.
48
Is the female prairie vole “attracted” to this scent?
Levels of norepinephrine (and dopamine) also spike as an estrous female
sheep looks at slides of male sheep’s faces.
49 Maybe these ewes are temporarily
infatuated with these rams.
Norepinephrine is even linked with a specific mammalian courting pose:
lordosis—the female habit of crouching, arching her back, and tipping up her
buttocks toward her suitor to advertise sexual availability.
50 Women do this, too.
A woman will look coyly over her shoulder at a man as she gracefully arches her
back and tips her buttocks in his direction.
These data led me to suspect that dopamine and/or norepinephrine play a role
in animal attraction.
More brain chemicals are undoubtedly involved. As elephants, foxes,
squirrels, and many other animals sift through their mating opportunities, they
must distinguish colors, shapes, and sizes, listen for seductive tones, remember
past successes and disasters, and sniff, touch, and taste to gather information
about their potential consorts. A lot of chemical systems undoubtedly coordinate
in some sort of chain reaction to trigger feelings of animal attraction.
But animals love. Tia, Bad Bull, Skipper, Misha, Maria, Violet, Thalia,
Alexander, Miff, Satan, and just about every other mammal and bird on this
planet has probably felt drawn to specific others. Temporarily charmed, these
lovers step to a universal beat, croaking, barking, flapping, trilling, strutting,
staring, nuzzling, patting, copulating—and adoring—their preferred mating
partners.
When the brain chemistry for animal attraction first evolved no one knows. I
suspect that by the time the first primitive mammals were scampering beneath
the feet of dinosaurs, these primordial whiskered brethren of humankind had
evolved a simple brain network to motivate them to distinguish among suitors
and prefer particular ones. With this rudimentary equipment, they went forth to
multiply, spreading this chemistry to myriad swimming, flying, creeping,
hopping, leaping, trotting, swinging beings, including the ancestors of apes and
humans.
Men and women of ancient India called romantic love “the eternal dance of
the universe.”
51 They were right. How long a chipmunk, a zebra, or a whale
actually feels attracted to a special mate obviously varies, however.
Environments vary. Needs vary. And species vary. In rats, attraction probably
lasts only seconds. Elephants appear to be “in love” about three days. Dogs often
show attraction for months and attachment for many years. Some scientists
question how “conscious” these creatures are of their emotions.
52 No one knows.
But animals express heightened energy, focussed attention, euphoria, craving,
persistence, possessiveness, and affection: animal attraction. And data suggest
that this attraction is associated with two common brain chemicals—dopamine
and norepinephrine.
Could these chemicals also play a role in human romantic love? To
understand the chemistry of this “eternal dance,” I decided to look inside the
human brain.

Chemistry of Love: Scanning the Brain “in Love”
For love is as strong as death.
Its passions are as cruel as the grave
And its flashes of fire are the very flame of God.
The Song of Songs (c. 900–300 B.C.E.)
“There is the heat of Love, the pulsing rush of Longing, the lover’s whisper,
irresistible—magic to make the sanest man go mad.”
1 This magic that Homer
sang of in The Iliad has started wars, sired dynasties, toppled kingdoms, and
generated some of the world’s finest literature and art. People sing for love, work
for love, kill for love, live for love, and die for love. What causes this sorcery?
As you know, I have come to believe that romantic love is a universal human
feeling, produced by specific chemicals and networks in the brain. But exactly
which ones? Determined to shed some light on this magic that can make the
sanest man go mad, I launched a multipart project in 1996 to collect scientific
data on the chemistry and brain circuitry of romantic love. I assumed that many
chemicals must be involved in one way or another. But I focussed my
investigation on dopamine and norepinephrine, as well as a related brain
substance, serotonin.
I looked into the nature of these chemicals for two reasons: the attraction
animals feel for particular mates is linked with elevated levels of dopamine
and/or norepinephrine in the brain. More important, all three of these chemicals
produce many of the sensations of human romantic passion.
Rock On, Sweet Dopamine
Take dopamine. Elevated levels of dopamine in the brain produce extremely
focussed attention,
2 as well as unwavering motivation and goal-directed
behaviors.
3 These are central characteristics of romantic love. Lovers intensely
focus on the beloved, often to the exclusion of all around them. Indeed, they
concentrate so relentlessly on the positive qualities of the adored one that they
easily overlook his or her negative traits;
4
they even dote on specific events and
objects shared with this sweetheart.
Besotted lovers also regard the beloved as novel and unique. And dopamine
has been associated with learning about novel stimuli.
5
Central to romantic love is the lover’s preference for the beloved. As you
recall from chapter two, among prairie voles, this favoritism is associated with
heightened levels of dopamine in specific brain regions. And it is not a leap of
logic to suggest that if dopamine is associated with mate preference in prairie
voles, it can play a role in partiality in people. As you recall, all mammals have
basically the same brain machinery, although size, shape, and placement of brain
parts definitely vary.
6
Ecstasy is another outstanding trait of lovers. This, too, appears to be
associated with dopamine. Elevated concentrations of dopamine in the brain
produce exhilaration, as well as many of the other feelings that lovers report—
including increased energy, hyperactivity, sleeplessness, loss of appetite,
trembling, a pounding heart, accelerated breathing, and sometimes mania,
anxiety, or fear.
7
Dopamine involvement may even explain why love-stricken men and women
become so dependent on their romantic relationship and why they crave
emotional union with their beloved. Dependency and craving are symptoms of
addiction—and all of the major addictions are associated with elevated levels of
dopamine.
8
Is romantic love an addiction? Yes; I think it is—a blissful
dependency when one’s love is returned, a painful, sorrowful, and often
destructive craving when one’s love is spurned.
In fact, dopamine may fuel the frantic effort a lover musters when he/she
feels the love affair is in jeopardy. When a reward is delayed, dopamineproducing cells in the brain increase their work, pumping out more of this
natural stimulant to energize the brain, focus attention, and drive the pursuer to
strive even harder to acquire a reward: in this case, winning one’s sweetheart.
9
Dopamine, thy name is persistence.
Even the craving for sex with the beloved may be indirectly related to
elevated levels of dopamine. As dopamine increases in the brain, it often drives
up levels of testosterone, the hormone of sexual desire.
Norepinephrine’s High
Norepinephrine, a chemical derived from dopamine, may also contribute to the
lover’s high. The effects of norepinephrine are varied, depending on the part of
the brain it activates. Nevertheless, increasing levels of this stimulant generally
produce exhilaration, excessive energy, sleeplessness, and loss of appetite—
some of the basic characteristics of romantic love.
Increasing levels of norepinephrine could also help explain why the lover can
remember the smallest details of the beloved’s actions and cherished moments
spent together. This liquor is associated with increased memory for new
stimuli.
10
A third chemical may also be involved in that “irresistible” feeling of magic
Homer spoke of: serotonin.
Serotonin
A striking symptom of romantic love is incessant thinking about the beloved.
Lovers cannot turn off their racing thoughts. Indeed, this single aspect of being
in love is so intense that I use it as the litmus test of romantic passion. The first
thing I ask anyone who tells me they are “in love” is, “What percentage of your
waking hours do you think about your sweetheart?” Many say “over 90 percent.”
Some bashfully admit they never stop thinking about “him” or “her.”
Lovers are obsessed. And doctors who treat individuals with most forms of
obsessive-compulsive disorder prescribe SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors) such as Prozac or Zoloft, substances that elevate levels of serotonin in
the brain.
11 So I came to suspect that the lover’s persistent, involuntary,
irresistible ruminations about a sweetheart might be associated with low levels of
some type (there are at least fourteen variations) of this chemical compound.
12
There is some support for my reasoning. In 1999, scientists in Italy studied
sixty individuals: twenty were men and women who had fallen in love in the
previous six months; twenty others suffered from unmedicated obsessivecompulsive disorder (OCD); twenty more were normal, healthy individuals who
were not in love and were used as controls. Both the in-love participants and
those suffering from OCD were found to have significantly lower levels of
serotonin than did the controls.
13
These scientists examined serotonin levels in components of the blood,
however, rather than the brain. Until scientists document the activity of serotonin
in specific brain regions, we cannot be sure of the role of serotonin in romantic
love. Nevertheless, this experiment has established, for the first time, a possible
connection between romantic love and low levels of bodily serotonin.
All those countless hours when your mind races like a mouse upon a
treadmill may be associated with reduced levels of serotonin coursing through
the highways of the brain.
And as a love affair intensifies, this irresistible, obsessive thinking can
increase—due to a negative relationship between serotonin and its relatives,
dopamine and norepinephrine. As levels of dopamine and norepinephrine climb,
they can cause serotonin levels to plummet.
14 This could explain why a lover’s
increasing romantic ecstasy actually intensifies the compulsion to daydream,
fantasize, muse, ponder, obsess about a romantic partner.
A “Working” Hypothesis
Given the properties of these three related chemicals in the brain—dopamine,
norepinephrine, and serotonin—I began to suspect that all played a role in
human romantic passion.
The feelings of euphoria, sleeplessness, and loss of appetite, as well as the
lover’s intense energy, focussed attention, driving motivation, and goal-oriented
behaviors, his/her tendency to regard the beloved as novel and unique, and the
lover’s increased passion in the face of adversity might all be caused, in part, by
heightened levels of dopamine and/or norepinephrine in the brain. And the
lover’s obsessive cogitation about the beloved might be due to decreased brain
levels of some type of serotonin.
Now for the caveats. This theory is complicated by many facts: different
doses of these chemicals can produce different effects. These substances do
different things in different brain parts. Each interacts with the others in different
ways under different circumstances. And each harmonizes with many other
bodily systems and brain circuits, setting up complex chain reactions. Moreover,
passionate romantic love takes a variety of graded forms, from pure elation when
one’s love is reciprocated to feelings of emptiness, despair, and often rage when
one’s love is thwarted. These chemicals undoubtedly vary in their concentrations
and combinations as the relationship ebbs and flows.
Nevertheless, the distinct correlation between numerous characteristics of
romantic love and the effects of these three brain substances led me to the
following hypothesis: this fire in the mind is caused by elevated levels of either
dopamine or norepinephrine or both, as well as decreased levels of serotonin.
These chemicals form the backbone of obsessive, passionate, romantic love.
Scanning the Brain in Love
Next, I needed to find the regions of the brain involved in Homer’s “pulsing rush
of Longing.” I knew that dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin were much
more prevalent in some brain regions than in others. If I could establish which
regions of the brain become active while one is feeling romantic rapture, that
might confirm which primary chemicals were involved. It was time to embark
on the project to scan the brains of love-struck men and women.
With neuroscientist Greg Simpson, then at the Albert Einstein College of
Medicine, I developed a scheme. We would collect data on brain activity while
love-smitten subjects performed two separate tasks: looking at a photograph of
his or her beloved, and looking at a “neutral” photograph of an acquaintance
who generated no positive or negative romantic feelings. Moreover, we would
use a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) machine to take pictures of
the brain.
The fMRI machine records blood flow in the brain. It is based, in part, on a
simple principle: brain cells that are active suck up more blood than quiescent
brain parts—in order to collect the oxygen they need to do their job. Using this
machine I would not need to inject my subjects with colored dye or intrude on
their bodies in any other way. No pain. That appealed to me. Then to analyze our
data, we would compare the brain activity that occurred while our subjects gazed
at a photo of their sweetheart with their brain activity as they looked at the
neutral image.
A good beginning, we thought. In 1996 we scanned four subjects, two young
men and two young women. All were madly in love. The results were
encouraging. But my colleague had to withdraw from the experiment due to
other professional commitments. Fortunately I had already invited Lucy Brown,
an accomplished neuroscientist at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, to
interpret the scanning results—a technologically sophisticated, time-gobbling,
and intellectually demanding task. With time we were joined by Art Aron, a
talented research psychologist at the State University of New York in Stony
Brook, and the gifted Deb Mashek, then a graduate student in the SUNY Stony
Brook psychology department.
I had one concern about the design of the experiment. As you recall, lovers
have a hard time not thinking about their beloved. I was afraid that the lover’s
passionate romantic thoughts, generated as he/she looked at the photo of a
sweetheart, would carry over and contaminate their passive thoughts as they
looked at the neutral photo. When I discussed this with Art and Deb, Art
recommended a “distraction task,” a standard psychological procedure used to
wash the brain clean of emotion. We settled on a particular “distraction task” that
amuses me to this day.
Between looking at the positive photo of the sweetheart and the neutral photo
of some boring acquaintance, subjects would be shown a large number (like
8,421) on the screen and be required to mentally count backward from this
number in increments of seven. The point: to cleanse the mind of strong feelings
between exposure to the beloved and exposure to the neutral stimulus. Try it the
next time you are upset, very upset. Pick any large number; then really
concentrate on counting backward in increments of seven starting with that
number. It’s demanding. But it works. At least briefly, feelings simply fade away
as you struggle to count accurately.
Before we started to scan more brains of love-stricken men and women,
however, we had to be certain of one thing: that a photograph of the beloved
would actually stimulate feelings of romantic love more effectively than would a
smell, song, love letter, memory, or other object or phenomenon associated with
the beloved.
Poets and artists have always known the power of visual images, of course.
As William Butler Yeats wrote, “Wine comes in at the mouth / and love comes in
at the eye.”
15 Most psychologists also assume that the visual image triggers
romantic passion. We were convinced of this ourselves. But before we attempted
to generate feelings of romantic ecstasy with a photograph, Art, Deb, and I
wanted to be positive that love “comes in at the eye” more intensely than
through some other sense.
To find out, we launched an ingenious experiment with a device we came to
call the love-o-meter.
The Love-o-meter
On a bulletin board for psychology students on the SUNY Stony Brook campus,
Art and Deb solicited men and women who were in love. The announcement
began with bold letters: “Have you just fallen madly in love?” “Just” and
“madly” were the operative words. We sought only candidates who were so
intensely in love that they could hardly eat or sleep.
Lots of volunteers contacted Deb at the Stony Brook psychology department,
then arrived in person. She selected those who seemed genuinely in love, and
gave each several questionnaires designed to provide insights into their
personality, their feelings about the beloved, and the duration, intensity, and
status of their love affair. Then she asked each to return to the lab a week later,
bearing items that made them feel intense romantic passion for their adored one.
Back these students came with photographs, letters, e-mails, birthday cards,
music tapes, colognes, memories written on sheets of paper, and notes about
anticipated future events. They carried them like glass flowers.
Then each subject was prepared for the experiment. First Deb glued three
electrodes to different regions of the scalp, thereby connecting the participant to
an electroencephalograph (EEG). She told each subject that these wires would
record their brain waves during the experiment. Actually, this wasn’t true; the
machine was not turned on. But we hoped this deception would stimulate each
volunteer to be honest. Then, the participant sat in front of a computer screen
displaying an icon that looked like a vertically standing thermometer and was
given a handheld rotating dial, arching from zero to thirty degrees. By turning
this spring-loaded dial, the subject could raise the “mercury” in the thermometer.
When he/she released the dial, it returned to zero. We jokingly called this
computer-based response device our love-o-meter.
The experiment began. First the subject was shown the photograph of his/her
beloved, then a neutral photo of someone else of the same sex or a photograph of
nature. Second, each participant read a love letter from the beloved, then a
paragraph from a statistics book. Third, each smelled a scent that reminded them
of the beloved, then water with weak rubbing alcohol. Fourth, the subject was
asked to “think back” to a wonderful moment with the sweetheart, then recall
some mundane event such as the last time they washed their hair. Fifth, each
heard a song they associated with their sweetheart, then a song sung by
characters on the American children’s television show Sesame Street. Last, each
participant was asked to imagine an exhilarating future event with the beloved,
then a mundane incident such as brushing teeth. And each assignment was
interspersed with our distraction task: mentally counting backward in increments
of seven, starting with one from a sequence of large numbers.
The subject’s job was to respond to each task by twisting the love-o-meter
dial to reflect the intensity of his/her feelings of romantic passion. Eleven
women and three men participated; their average age was eighteen and a half.
When their responses were recorded and statistically analyzed, the results were
revealing: feelings of intense romantic love were triggered almost equally by
photographs, songs, and memories of the beloved.
16
Photographs Stimulate Love
I was not surprised that photographs elicit romantic passion. After all, most of us
keep a picture of our true love on our desk. Moreover, as you recall, this visceral
reaction to visual images has an anthropological explanation. Humans evolved
from tree-living ancestors who needed exceptional vision to survive high above
the ground. Those with bad eyesight must have misjudged where fruit and
blossoms hung, then missed their mark as they leapt from one branch to another
and fell and broke their necks. As a result, all higher primates have large brain
regions devoted to the perception and integration of visual stimuli. In fact, for
decades psychologists have emphasized the important role of visual appearances
in stimulating feelings of romantic attraction.
17
This experiment confirmed for us that photographs of the beloved actually do
elicit romantic bliss. Our experimental design was sound. We could begin to put
lovers into the brain scanner and search for the circuitry of romantic ecstasy.
The Experiment
“Have you just fallen madly in love?” We used this line again when we placed a
new advertisement on the psychology bulletin board on the SUNY Stony Brook
campus. But this time we called for men and women who were willing to recline
in a long, dark, cramped, noisy machine while we scanned their brains. Once
again, we sought only those who had fallen crazily in love within the last few
weeks or months, people whose romantic feelings were fresh, vivid,
uncontrollable, and passionate.
They were not difficult to find. In John Donne’s words, “Love, all alike, no
season knows, nor clime, / Nor hours, days, months, which are the rags of
time.”
18 Love springs up everywhere, at any time. Students immediately began to
call Art’s psychology lab to volunteer. Deb weeded out those who had metal in
their heads (such as lip, tongue, nose, or face jewelry, or braces on their teeth)
that would affect the magnet in the fMRI machine. She also excluded those who
were claustrophobic, those taking any kind of antidepressant medication that
could affect brain physiology, and men and women who were left-handed. Brain
organization can vary with “handedness” and we needed to standardize our
sample as much as possible.
At this point, I interviewed each candidate, sometimes for as long as two
hours. My first question was always the same: “How long have you been in
love?” My second question was the most important: “What percentage of the day
and night do you think about your sweetheart?” Because obsessive thinking is a
central ingredient of romantic passion, I sought only participants who thought
about their beloved almost all of their waking hours. I also looked for men and
women who laughed and sighed more than usual during the interview, those who
could recall tiny details about their sweethearts, and those who honestly
appeared to be yearning for, indeed craving, their beloved.
If a potential subject showed these and other signs of romantic passion, I
invited him or her to participate. We acquired two photographs from the subject:
one of the beloved and one of an emotionally neutral individual. Generally the
latter was someone they had known casually in high school or college. Then we
set a date to put each into the brain scanner.
The Brain Scanning Procedure
Not, of course, without a great deal of discussion about what would happen to
them while in the fMRI brain scanning machine. I started by telling each
participant that I had gone through the experiment myself three times, which I
had. I explained that I was somewhat claustrophobic but felt I needed to
experience this process before I ushered others through it. I described what
would happen in the machine, minute by minute. And I assured each of them
there would be no surprises. I needed these men and women to trust me; without
this trust, we might end up measuring feelings of suspicion or panic rather than
romantic love.
When all seemed ready, we set a time for the scanning. What joy, what
anxiety, what curiosity I felt as we made that date.
The procedure was simple, but not easy. First Deb and I made the participant
as comfortable as possible in the scanner—a large, horizontal, cylindrical,
cream-colored plastic tube that is open at both ends and extends from above the
head to about the waist. The subject reclined on a stretcher in this tubular
machine in the semidark with one to two feet of space above and alongside
them, depending on their size. We put pillows under their knees to relax the
back, warmed them with a blanket, nestled their head in a stiff pillow to help
them remain motionless during the experiment, and suspended a slanted mirror
over their eyes. This way the subject could look out of the scanner to see a
screen on which we would show successively each photo, as well as the large
number—the distraction task.
After taking preliminary scans to establish basic brain anatomy, the twelveminute experiment started. First, the subject looked at the photograph of the
beloved on the screen for thirty seconds as the scanner recorded blood flow in
various brain regions.
Next, the subject viewed a large number, such as 4,673. These numbers
changed with each new viewing but each was the same distraction task. For forty
seconds the subject was required to mentally count backward from this number
in increments of seven.
The participant then looked at the neutral photograph for thirty seconds while
the brain was scanned again.
Finally, the subject viewed another large number, this time for twenty
seconds, and mentally counted backward from this number in increments of
seven.
This cycle (or its reverse) was repeated six times—enabling us to collect
some one hundred forty-four scans or pictures of different brain regions across
these four conditions for each participant. After the experiment was over, I
interviewed each subject again, asking how they felt and what they were
thinking about during all parts of the test. And to express our gratitude, we gave
each participant $50.00 and a picture of their brain.
We scanned twenty men and women who were deeply and happily in love.
Then we scanned twenty more, of a different type—individuals who had recently
been jilted, those suffering from rejection in romance. By studying romantic
rejection, a devastating aspect of love that happens to just about everybody at
one time or another,
19 we hoped to identify the full range of brain regions
associated with romantic passion. (My discussion of unrequited love appears in
chapter seven.)
The Passionate Love Scale
There was one more part to this experiment. Before our subjects entered the
brain scanner, we asked each to fill out several questionnaires, including the one
my other colleagues and I had given to 839 Americans and Japanese and a
similar survey designed by psychologists Elaine Hatfield and Susan Sprecher
called the Passionate Love Scale.
20
The Passionate Love Scale had fifteen questions about romantic love. Most
were very similar to those on my questionnaire. Among them were: “I would
feel deep despair if ___ left me.” And “Sometimes I feel I can’t control my
thoughts; they are obsessively on ___.” The subject was asked to respond to each
statement, noting his/her reaction on a nine-point scale from “not at all true” to
“definitely true.”
We wanted to compare the brain activity of each subject to what each subject
reported on these questionnaires, to see if those who scored high on these love
surveys also had more activity in the brain. This way we hoped to answer a
question that survey-makers have long puzzled over: Does what a person reports
on a questionnaire accurately reflect what is going on in their brain?
We didn’t know it at the time, but the Passionate Love Scale would prove
remarkably informative about the brain in love.
Happily in Love
I remember distinctly all of the men and women who were scanned, each for
some special reason.*
One was Bjorn, a young man from a Scandinavian country who was studying
in New York. He was in love with Isabel, a woman originally from Brazil who
was currently working in London. They talked every day on the phone, he told
me, and saw each other on vacations. They had been “dating” for a little less
than a year and planned to marry. I mention Bjorn because I learned something
valuable from him. This was a blond, bushy-haired, self-contained man with a
warm smile, a quiet charm, a sharp intelligence, and a flashing sense of humor. I
liked him immediately. But when I first asked him to describe his beloved, he
fell silent, utterly mute. For a moment I thought I had lost the phone connection.
I recall rather frantically saying to him, “Well, you must like something about
Isabel.” His reply: “Yawwww.”
I had to cajole Bjorn into saying anything whatsoever about his beloved!
Eventually he shyly revealed that he daydreamed about Isabel constantly, loved
her passionately, and thought about her as much as 95 percent of the day and
evening. But Bjorn never expressed that urgent excitement so characteristic of
the love-possessed. So I was later astonished when I saw the results of his brain
scanning session. When this reserved young man looked at the picture of his
sweetheart, his brain “lit up” like a fireworks display. Do still waters run deep?
Bjorn rattled me. His dour countenance masked his inner passion. I didn’t
think he was consciously trying to deceive me. Instead, he expressed himself in a
way that was molded by his biology, his upbringing, and his culture. Yet his
outward expressions did not reflect his inner world. This raised a serious
question in my mind: How was I to choose appropriate candidates?
I thought about this a lot. Finally, I got a penetrating glimpse of the obvious:
I had no choice. I simply had to ask potential participants as many questions as
possible, listen carefully to their words, and note any physical signs of elation,
energy, focussed attention, possessiveness, and obsessive thinking. And I had to
pray that my social skills were good enough to pick people who were genuinely
in love.
Our most dramatic subject was Barbara, a tall, fair, red-headed, handsome,
and extremely verbal woman in her early twenties. She had met Michael on the
beach in New Jersey five months earlier. She was so in love that she was having
trouble sleeping. Her mind raced. She felt shy in his company. At times her heart
pounded when they spoke on the phone. She obsessively replayed in her mind
their times together. She spoke of the “electricity” she felt. She reported that she
would “go crazy” when he didn’t call. She was wildly jealous, too. Apparently
he had lots of women friends and she didn’t even like him to talk with one on the
phone. When I asked her if she would consider having a second romantic
relationship “on the side,” she was dumbfounded. Characteristic of almost all
lovers, Barbara couldn’t conceive of spending time with anyone but Michael.
And when I asked her what she liked most about him, she replied, “Chemistry.”
It was the first time Barbara had been in love. She glowed.
The most arresting response of our happy lovers was that of William.
William was quick to understand, intensely smart, amiable, eager to participate,
curious about the machine, and interested in my theories about romantic love.
We talked easily together before the experiment. But he missed his girlfriend
terribly. She had moved to Oregon. And although they were very much in love
and in frequent contact, he was suffering from her absence. This was a good
sign; I suspected that this adversity had increased his passion. But it was
something William said during the post-scanning interview that impressed me
most. When he emerged from the machine, I asked him how he felt. William
said he felt “incomplete.”
Incomplete. To me, no single word better describes love-smitten men and
women. Although Aristophanes was joking, he hit upon this fundamental truth
about lovers some twenty-five hundred years ago. In Plato’s Symposium, the
Athenian dramatist maintained that originally every human being was a rounded
hermaphroditic whole, with four hands and four legs, two faces on one head,
four ears, and both sets of genitals. These primal human beings “were terrible in
their strength and vigour.”
21 One day these monsters tried to outdo the gods. So
Zeus sliced each human into two—man and woman. “That’s how, long ago, the
innate desire of human beings for each other started,” Aristophanes explained.
“Each one of us is looking for his own matching half.”
22 Like William, most
lovers feel incomplete until they have achieved emotional union with a beloved.
Bjorn, Barbara, William, and all of our other participants told me a great deal
about their personal lives; to all of them I am very grateful. But their brains told
us much more about this primordial passion, romantic love.
The Brain in Love
“In the composition of the human frame there is a great deal of inflammable
matter, however dormant it may lie for a time, and … when the torch is put to it,
that which is within you must burst into a blaze.”
23
In 1795, President George
Washington wrote these lines of advice in a letter to his young stepgranddaughter. We have begun to understand that blaze.
Before we could comprehend the results of our scanning, however, we had to
make an in-depth analysis of the brain pictures. Here my colleagues did a
yeoman’s job. There were literally hundreds of intricate steps in this process.
And because the technology of brain scanning is so new and so complex, things
constantly went wrong—and the analysis had to be redone. But with time, Greg
Strong, another talented psychology graduate student at SUNY Stony Brook who
had joined our team, was able to put the data in the proper order; Lucy studied
the brain scans and determined which areas became active; Art did many
statistical analyses. And Art and Lucy did ingenious comparisons between
various sectors of the material. All this took enormous time, dedication,
knowledge, creativity, insight, and skill.
Finally we saw the results: beautiful pictures of the brain in love. When I
first looked at those brain scans, with the active brain regions lit up in bright
yellow and deep orange, I felt the way I feel on a summer night when I gaze at
the sparkling universe: overwhelming awe. But to understand what I saw, you
must know a little bit about the furniture in your head.
The brain is composed of many parts or regions. Each has particular
functions. And each communicates with other brain regions via nerve cells or
neurons—some 10 billion of them. These nerve cells produce, store, and
distribute neurotransmitters of different types; some, for example, synthesize
dopamine, norepinephrine, and/or serotonin. When a neuron is electrically
stimulated by a nearby neuron, the impulse often prompts these
neurotransmitters to exit from a nerve cell, sail across a tiny gap, or synapse, and
dock at “receptor sites” on the next nerve cell. This way neurotransmitters send
an electrical impulse along, cell by cell.
Each nerve cell has about one thousand of these synaptic connections; and
there are some 10 trillion synapses between nerve cells in the human brain.
Some machine! Each nerve cell communicates only with specific others,
however, producing nerve networks that connect specific brain parts and
integrate our thoughts, memories, sensations, emotions, and motivations.
Scientists call these networks of nerves and brain parts “circuits,” “systems,” or
“modules.”
The fMRI machine that we were using only shows blood flow activity in
specific brain regions. But because scientists know which kinds of nerves
connect which kinds of brain regions, they can surmise which brain chemicals
are active when specific brain regions begin to glow with increased activity.
Many brain parts became active in each of our love-struck subjects.
24
However, two regions appear to be central to the exquisite experience of being in
love.
The Reward System of the Brain
Perhaps our most important finding was activity in the caudate nucleus. This is a
large C-shaped region that sits deep near the center of your brain (see diagram
here). It is primitive; it is part of what is called the reptilian brain or R-complex
because this brain region evolved long before the mammals proliferated some 65
million years ago. Our brain scans showed that parts of the body and the tail of
the caudate became particularly active as a lover gazed at the photo of a
sweetheart.
25
I was astonished. Scientists have long known that this brain region directs
bodily movement. Only recently have they come to realize that this enormous
engine is part of the brain’s “reward system,” the mind’s network for general
arousal, sensations of pleasure, and the motivation to acquire rewards.
26 The
caudate helps us detect and perceive a reward, discriminate between rewards,
prefer a particular reward, anticipate a reward, and expect a reward. It produces
motivation to acquire a reward and plans specific movements to obtain a reward.
The caudate is also associated with the acts of paying attention and learning.
27
Not only did our subjects exhibit activity in the caudate, but the more
passionate they were, the more active their caudate was.
We discovered this in a curious way. Remember the Passionate Love Scale
that our subjects filled out before entering the brain scanning machine? When we
compared each subject’s responses on this questionnaire with the activity shown
in their brains, we found a positive correlation: those who scored higher on the
Passionate Love Scale also showed more activity in a specific region of the
caudate when they looked at the picture of their sweetheart.
How remarkable. Scientists and businesspeople have long wondered whether
self-report questionnaires actually reflect one’s inner feelings. In this case, the
answer was yes. Our team would be among the first to show a direct link
between responses to a survey questionnaire and a specific pattern of brain
activation.
We also found activity in other regions of the reward system, including areas
of the septum and a brain region that becomes active when people eat
chocolate.
28 Chocolate can be addictive. In chapter eight I will maintain that
romantic love is addictive, too.
The Dopamine Mother Lode
Another striking result from our fMRI experiment was activity in the ventral
tegmental area (VTA), a central part of the reward circuitry of the brain.
29
This result was what I was looking for. I had hypothesized, as you know, that
romantic love is associated with elevated levels of dopamine and/or
norepinephrine.
30 The VTA is a mother lode for dopamine-making cells. With
their tentacle-like axons, these nerve cells distribute dopamine to many brain
regions, including the caudate nucleus (see diagram).
31 And as this sprinkler
system sends dopamine to many brain parts, it produces focussed attention,
32 as
well as fierce energy, concentrated motivation to attain a reward, and feelings of
elation, even mania
33—the core feelings of romantic love.
No wonder lovers talk all night or walk till dawn, write extravagant poetry
and self-revealing e-mails, cross continents or oceans to hug for just a weekend,
change jobs or lifestyles, even die for one another. Drenched in chemicals that
bestow focus, stamina, and vigor, and driven by the motivating engine of the
brain, lovers succumb to a Herculean courting urge.
That “inflammable matter” that Founding Father George Washington spoke
of is, at least in part, dopamine churning up the caudate nucleus and other parts
of the brain’s reward system—a primordial brain network that drives the lover to
focus his or her attention on life’s grandest prize—a mate who may pass their
DNA toward eternity.
How Love Changes
During our experiment we also discovered one way in which love changes over
time. Our insight was due to a remarkable coincidence. In 2000, while we were
in the middle of our project, scientists at University College, London, announced
the completion of a similar experiment.
34 Using an fMRI brain scanner, Andreas
Bartels and Semir Zeki examined brain activity in seventeen subjects who
reported being “deeply, truly and madly in love.” Eleven were women; all were
between the ages of twenty-one and thirty-seven; and all looked at a photograph
of their beloved, as well as photos of three friends of similar age, sex, and length
of friendship.
The London experiment was a distinct achievement. Bartels and Zeki found
several brain regions that become active while subjects gaze at pictures of a
sweetheart. Particularly important, they found activity in one of the same regions
of the caudate nucleus. What joy. Two research teams on different continents,
with different subjects from different ethnic groups and of different general ages,
in somewhat different experiments, found activity in the same brain structure.
The caudate nucleus—with its supercharge of dopamine—must be the furnace of
human romantic love.
However, the London data also told us something about how love develops
across time. We hadn’t planned to investigate how love changes. But the London
study subjects were in love for an average duration of 2.3 years while ours were
in love a mean duration of seven months. And their men and women showed
activity in two regions—the anterior cingulate cortex and the insular cortex—
whereas ours showed none (see diagram here). These differences provoked us to
compare the subjects in our study with one another.
Sure enough, our subjects who were in longer relationships showed activity
in the anterior cingulate cortex and the insular cortex, just like the London study.
We don’t know what this actually means. The anterior cingulate gyrus is a
region where emotions, attention, and working memory interact.
35 Some parts
are associated with happy states; others involve awareness of one’s own
emotional state and the ability to assess other people’s feelings during social
interactions; and some are associated with split-second emotional reactions to a
win or loss, thereby judging a reward’s value.
36 The insular cortex collects data
from the body regarding external touch and temperature, as well as internal pain
and activities of the stomach, gut, and other viscera. With this brain part we
register “butterflies” in the stomach, a pounding heart, and our many other
bodily reactions. Parts of the insular cortex also process the emotions.
So we established that as a relationship lengthens, brain regions associated
with emotions, memory, and attention begin to respond in new ways. Exactly
what these brain parts are doing, no one knows. Is the brain laying down and
consolidating emotional memories of the love relationship?
37 Are we using our
emotions to analyze the relationship? We all know love changes over time; when
we come to understand these results, they may tell us how and why.
Our New York team also found several gender differences in romantic
passion. But I will discuss these findings and their implications in chapter five.
The Drive to Love
All these data had a definite effect on me—they changed my understanding of
romantic love. For many years I had regarded this wonderful experience as a
constellation of related emotions that ranged from elation to despair. But
psychologists distinguish between emotions and motivations—brain systems
oriented around planning and pursuit of a specific want or need. And our
colleague, Art Aron, was wedded to the idea that romantic love was not an
emotion but a motivation system designed to enable suitors to build and maintain
an intimate relationship with a preferred mating partner.
38
Indeed, because of Art’s dedication to this idea, we had begun our brain
scanning project with two hypotheses: my hypothesis that romantic love is
associated with dopamine and/or other closely related neurotransmitters in the
brain; and Art’s theory that romantic love is primarily a motivation system,
rather than an emotion.
As it turns out, our results suggest that both hypotheses are correct. Romantic
love does seem to be associated with dopamine. And because this passion
emanates from the caudate nucleus, motivation and goal-oriented behaviors are
involved.
In fact, these findings prompted me to come to an even broader
consideration: I came to believe that romantic love is a primary motivation
system in the brain—in short, a fundamental human mating drive.
Neuroscientist Don Pfaff defines a drive as a neural state that energizes and
directs behavior to acquire a particular biological need to survive or reproduce.
39
We have lots of drives. They lie along a continuum. Some, like thirst and the
need for warmth, cannot be extinguished until satisfied. The sex drive, hunger,
and the maternal instinct, on the other hand, can often be redirected, even
quelled with time and effort. I think the experience of falling in love lies
somewhere along this continuum.
First of all, like drives, romantic attraction is tenacious; it is very hard to
extinguish. Emotions, on the other hand, come and go; you can be happy in the
morning and angry in the afternoon.
Like drives, romantic love is focussed on a specific reward, the beloved, in
the same way that hunger is focussed on food. Emotions, like disgust, pin
themselves to an immense variety of objects and ideas. In fact, romantic love is
linked with many diverse emotions depending on whether this urge is being
satisfied or frustrated.
Like drives, romantic love is not associated with any particular facial
expression. All of the primary emotions—among them anger, fear, joy, surprise,
and disgust—have stereotypic facial looks.
Like drives, romantic love is exceedingly difficult to control. It is harder to
curb thirst, for example, than it is to control an emotion, such as anger.
Very important, all of the basic drives are associated with elevated levels of
central dopamine.
40 So is romantic love.
And like all the other drives, romantic love is a need, a craving. We need
food. We need water. We need warmth. And the lover feels he/she needs the
beloved. Plato had it right over two thousand years ago. The god of love “lives
in a state of need.”
41
Love’s Complex Chemistry
Undoubtedly many other brain systems contribute to this “pulsing rush of
Longing,” as Homer called it. As you remember, I initially hypothesized that
norepinephrine might be involved because it is so closely related to dopamine
and produces so many of the same feelings and behaviors. I still suspect
norepinephrine contributes to the passion of romance; we just haven’t yet
devised the appropriate experiment to establish this.
Low levels of serotonin produce obsessive thinking—a central component of
romantic love. So I think someday we may find that this chemical contributes to
romantic ardor, too.
42
The prefrontal cortex must be involved. This assemblage of brain regions
that lie behind the forehead is called the “central executive” because it collects
data from our senses, weighs them, integrates thoughts with feelings, makes
choices, and controls our basic drives (see diagram here). It is here that we
reason, deliberate, and decide. With various regions of the prefrontal cortex we
also monitor rewards. And several parts have direct connections to the caudate
nucleus.
43 Someday someone will identify those regions of the prefrontal cortex
that help to orchestrate romantic love.
But we are coming to some understanding of the drive to love.
And what an elegant design. This passion emanates from the motor of the
mind, the caudate nucleus; and it is fueled by at least one of nature’s most
powerful stimulants, dopamine. When one’s passion is returned, the brain tacks
on positive emotions, such as elation and hope. When one’s love is spurned or
thwarted instead, the brain links this motivation with negative feelings, such as
despair and rage. And all the while, regions of the prefrontal cortex monitor the
pursuit, planning tactics, calculating gains and losses, and registering one’s
progress toward the goal: emotional, physical, even spiritual union with the
beloved.
“The BRAIN—is wider than the sky—,” wrote Emily Dickinson.
44
Indeed,
this three-pound blob can generate a need so intense that all the world has sung
of it: romantic love. And to make our lives even more complex, romantic
passion is intricately enmeshed with two other basic mating drives, the sex drive
and the urge to build a deep attachment to a romantic partner. Ah, the web of

Web of Love: Lust, Romance, and Attachment
O love is the crooked thing,
There is nobody wise enough
To find out all that is in it,
For he would be thinking of love
Till the stars had run away
And the shadows eaten the moon.
Ah, penny, brown penny, brown penny,
One cannot begin it too soon.
William Butler Yeats
“Brown Penny”
Love is “as sweet and musical As bright Apollo’s lute, strung with his hair. And
when Love speaks, the voices of all the gods / Makes heaven drowsy with the
harmony.”
1 Love is a harmony, as Shakespeare wrote, sometimes even a
cacophony of sensations. Exuberance, tenderness, compassion, possessiveness,
rapture, adoration, longing, despair: romance is a kaleidoscopic pattern of
shifting needs and feelings all tethered to a celestial being on whose slightest
word or smile one dangles, spinning with hope and joy and craving. Complexity,
thy name is love.
Yet with time and circumstance, nature has built a few major chords within
this symphony. Romantic love is deeply entwined with two other mating drives:
lust—the craving for sexual gratification; and attachment—the feelings of calm,
security, and union with a long-term partner.
2
Each of these basic mating drives travels along different pathways in the
brain. Each produces different behaviors, hopes, and dreams. And each is
associated with different neurochemicals. Lust is associated primarily with the
hormone testosterone in both men and women. Romantic love is linked with the
natural stimulant dopamine and perhaps norepinephrine and serotonin. And
feelings of male-female attachment are produced primarily by the hormones
oxytocin and vasopressin.
Moreover, each brain system evolved to direct a different aspect of
reproduction. Lust evolved to motivate individuals to seek sexual union with
almost any semi-appropriate partner. Romantic love emerged to drive men and
women to focus their mating attention on a preferred individual, thereby
conserving invaluable courtship time and energy. And the brain circuitry for
male-female attachment developed to enable our ancestors to live with this mate
at least long enough to rear a single child through infancy together.
3
All three of these brain networks—lust, romantic attraction, and attachment
—are multipurpose systems. In addition to its reproductive purpose, the sex
drive serves to make and keep friends, provide pleasure and adventure, tone
muscles, and relax the mind. Romantic love can stimulate you to sustain a loving
partnership or drive you to fall in love with a new person and initiate divorce.
And feelings of attachment enable us to express genuine affection for children,
family, and friends, as well as a beloved.
Nature is conservative. When she has a good design, she sticks with it,
expanding its uses to suit many situations. But the primary purpose of these
interlocking drives is to motivate us to seek an array of sexual partners, choose
one to dote upon, then remain emotionally engaged with “him” or “her” at least
long enough to rear a child together—the basics of the mating game.
To understand how romantic passion affects the sex drive and feelings of
long-term attachment, I embarked on a research project with Jonathan Stieglitz,
then a student at Rutgers University. We mined MedLine, PubMed, and other
search engines on the Internet for academic articles illustrating how the
chemistry of these three mating drives—lust, romantic attraction, and attachment
—affect one another.
Indeed, romantic love weaves its way through these other brain networks in
ways that both enrich and tear the fabric of our lives.
On Lust
“What arms and shoulders did I touch and see, / How apt her breasts were to be
pressed by me, How smooth a belly under her waist saw I, How large a leg, and
what a lusty thigh. To leave the rest, all liked me passing well; I clinged her
naked body, down she fell: Judge you the rest, being tired she bade me kiss; Jove
send me more such afternoons as this!”
4 Ovid, the Roman poet, was one of
countless millions who have savored lust.
Lust is a primordial human feeling. It is unpredictable, too. The craving for
sexual fulfillment can pop up in your mind as you are driving in your car,
watching a movie on TV, reading in the office, or daydreaming on the beach.
And this urge is very different from the feeling of romantic love. In fact, few
people in Western societies confuse the elation of romance with the longing for
sexual release.
5
People in far different cultures also easily distinguish between these
feelings.
6 On the Polynesian island of Mangaia, “real love” is called inangaro
kino, a state of romantic passion quite distinct from one’s sexual desires. In their
native language, the Taita of Kenya call lust ashiki while they refer to love as
pendo.
7 And in Caruaru, a town in northeast Brazil, locals say, “Amor is when
you feel a desire to always be with her, you breathe her, eat her, drink her, you
are always thinking of her, you don’t manage to live without her.”
8 Paixao, on
the other hand, is “horniness” and tesao is “a very strong sexual attraction for a
person.”
9
These people are correct to regard these feelings as distinct. Scientists have
recently established that lust and romantic love are associated with different
constellations of brain regions.
10
In one study researchers scanned the brains of a
group of young heterosexual men using the fMRI brain scanner. The men were
shown three types of videos: some were erotic, some relaxing, some related to
sports.
11 Each volunteer wore a custom-built pneumatic pressure cuff around his
penis to record firmness. The pattern of brain activity was quite different from
the one we found among the love-sick subjects in our brain scanning project.
Lust and romantic love are not the same.
And just as people everywhere have concocted love potions to spur romance,
they have tried all sorts of potions to trigger lust—what an Italian proverb calls
“the oldest lion of them all.”
The Hormone of Desire
“Candy is dandy, but liquor is quicker,” quipped Ogden Nash. Everywhere
humankind has used what they hoped was an aphrodisiac to trigger lust. When
the tomato first crossed the Atlantic from the Americas, the Europeans thought
this juicy red fruit would spark the sexual appetite; they called it the “love
apple.” Shark’s fins, bird’s nest soup, powdered rhinoceros horn, curry, chutney,
mandrake root, chocolate, hyena eyes, caviar, clams, oysters, lobsters, dove
brains, goose tongues, apples, bananas, cherries, dates, figs, peaches,
pomegranates, asparagus, garlic, beer, perspiration: scents and tastes and
ointments of dazzling variety have been employed to charm reluctant partners
into bed.
The Elizabethans served free prunes in brothels because they were convinced
this spurred lust. In past centuries Arabs tried to lure hesitant women into
sampling a bit of camel hump to pique their sexual desire. Pliny wrote that
hippopotamus snouts would do the trick. The Aztecs saw sexual magic in goat
and rabbit parts because these animals were fast breeders. Sea slugs caught the
fancy of the Chinese, largely because these strange animals enlarge when
touched. And Europeans historically pulverized a certain type of beetle found in
southern Europe to incite sexual desire; they called it Spanish fly.
12
Eating increases blood pressure and the pulse rate, raises body temperature,
and sometimes makes us sweat, physiological changes that also occur with sex.
Perhaps this is why men and women have long associated different foods with
sexual excitement. But nature has made only one true substance to stimulate
sexual desire in men and women—testosterone, and to a lesser degree, its kin,
the other male sex hormones.
This is well established. Men and women who have higher circulating levels
of testosterone tend to engage in more sexual activity.
13 Male athletes who inject
testosterone to elevate their strength and stamina have more sexual thoughts,
more morning erections, more sexual encounters, and more orgasms. And
women who take testosterone in middle age boost their sexual desire. The male
libido peaks in the early twenties, when levels of testosterone are highest. And
many women feel more sexual desire around ovulation, when levels of
testosterone increase.
14
As elevated levels of testosterone stimulate the sex drive, declining levels
dampen it. Both sexes have fewer sexual fantasies, masturbate less regularly, and
engage in less intercourse as they age.
15 Poor health, unhappiness, overwork,
lack of opportunity, laziness, and boredom undoubtedly contribute to this waning
lust. But with age, levels of testosterone decline, often depressing sex desire.
Some two-thirds of middle-aged women do not experience any decline in
libido, however.
16 This, too, may be due to testosterone. As the estrogens decline
with menopause, levels of testosterone and the other androgens become
unmasked: these potent hormones can finally express themselves more fully.
Indeed, they do. In one study of middle-aged women, almost 40 percent
complained that they were not having enough sex.
17
When it comes to sexual desire, people vary, in part because levels of
testosterone are inherited.
18 Levels also fluctuate according to the day, the week,
the year, and the life cycle. Moreover, the balance of testosterone, estrogen, and
other bodily ingredients, as well as social circumstances and a host of other
factors, all play a role in when, where, and how often we feel lust.
19
Nevertheless, testosterone is central to this appetite. And this primordial
chemical can swamp the thinking brain. As poet Tony Hoagland said of lust, “As
long as there is desire, we are not safe.”
20
Men and women are often sexually stimulated by different things, however.
Men like to look. They are sexually turned on by visual stimuli. Even when men
fantasize, they conjure up vivid images of body parts and copulation.
21 This
lascivious peering probably boosts levels of testosterone. When male monkeys
see a sexually available female or watch a companion copulate with a female,
their levels of testosterone soar.
22 So the men who go to strip bars or look at
“girlie” magazines are probably boosting levels of testosterone and triggering
lust.
Women are generally more turned on by romantic words, images, and themes
in films and stories. Women’s sexual fantasies also include more affection,
commitment, and sex with familiar partners.
23 And women like to yield. About
70 percent of American men and women fantasize while making love.
24 But as
conquest is at the core of most men’s mental plots, active surrender is prevalent
in women’s sexual reveries.
25
These tastes for conquest and surrender have nothing to do with rape. Less
than half of 1 percent of men enjoy forcing a woman into coitus; and less than
half of 1 percent of women want to be coerced into copulation.
26 Still, American
women are twice as likely as men to actively fantasize about being “done to” as
opposed to “doing.”
27
Danger, novelty, particular smells and sounds, love letters, candy, endearing
conversations, sexy clothes, swaying music, elegant dinners: many cues can
trigger that “eternal thirst,” as poet Pablo Neruda called the sex drive. How do
feelings of romantic love affect this primordial brain circuit, lust?
Romance Triggers Lust
Surely you have noticed that when you fall in love, your ardor stimulates the sex
drive. Novelists, dramatists, poets, and songwriters all rhapsodize about this urge
to kiss, cuddle, and make love to someone you adore.
Why do we feel lust when we fall in love?
Because dopamine, the liquor of romance, can stimulate the release of
testosterone, the hormone of sexual desire.
28
This relationship between elevated levels of dopamine and sexual arousal,
frequency of intercourse, and positive sexual function is common in animals.
29
When dopamine is injected into a male rat’s bloodstream, for example, it
stimulates copulatory behaviors.
30 Moreover, when a male laboratory rat is
placed in an adjacent cage where he can see or smell an estrous female, he
becomes sexually excited; with this, levels of dopamine also rise.
31 And when
the barrier is removed and he is allowed to copulate, levels of dopamine rise
even higher.
32
Dopamine can also stimulate lust in humans.
33 When men and women who
are depressed take drugs that elevate levels of dopamine in the brain, their sex
drive regularly improves.
34
A friend of mine in her thirties told me a remarkable story regarding this. She
had been mildly depressed for several years, so recently she began to take one of
the newer antidepressants (one without negative sexual side effects) that elevates
levels of dopamine in the brain. A month after starting this drug she not only
thought more about sex, but she had also begun to have multiple orgasms with
her boyfriend. I suspect her sudden change in sexual desire and sexual function
occurred because the pill she was taking daily to enhance dopamine triggered the
release of testosterone as well.
This positive relationship between dopamine and testosterone may also
explain why people feel so sexy when they go on vacation, try some new trick in
the bedroom, or make love to a new partner. Novel experiences drive up levels
of dopamine in the brain—hence they can also trigger the brain chemistry of
lust.
Norepinephrine, another stimulant that probably plays a role in romantic
love, also stimulates the sex drive. Addicts who take amphetamines, known as
“uppers” or “speed,” say their sex drive can be constant. This lustiness probably
stems from the same biological equation: amphetamines largely boost
norepinephrine (as well as dopamine). And norepinephrine can stimulate the
production of testosterone.
35
Once again some caveats: the dosage of all these chemicals, as well as the
timing of their release in the brain, makes a difference. None of these
interactions are direct or simple. But generally speaking, dopamine and
norepinephrine spark sexual desire,
36 most likely by elevating levels of
testosterone. No wonder new lovers stay up all night caressing. The chemistry of
romance ignites the most powerful urge of nature: the drive to copulate.
This chemical connection between romantic love and lust makes
evolutionary sense. After all, if romantic love evolved to stimulate mating with a
“special” other, it should trigger the drive to have sex with this beloved, too.
Does Lust Trigger Romance?
But is the reverse true? Can lust stimulate amour? Can you climb in bed with
“just a friend” or even a stranger, then suddenly fall in love with him or her?
Ovid, a man who had many love affairs, believed that a strong sexual
attraction could often provoke a person to fall in love.
37 But lust does not always
trigger romantic ardor, as many people know. Most sexually liberated
contemporary adults have had sex with someone they were not in love with.
Many have even copulated with this “friend” regularly. But, alas, they never felt
the exhilaration of romantic passion for this bed partner. Lust does not
necessarily lead to the passion and obsession of romantic love.
In fact, there is a great deal of data to the contrary. Athletes who inject
synthetic androgens to build muscles don’t fall in love as they take their drugs.
When middle-aged men and women inject testosterone or apply testosterone
cream to various body parts to stimulate their sex drive, their sexual thoughts
and fantasies increase.
38 But they don’t fall in love either. The brain circuitry of
lust does not necessarily ignite the furnace of romance.
This is not to say that lust never triggers romantic love. It can. A middle-aged
friend of mine is a good example. She had been having sex with “just a friend”
for almost three years. These were sporadic events, she told me; she and her
friend had sex no more than two or three times annually. Then one summer
evening, about five minutes after coupling with him, she fell profoundly in love
with him. At that moment the obsessive thinking, the pining, and the rapture
started. In the weeks and months that followed, she told me, she lay awake at
night and thought of him constantly, waited by the phone to hear his voice,
dressed attractively to win him, and fantasized about a life together. Fortunately
he loved her, too.
“Naso pasyo, maya basyo.” Women in rural western Nepal use this off-color
saying to express the same phenomenon. It means, “The penis entered and love
arrived.”
39
I think biology contributes to this spontaneous love for a sex partner. Sexual
activity can increase brain levels of dopamine and norepinephrine in male rats.
40
Even without sexual activity, increasing levels of testosterone can elevate levels
of dopamine
41 and norepinephrine
42 as well as suppress levels of serotonin.
43
In
short, the hormone of sexual desire can trigger the release of the brain’s elixirs
for romantic passion. As my friend cuddled and copulated with “just a friend,” I
think she triggered her brain circuit for romance and fell in love.
That “ol’ black magic” is a fickle force. The chemistry of romantic love can
trigger the chemistry of sexual desire and the fuel of sexual desire can trigger the
fuel of romance. This is why it is dangerous to copulate with someone with
whom you don’t wish to become involved. Although you intend to have casual
sex, you might just fall in love.
Romantic passion also has a special relationship with feelings of attachment.
On Attachment
“Who ordered that their longing’s fire / Should be, as soon as kindled, cooled?”
44
Poet Matthew Arnold mourned the passing of romantic love.
Love changes over time. It becomes deeper, calmer. No longer do couples
talk all day or dance till dawn. The mad passion, the ecstasy, the longing, the
obsessive thinking, the heightened energy: all dissolve. But if you are fortunate,
this magic transforms itself into new feelings of security, comfort, calm, and
union with your partner. Psychologist Elaine Hatfield calls this feeling
“companionate love,” a feeling of happy togetherness with someone whose life
has become deeply entwined with yours.
45
I call this complex feeling
“attachment.”
And just as men and women intuitively distinguish between the feelings of
romantic love and those of lust, people just as easily distinguish between
feelings of romance and attachment.
Nisa, a !Kung Bushman woman of the Kalahari Desert of Botswana,
explained this feeling of man-woman attachment succinctly to anthropologist
Marjorie Shostak. “When two people are first together,” Nisa said, “their hearts
are on fire and their passion is very great. After a while, the fire cools and that’s
how it stays. They continue to love each other, but it’s in a different way—warm
and dependable.”
46
The Taita of Kenya would agree. They say that love comes in two forms, an
irresistible longing, a “kind of sickness,” and a deep enduring affection for
another.
47 Brazilians have a poetic proverb that distinguishes between these two
feelings, saying, “Love is born in a glance and matures in a smile.”
48 And for the
Koreans, “sarang” is a word close to the Western concept of romantic love,
while “chong” is more like feelings of long-term attachment. But perhaps
Abigail Adams, the wife of America’s second president, said it best, writing to
John in 1793, “Years subdue the ardor of passion, but in lieu thereof friendship
and affection deep-rooted subsists, which defies the ravages of time, and whilst
the vital flame exists.”
49
The Chemistry of Attachment
Scientists began to examine this brain system, attachment, decades ago when
British psychiatrist John Bowlby proposed that humans have evolved an innate
attachment system consisting of specific behaviors and physiological
responses.
50 Only recently, however, have researchers begun to understand which
brain chemicals produce this feeling of fusion with a long-term mate. Most now
believe that vasopressin and oxytocin, closely related hormones made largely in
the hypothalamus and the gonads, produce many of the behaviors associated
with attachment.
But to grasp how these hormones generate the sensation of union with a
sweetheart, I must reintroduce you to the American midwesterners discussed
earlier: prairie voles. As you recall, these brown-gray, mouselike rodents form
pair-bonds to rear their young; some 90 percent mate for life with a single
partner. A few years ago neuroscientists Sue Carter, Tom Insel, and others
pinpointed the cause of this attachment in males. As the male prairie vole
ejaculates, levels of vasopressin increase in the brain, triggering his spousal and
parenting zeal.
51
Is vasopressin nature’s cocktail for male attachment?
To investigate this hypothesis, scientists then injected vasopressin into the
brains of virgin male prairie voles raised in the lab. These males immediately
began to defend the space around them from other males, an aspect of pair
formation in prairie voles. And when each was introduced to a female, he
became instantaneously possessive of her.
52 Moreover, when these same
scientists blocked the production of vasopressin in the brain, male prairie voles
acted like cads instead—copulating with a female, then abandoning her for
another mating opportunity.
Nature has given male mammals a chemical to feel the paternal instinct:
vasopressin.
Oxytocin: Another Cocktail for Devotion?
“So we grew together, / Like to a double cherry, seeming parted, But yet a union
in partition; / Two lovely berries moulded on one stem.”
53 Few poets write about
the durable feeling of attachment, perhaps because this drive rarely compels one
to compose passionate verse in the dead of night. These lines by Shakespeare are
an exception. Yet the feeling of attachment must be a common sensation among
all birds and mammals, because it is associated not only with vasopressin but
also with oxytocin—a related hormone that is ubiquitous in nature.
54
Like vasopressin, oxytocin is made in the hypothalamus, as well as in the
ovaries and testes. Unlike vasopressin, oxytocin is released in all female
mammals (including women) during the birthing process.
55
It initiates
contractions of the uterus and stimulates the mammary glands to produce milk.
But scientists have now established that oxytocin also stimulates bonding
between a mother and her infant.
More important, many now believe that oxytocin is also involved in the
feelings of adult male-female attachment.
56
You have undoubtedly felt the power of these two “satisfaction hormones,”
as vasopressin and oxytocin are sometimes called. We secrete them at two
poignant moments during sexual intercourse: during stimulation of the genitals
and/or nipples
57 and during orgasm. At orgasm, levels of vasopressin
dramatically increase in men and levels of oxytocin rise in women.
58 These
“cuddle chemicals” undoubtedly contribute to that sense of fusion, closeness,
and attachment you can feel after sweet sex with a beloved.
How does the chemistry of attachment affect feelings of lust and romantic
love?
Does Lust Dampen Attachment?
The chemical components of attachment have complex effects on both the sex
drive and feelings of romantic passion.
Under some circumstances, testosterone can elevate levels of vasopressin
59
and oxytocin
60
in animals, increasing attachment behaviors such as mutual
grooming, scent marking, and defending a nesting site.
61 The reverse can also
happen: oxytocin and vasopressin can increase testosterone production under
some conditions.
62
In short, the chemistry of attachment can trigger lust and the
chemistry of lust can trigger expressions of attachment.
But all these hormones can also have negative effects on one another.
Increasing levels of testosterone can sometimes drive down levels of vasopressin
(and oxytocin) and elevated levels of vasopressin can decrease levels of
testosterone.
63 This inverse relationship between lust and attachment is “dosedependent”; it varies depending on the quantities, timing, and interactions among
several hormones.
64 But high levels of testosterone can reduce attachment. And
there is a great deal of evidence that this happens to people regularly—
sometimes with disastrous effects.
Men with high baseline levels of testosterone marry less frequently, have
more adulterous affairs, commit more spousal abuse, and divorce more often. As
a man’s marriage becomes less stable, his levels of testosterone rise. With
divorce, his testosterone levels rise even more. And single men tend to have
higher levels of testosterone than married men.
65
The reverse can also happen: as a man becomes more and more attached to
his family, levels of testosterone can decline. In fact, at the birth of a child,
expectant fathers experience a significant decline in levels of testosterone.
66
Even when a man holds a baby, levels of testosterone decrease.
This negative relationship between testosterone and attachment is also seen
in other creatures. Male cardinals and blue jays flit from one female to the next;
they never stick around to parent their young. These profligate fathers have high
levels of testosterone. Males of species that form monogamous pair-bonds and
remain with this mate to father infants, however, have much lower levels of
testosterone during the parenting phase of the breeding season.
67 And when
scientists surgically pumped testosterone into monogamous male sparrows, these
faithful fathers abandoned their nests, their young, and their “wives” to court
other females.
68
As I have said, the interactions between these chemical systems for lust and
attachment are complex and variable. But there is data to suggest that as people
grow like “two lovely berries moulded on one stem,” the chemistry of
attachment can dampen lust. This is probably why men and women in long
stable marriages tend to spend less time in their bedroom making love.
But what about romance? How does dopamine, the fuel of romantic love,
affect levels of vasopressin and oxytocin, the brain’s intoxicants for attachment?
Do deep feelings of union and attachment enhance or stifle romantic passion?
Romance and Attachment?
Nature isn’t tidy. She likes options. And there is no definite relationship between
the neurotransmitters of romance and the hormones of attachment. As should be
said of all these chemical interactions: it depends.
Under some circumstances, dopamine and norepinephrine can stimulate the
release of oxytocin and vasopressin
69—and contribute to one’s growing feelings
of attachment. But increasing levels of oxytocin (found in both men and women)
can also interfere with dopamine and norepinephrine pathways in the brain,
decreasing the impact of these excitatory substances.
70 Hence the chemistry of
attachment can quell the chemistry of romance.
There is a great deal of anecdotal evidence for this negative chemical
relationship between attachment and romantic love. People around the world say
the exhilaration of romance wanes as their marriage or partnership becomes
increasingly stable, comfortable, and secure. Some even go to psychiatrists or
marriage counselors to try to renew romantic passion in their relationship. Some
seek romance outside their marriage instead. Some divorce. And many settle into
a long-term partnership devoid of romantic bliss.
I have mixed feelings about this fate nature has decreed. First, many of us
would die of sexual exhaustion if romantic love flourished endlessly in a
relationship. We wouldn’t get to work on time or concentrate on anything except
“him” or “her.” Moreover, as romantic love matures, it often expands into
hundreds of complex and fulfilling feelings of attachment that produce an
enormously intricate, interesting, and emotionally rewarding union with another
living soul.
At the same time, I think you can keep the primal flame of romantic ecstasy
alive in a long-term comfortable relationship, as I will discuss in chapter eight.
But to maintain that magic you have to play a few tricks on the brain. Why?
Because romantic love did not evolve to help us maintain a stable, enduring
partnership. It evolved for different purposes: to drive ancestral men and women
to prefer, choose, and pursue specific mating partners, then start the mating
process and remain sexually faithful to “him” or “her” long enough to conceive a
child. After the child is born, however, parents need a new set of chemicals and
brain networks to rear their infant as a team—the chemistry of attachment. As a
result, feelings of attachment often dampen the ecstasy of romance, replacing it
with a deep sense of union with a mate.
The Trellis of Love
In spite of this evolutionary trajectory of loving, in which romantic passion
gradually transforms into feelings of deep attachment, these three brain circuits
—lust, romantic love, and attachment—can ignite in any combination.
In the traditional Western course of events, you meet a man or woman. You
talk and laugh and begin to “date.” Rapidly or gradually you fall in love. As the
camaraderie escalates to bliss, your sex drive surges into higher action. Then
after months or years of joyous times together, your raging romantic passion and
raw sexual hunger begin to wane, replaced by what Theodor Reik called that
warm “afterglow,”
71 attachment. In this scenario, romantic love has triggered
lust; then with time, these raw feelings of passion and desire have settled into a
sinew of emotional union and commitment—attachment.
Lust, romance, and attachment can visit you in other sequences, however.
You may begin a liaison with someone for whom you feel only sexual desire.
For a few months you have sex irregularly. Then one day you begin to feel
possessive. Soon you fall in love with “him” or “her.” And over time you
become deeply emotionally entwined. In this case, lust has preceded romance,
which then led to attachment.
Then there are couples who actually begin their relationship with feelings of
attachment. They quickly achieve emotional union in the college dorm, at the
office, or in their social circle. They become fast friends. With time, this
attachment metamorphoses into romantic passion—which finally triggers lust.
Alas, many of us also have periods in our lives when these three mating
drives—lust, romantic love, and attachment—do not focus on the same person. It
seems to be the destiny of humankind that we are neurologically able to love
more than one person at a time. You can feel profound attachment for a longterm spouse, while you feel romantic passion for someone in the office or your
social circle, while you feel the sex drive as you read a book, watch a movie, or
do something else unrelated to either partner. You can even swing from one
feeling to another.
In fact, as you lie in the dark at night you can become engulfed by feelings of
attachment to your spouse; then seconds later you feel crazy romantic passion
for someone you just met; then you become aware of sexual craving as an
unrelated image sweeps into mind. As these three brain circuits fire interactively,
yet independently, you feel as if you are having a committee meeting in your
head.
“Wild is love,” as the song goes. Lust, romantic love, and deep attachment
can visit you in such different and unexpected combinations that many people
have come to believe the mixture of sensations that draws you to another is
mysterious, elusive, perhaps even heaven-sent. But once you begin to envisage
lust, romantic love, and attachment as three specific mating drives, each
producing many gradations of feeling that endlessly combine and recombine in
countless different ways, love takes on tangibility. Even the elaborate love
schemas of the classical Greeks make sense.
Types of Love
The ancient Greeks were the world’s masters at scrutinizing various kinds of
love. They had over ten words to distinguish different types. Psychologist John
Alan Lee reduced these overlapping categories into six.
72 But to my mind, each
appears to be a different blend of the three basic mating circuits in the brain: lust,
romantic love, and attachment.
The most celebrated is eros, or passionate, sexual, erotic, joyful, high-energy
love for a very special partner. I think eros is a combination of lust and romantic
love.
Mania is obsessive, jealous, irrational, possessive, dependent love. Most
people are exceedingly obsessive, illogical, and possessive when they are
passionately in love.
Ludus (rhymes with Brutus) is the Latin word for game or play. This is
playful, unserious, uncommitted, detached love. These lovers can love more than
one person at a time. For them, love is theater, an art form. Ludus appears to be a
variation of mild lust coupled with fun and frivolity.
Storge (rhymes with “more gay”) is an affectionate companionate, brotherly,
sisterly, friendly kind of love, a deep and special friendship that lacks a display
of emotion. These people prefer to talk about their interests rather than their
feelings. This is “love without fever or folly,” as Proudhon put it. To me, storge
is a form of attachment.
Agape is a gentle, unselfish, dutiful, all-giving, altruistic, often spiritual love
—another form of attachment. These lovers regard their sentiments as a duty, not
a passion. Some are even willing to give up the relationship when it is best for
the beloved; hence they will surrender willingly to a rival.
Last is pragma, love based on compatibility and common sense: pragmatic
love. This is “shopping list” love. Pragmatic lovers keep score; they look for the
perks of the relationship as well as its flaws. These men and women are not
moved to excessive sacrifice or emotion. For them, friendship is a core of the
relationship. I don’t regard pragma as love at all.
There is a great deal of psychological literature on types of love, as well as
on the various components of love and styles of loving.
73 One conceptualization
of love that is popular among contemporary social scientists is that of
psychologist Robert Sternberg.
Sternberg divides love into three basic ingredients: passion—including
romance, physical attraction, and sexual craving; intimacy—all of those feelings
of warmth, closeness, connectedness, and bondedness; and decision/commitment
—the decision to love someone and the commitment to sustain that love.
74 To
him, infatuation is composed of passion only. Romantic love is passion plus
intimacy. Consummate love is passion, intimacy, and commitment.
Companionate love has intimacy and commitment but is devoid of passion.
Empty love has only commitment; one goes through the gestures of loving but
only feelings of commitment hold the relationship together. Liking is based on
intimacy; one feels no passion and no commitment. And fatuous love is often
full of passion and commitment, but lacks intimacy.
The Mad Symphony of Romance
“Love is such a tissue of paradoxes, and exists in such a variety of forms and
shades, that you may say almost anything about it that you please, and it is likely
to be correct.” So claimed Queen Victoria’s behavioral scientist, Sir Henry
Finck.
75 Romantic love certainly has subtle variations, as well as intricate and
varied relationships with its kindred reproductive drives, lust, and attachment.
Love is a symphony of feelings with many notes and chords.
To make matters even more complex, the brain network for romantic love
melds with many more brain systems with circuits for other basic drives, as well
as with many emotions, memories, and thoughts. All these ingredients add
fantastic depth, nuance, and spice to our feelings of romance.
Certainly our emotions contribute to romantic passion. Human emotions lie
along a continuum, from those that are so basic that they are almost impossible
to hide (such as disgust) to those like envy that we can more easily conceal. The
basic emotions are universal, inherited, involuntary, rapidly expressed, portrayed
everywhere with the same facial poses, hard to fake, and often difficult to
control.
76 Among them are fear, anger, joy, sadness, disgust, and surprise.
Certainly the drive to love commandeers all of these basic emotions at one
time or another. As you feel an irresistible urge to phone “him” or “her,” you can
become engulfed with fear that your lover has gone out with a rival, then
overwhelmed with joy as he or she answers the phone and says, “I love you,”
then pummeled by surprise and disappointment as this celestial being breaks the
dinner date you had planned together.
Romantic love is also linked to a host of more complex feelings. Respect,
admiration, loyalty, gratitude, sympathy, apprehension, bashfulness, nostalgia,
remorse, even the sense of fairness: philosopher Dylan Evans calls these “higher
cognitive emotions”
77 because they are not fast-acting or associated with specific
facial mannerisms; people in different societies express them in different ways
and at different times; and men and women are often able to conceal and fake
them. We tack on dozens of these complex emotions while we are in the throes
of romantic love.
Calm, tension, contentment, anxiety, mild pain, mild pleasure, and other
general bodily states also contribute to feelings of romantic love. As neurologist
Antonio Damasio puts it, these “background emotions” provide the landscape of
the body, the persistent mood that accompanies us as stronger emotions and
motivations ebb and surge.
78 Only occasionally do these background states gush
into your conscious mind. But these steady undercurrents of anxiety, pain, and
pleasure certainly color our feelings for a beloved.
Most compelling, this trellis of emotions and motivations is hierarchically
ordered in the brain. Fear can overcome joy, for example. Jealousy can stifle
tenderness. The juxtapositions are manifold. But in this pecking order of basic
and complex emotions, background feelings and powerful drives, romantic love
holds a special place: close to the zenith, the pinnacle, the top. Romantic love
can dominate the drive to eat and sleep. It can stifle fear, anger, or disgust. It can
override one’s sense of duty to family and friends. It can even triumph over the
will to live. As Keats said, “I could die for you.”
“How do I love thee? Let me count the ways,” wrote Elizabeth Barrett
Browning. There are so many ways. Like a chord on a piano, the feeling of
romantic passion harmonizes with myriad other feelings, drives, and thoughts to
create different melodies in different keys. Moreover, each of us is wired
somewhat differently. Some are predisposed to happiness; others to calm,
anxiety, fear, or anger; some are insatiably curious; others wonderfully amusing.
Scientists say that about 50 percent of our temperament is inherited; the rest is
molded by our upbringing and environment. But we all share this wondrous—
and devilish—thing called romantic love.
How do you and I fish in the sea of varied human beings to find our “special”
other? What makes us choose “him” or “her”?

“That First Fine Careless Rapture”: Who We Choose
Somewhere there waiteth in this world of ours
For one lone soul, another lonely soul—
Each chasing each through all the weary hours,
And meeting strangely at one sudden goal;
Then blend they—like green leaves with golden flowers,
Into one beautiful and perfect whole—
And life’s long night is ended, and the way
Lies open onward to eternal day.
Sir Edwin Arnold
“Somewhere”
1
“She was so extraordinarily beautiful that I nearly laughed out loud. She …
[was] famine, fire, destruction and plague … the only true begetter. Her breasts
were apocalyptic, they would topple empires before they withered … her body
was a miracle of construction.… She was unquestionably gorgeous. She was
lavish. She was a dark, unyielding largesse. She was, in short, too bloody
much … those huge violet blue eyes … had an odd glint.… Aeons passed,
civilizations came and went while these cosmic headlights examined my flawed
personality. Every pockmark on my face became a crater of the moon.”
So thought Richard Burton when he first saw nineteen-year-old Elizabeth
Taylor. Why does a man walk into a room full of attractive women, speak to
several he finds charming, then fall head over heels in love with one? Why does
a woman with several suitors see a man for only moments before her brain
circuits fire up with romantic passion? Why does one person ignite these
primitive brain circuits while another perfectly lovely human being leaves us
totally unmoved? Why “him”? Why “her”?
Timing
“How can we know the dancer from the dance?” Yeats asked. Perhaps you have
been swept away by someone at a party, in the office, or on the beach; then later
wondered whether you just got caught up in the excitement of the moment. Your
craving to love and to be loved altered your vision—transforming a frog into a
prince or princess. You confused the dancer with the dance.
Love can be triggered when you least expect it—by pure chance. The perfect
partner can sit right next to you at a party and you might not notice him or her if
you are exceptionally busy at work or school, enmeshed in another relationship,
or otherwise emotionally preoccupied.
But if you just entered college or moved to a new city by yourself, recently
recovered from an unsatisfactory love affair, began to make enough money to
raise a family, are lonely or suffering through a difficult experience, or have too
much spare time, you are ripe to fall in love.
2
In fact, people who are emotionally
aroused, be it by joy, sadness, anxiety, fear, curiosity, or any other feeling, are
more likely to be vulnerable to this passion.
3
I suspect this is because all agitated mental states are associated with arousal
mechanisms in the brain, as well as with elevated levels of stress hormones.
Both systems elevate levels of dopamine—thus setting up the chemistry for
romantic passion.
Proximity
“Ah, I have picked up magic in her nearness,” wrote poet Ezra Pound. Quite
right; proximity can also spark this rapture. We tend to choose those who are
around us.
4
This was elegantly expressed by Terry, a man from Canada who recently
wrote me the following e-mail:
Dear Dr. Fisher, When I was in my “dating” years, I had certain expectations with respect to the
woman I would marry. She had to be this, that and the other thing too! What I overlooked was a
beautiful, caring, unselfish woman with wonderful goals literally living in my back yard! She met
none of my “expectations” but we started dating, lived together, fell in love and were married a year
later. It’s been 15 years now and our relationship has grown tremendously and continues to grow
every day. I guess what I’m trying to say is, take a step back and look around you. Don’t microanalyze every detail. Maybe your soul mate is closer than you think :).
Many other hidden forces play a role in whom you choose. Among them:
mystery.
Mystery
Both sexes are often attracted to those they find mysterious. As Baudelaire
wrote, “We love women in proportion to their degree of strangeness to us.” The
sense that one has a slippery grip on an elusive, improbable treasure can trigger
romantic passion.
The reverse is also true. Familiarity can deaden thoughts of romantic love—
as life on one Israeli kibbutz has shown. Here children grew up together in a
common house where they lived, slept, and bathed with other youths of all ages.
Boys and girls touched and lay together playfully. By age twelve, however, they
became tense with one another. Then as teenagers, they developed strong
brother-sister bonds. But none of those who started life in this common cradle
married a fellow kibbutznik.
5 So scientists now think that at a critical time in
childhood, sometime between ages three and six, boys and girls who live in
close proximity and get to know each other well lose the ability to fall in love
with one another.
This repugnance for mating with the familiar is common among mammals.
Almost all individuals of all species on record have a sexual aversion to closely
familiar others; they prefer to mate with strangers. So males (or females) usually
leave home at puberty to find sex partners in other groups. If a young male
remains in his natal community, as male rhesus monkeys do, he often behaves
like a child around his mother, snuggling in his sweetheart’s arms instead of
courting her to copulate. And in one recorded case of attempted incest among
chimpanzees, a sister violently repelled her brother—screaming, kicking, and
biting him before she wiggled away and fled.
You and I inherited this natural repulsion for copulation with close family
members and other individuals we know well, a distaste that undoubtedly
evolved to discourage in-breeding—the destructive act of mixing one’s DNA
with close kin. As a result, we are more likely to become attracted to someone
from outside our family or the group in which we were raised—someone with a
touch of mystery.
Nature has even given us the brain wiring to find strangers exciting.
Mysterious people are novel. And novelty is associated with elevated levels of
dopamine—the neurotransmitter of romance.
Do Opposites Attract?
Nevertheless, “that first fine careless rapture,” as Robert Browning called
romantic love, is generally directed toward someone much like one’s self. Most
people around the world do feel that amorous chemistry for unfamiliar
individuals of the same ethnic, social, religious, educational, and economic
background, who have a similar amount of physical attractiveness, a comparable
intelligence, and similar attitudes, expectations, values, interests, and social and
communication skills.
6
In fact, in a new study of mate selection in America, evolutionary biologists
Peter Buston and Stephen Emlen report that young men and women think of
themselves as particular types of marriage partners and choose people with the
same traits, ranging from financial and physical assets to intricacies of
personality.
7
If a woman is blessed with a trust fund, for example, she seeks
another from the upper class. Handsome men seek beautiful women. And those
devoted to family and sexual fidelity select someone with these attributes. The
mirror speaks. Men and women also gravitate to lovers who share their sense of
humor, to those with similar social and political values, and to individuals with
much the same beliefs about life in general.
8
Remarkably, scientists have established that many of these traits, including
your occupational interests, what you do in your leisure hours, many of your
social attitudes, even the strength of your faith in God, are influenced by your
genes.
9 So genetic types gravitate toward one another; we tend to be attracted to
people like ourselves.
Anthropologists call this human propensity to be drawn to someone like
yourself “positive assortive mating” or “fitness matching.” The specific kind of
person you actually choose, however, has been changing somewhat. The world is
seeing more interracial marriages, for example. In the United States these
weddings have increased some 800 percent since 1960.
10 But even in this time of
the global village, that fire in the mind is still most likely to ignite when you
meet an unfamiliar man or woman who is quite similar to you ethnically,
socially, and intellectually.
Like our attraction to unfamiliar people, this preference for partners like
oneself is probably evolutionary baggage. Why? Because a fetus and its mother
are foreigners to each other. If they share a similar chemical makeup, the mother
will have an easier time carrying the infant in her womb. In fact, mates who are
genetically similar experience fewer natural abortions and bear more and
healthier babies.
11
It is not advantageous to be too alike, however. And humans seem to have
evolved at least one mental mechanism to assure that we choose a partner who is
slightly different—chemically at least. This discovery stems from what has
become known as the “sweaty T-shirt” experiment. When women were asked to
smell men’s sweaty T-shirts and report on which they thought were the most
“sexy smelling,” they chose T-shirts of men with immune systems that were
unlike but compatible with their own.
12 Unconsciously these women were
attracted to individuals who could potentially help them produce genetically
more varied young.
So opposites attract—within the limits of one’s ethnic, social, and intellectual
sphere.
Symmetry: The “Golden Mean”
Another biological taste we have inherited from the animal kingdom is our
tendency to choose well-proportioned mates. Bodily symmetry can help to
trigger romantic love, as the ancient Greeks theorized. Almost twenty-five
hundred years ago Aristotle maintained that there were some universal standards
of physical beauty. One, he believed, was balanced bodily proportions, including
symmetry. This accorded with his high respect for what he called the golden
mean, or moderation between extremes.
Modern science supports Aristotle’s notion. Symmetry is beautiful—to
insects, birds, mammals, all of the primates, and people around the world.
13
Female scorpion flies seek mates with uniform wings. Barn swallows like
partners with well-proportioned tails. Monkeys are partial to consorts with
symmetrical teeth. If you walk into a village in New Guinea and point to the
most beautiful man or woman sitting around the campfire, the natives will agree
with you.
14 And when researchers used computers to blend many faces into a
composite “average” face, both men and women liked the average face better
than any of the individual ones.
15
It was more balanced. Even two-month-old
infants gaze longer at more symmetrical faces.
16
“Beauty is truth, truth beauty,” Keats wrote in his “Ode on a Grecian Urn.”
Keats’s words have puzzled many. But as it turns out, the beauty of symmetry
does tell a basic truth. Creatures with balanced, well-proportioned ears, eyes,
teeth, and jaws, with symmetrical elbows, knees, and breasts, have been able to
repel bacteria, viruses, and other minute predators that can cause bodily
irregularities. By displaying symmetry, animals advertise their superior genetic
ability to combat diseases.
17
So our human attraction to symmetrical suitors is a primitive animal
mechanism designed to guide us to select genetically sturdy mating partners.
18
And nature has taken no chances; the brain naturally responds to a beautiful
face. When scientists recorded the brain activity of heterosexual men ages
twenty-one to thirty-five as they looked at women with beautiful faces, the
ventral tegmental area (VTA) “lit up.”
19 A similar response occurred in our
scanning study: those subjects who gazed at photos of better-looking partners
showed more activity in the VTA. And the VTA is rich with dopamine—the
neurotransmitter that provides the energy, elation, focussed attention, and
motivation to win a reward.
Not surprisingly, symmetrical men and women often have many suitors to
choose from. As a result, exquisitely good-looking women tend to marry higher
status men,
20 Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis being a crowning example of this
matching process.
Highly symmetrical men also get reproductive perks. They begin to have sex
some four years earlier than their lopsided peers; they have more sex partners
and more adulterous affairs as well.
21 Women also achieve more orgasms with
symmetrical men,
22 even when this relationship is not emotionally satisfying to
them. And when a woman has an orgasm with a well-proportioned man, her
orgasmic contractions suck up more of his sperm.
23
I suspect these sexual responses occur because as the woman looks at her
symmetrical lover, the ventral tegmental area in her brain produces dopamine—
which (in a series of interactions) triggers testosterone and enhances the sexual
response.
Because symmetry enhances one’s choices in the mating game, women go to
extraordinary lengths to achieve it or at least a semblance of it. With powders
they make the two sides of the face more similar. With mascara and eyeliner,
they make their eyes appear more alike. With lipstick they enhance one lip to
match the other. And with plastic surgery, exercise, belts, bras, and tight jeans
and shirts, they mold their forms to create the symmetrical proportions men
prefer.
Nature helps. Scientists have found that women’s hands and ears are more
symmetrical during monthly ovulation—a time when it is reproductively
important to attract a man.
24 Women’s breasts become more symmetrical during
ovulation too.
25 Moreover, young men and young women are often quite
symmetrical; we become more and more lopsided as we age.
“Waist to Hip” Ratio
The golden mean of balance also applies to other bodily proportions.
To a group of American men, psychologist Devendra Singh displayed an
array of line drawings of young women and asked which body types they found
most attractive.
26 Most chose women whose waist circumference was about 70
percent of their hips. This experiment was then redone in Britain, Germany,
Australia, India, Uganda, and several other countries. Responses varied, but
many informants favored this same general waist-to-hip ratio.
When Singh measured the waist-to-hip ratio of 286 ancient sculptures from
several African tribes, as well as from ancient India, Egypt, Greece, and Rome,
he found that all favored a ratio that was smaller for women than for men. And
in a study of 330 artworks of Europe, Asia, the Americas, and Africa, some of
which date back thirty-two thousand years, scientists found that most women
were depicted with a waist-to-hip ratio of these same general proportions.
27
Interestingly, Playboy centerfolds display these proportions, too, as do American
“supermodels.” Even “Twiggy,” the gaunt supermodel of the 1960s, had a waistto-hip ratio of exactly 70 percent.
A woman’s waist-to-hip ratio is largely inherited; it is produced by genes.
Moreover, although it clearly varies from one woman to the next, this ratio
adjusts during ovulation to come closer to 70 percent. Why has nature gone to
such extraordinary lengths to produce curvaceous women? And why do men
around the world appreciate this particular waist-to-hip ratio in women?
Most likely for an evolutionary reason.
Women with a waist-to-hip ratio of around 70 percent are more likely to bear
babies, Singh reports. They possess the right amount of fat in the right places—
due to high levels of bodily estrogen in relation to testosterone. Women who
vary substantially from these proportions find it harder to get pregnant; they
conceive later in life; and they have more miscarriages. Egg-shaped, pearshaped, or stick-shaped: differently shaped women also suffer more from chronic
diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, certain cancers, and
problems with circulation. They are also prone to various personality disorders.
28
So Singh theorizes that male attraction to a specific female waist-to-hip ratio
is a natural preference for healthy, fertile partners. In fact, because this
preference is so deeply enmeshed in the male psyche, men of all ages express
this taste, even when they have no interest in fathering young themselves or are
courting women who are past the age of reproduction.
Of course, men prefer other things in women, too.
Who Men Choose
In a classic study of some ten thousand people in thirty-seven societies, scientists
asked men and women to rank eighteen characteristics in order of their
importance in choosing a spouse.
29 Both sexes ranked love or mutual attraction
first. A dependable character came next, followed by emotional stability and
maturity, and a pleasing disposition. Both men and women also said they would
choose someone who was kind, smart, educated, sociable, healthy, and interested
in home and family.
But this study also showed a distinct gender difference in romantic tastes.
When it came to sizing up potential romantic partners, men were more likely to
choose women who displayed visual signs of youth and beauty.
These masculine predilections are documented across millennia and
cultures.
30 Osiris, the legendary ruler of predynastic Egypt, was overwhelmed by
the physical beauty of his beloved wife, Isis. As he wrote over four thousand
years ago, “Isis has cast her net, and ensnared me in the noose of her hair I am
held by her eyes curbed by her necklace / imprisoned by the scent of her skin.”
31
A Tiv tribesman of Nigeria was swept away by the shapeliness of a woman,
exclaiming, “When I saw her dance she took my life away and I knew I must
follow her.”
32
American men who place courtship ads in newspapers and magazines are
three times more likely than women to mention that they seek beauty in a
partner.
33
And on average, men around the world marry women who are three years
younger than themselves.
34
In the United States, men who remarry usually
choose a woman about five years younger; if they wed a third time, they often
take a bride about eight years their junior.
35
When asked why people desire physical beauty, Aristotle replied: “No one
that is not blind could ask that question.” Men unquestionably find good-looking
women aesthetically pleasing to look at. They also like to impress friends and
colleagues with their dazzling girlfriends or trophy wives. In fact, people in
general tend to regard beautiful women (and good-looking men) as warm, smart,
strong, giving, friendly, polite, sexy, interesting, financially secure, and socially
popular.
36
But evolutionary psychologists now believe that men subconsciously also
prefer youth and beauty because it gives them reproductive payoffs.
37 Young
women with smooth skin, snow-white teeth, sparkling eyes, gleaming hair, taut
muscles, a lithe body, and a lively personality are more likely to be healthy and
energetic—good qualities for bearing and rearing babies. Smooth, clear skin and
babylike facial features also signal elevated levels of estrogen that can aid in
reproduction.
So these scientists theorize that across our long hunting/gathering past, those
males who chose youthful, healthy, exuberant partners had more children. These
robust babies lived—and passed along to contemporary men this male bias for
youthful, good-looking women.
38
The Male Brain in Love
“Why does a woman have to be beautiful rather than intelligent?”
“Because men can see better than they can think.”
It’s a stale joke; I know many men who think very well. But this tart
observation does contain a grain of truth. I say this because our fMRI study on
the brain circuitry of people in love turned up some unexpected results: we
found several gender differences.
39 These findings were complex and varied.
Men did not fit neatly in one category and women in another; as with all gender
differences, both sexes ranged in their responses to the photos of their
sweethearts; some even overlapped. Moreover, these variations may not be
common to all men or all women. But there were statistically significant
differences between the sexes. No one knows exactly what these findings mean.
But I will speculate about men for the moment and theorize about women later.
In our sample, men tended to show more activity than women in brain
regions associated with visual processing, particularly of the face.
Could this have evolved to enhance men’s ability to fall in love when they
saw a woman who was young, symmetrical, and a good reproductive bet?
Maybe. This brain activity could also help explain why men generally fall in
love faster than women.
40 When the time is right and a man sees an attractive
woman, he is anatomically equipped to rapidly associate attractive visual
features with feelings of romantic passion. What an effective courtship device.
Indeed, we found another gender difference that could have evolved to help
men court efficiently in yesteryear. When our subjects looked at their beloveds,
men tended to show more positive activity in a brain region associated with
penile erection. This makes Darwinian sense. The very purpose of romantic love
is to stimulate mating with a “special” other. This male response directly links
romantic passion with a brain region associated with sexual arousal.
Although this may be far-fetched, this male brain response may also shed
light on why men so avidly support the worldwide trade in visual pornography;
why women are more likely than men to regard their personal appearance as an
important component of their self-esteem;
41 and why women go to such
extraordinary lengths to advertise their assets visually, with all manner of
clothing, makeup, and ornaments. “If you can’t convince ’em, confuse ’em,”
maintained American president Harry Truman. Women agree. Unmercifully,
women take advantage of men’s fondness for—and brain response to—visual
stimuli.
Male “Mating Effort”
Another male penchant interests me because it also comes, I think, directly from
deep history. Psychologists report that men want to help women, to solve their
problems, to be useful by doing something.
42 Men feel manly when they rescue a
damsel in distress.
No doubt millions of years of protecting and providing for women has bred
into the male brain this tendency to choose women they feel they need to save.
In fact, the male brain is well built to assist women. Men are, on average, more
skilled at all sorts of mechanical and spatial tasks than women are. Men are
problem solvers.
43 And many of men’s particular skills are fashioned in the
womb by high levels of fetal testosterone. Perhaps men evolved this biological
machinery, at least in part, to attract, assist, and save women.
Men are also more single-minded than women when they love. Only 40
percent of the young women in my survey agreed with the statement: “Having a
good relationship with ___ is more important than having a good relationship
with my family,” whereas a solid 60 percent of young men reported that their
love relationship came first. Moreover, although most people think women are
the ones who wait by the phone, change their schedules, and hang around the
office or the gym to be available to a beloved, my questionnaire showed that
American men reorder their priorities more frequently than women do.
This male accessibility is far from new. Even Dante, the great Renaissance
Florentine poet, apparently lingered on a bridge over the Arno River for hours in
hopes of speaking with his beloved Beatrice.
This male penchant may be due to the fact that men have fewer intimate
connections with their natal families and friends than women. But deep
evolutionary forces probably contribute. Women are custodians of the egg—a
valuable commodity. And women expend much more time rearing infants and
small children, a vital job. For millions of years men needed to make themselves
available to potential mating partners, even risk their lives to save these precious
reproductive vessels.
Men are still obliged to expend more “mating effort” to win the courtship
game. In fact, men’s mating efforts were clearly visible in their responses to
several questions in my survey. For example, men were more worried that they
would say the wrong thing on a “date.” They were not as confident with their
words. This is understandable. On average, women everywhere in the world are
more skilled with the nuances of language, an ability linked to the female
hormone, estrogen.
44 But the women in my survey were also more likely to save
the cards and letters a lover sends. Women not only savored a suitor’s way with
words; unconsciously they were also keeping a record of his mating effort.
The Female Brain in Love
Much of the psychological literature reports that both sexes feel passionate
romantic love with roughly the same intensity.
45
I suspect this is true; their
responses are just somewhat different. For example, my questionnaire on this
passion (discussed in chapter one) showed that more American and Japanese
women than men reported feeling “lighter than air” when they were certain their
beloved felt passionately about them. Women also experienced slightly more
obsessive thinking about an amor.
Our fMRI experiment also showed several ways in which our female
subjects responded differently than our male participants. When women looked
at the photo of their beloved, they tended to show more activity in the body of
the caudate nucleus and the septum—brain regions associated with motivation
and attention. Parts of the septum are also associated with the processing of
emotion. Women also showed activity in some different brain regions, including
one associated with retrieval and recall of memories and some associated with
attention and emotion.
46
Once again, no one knows what these results mean. But as you recall
memories and register your emotions, you inform yourself about your feelings
47
and assemble information into patterns; both activities help you make decisions.
And for millions of years, women needed to make appropriate decisions about a
potential mating partner. If an ancestral woman became pregnant during a
romance, she was obliged to incubate the embryo for nine months, then deliver
the child. These were (and remain) metabolically costly, time-consuming,
uncomfortable, and physically dangerous tasks. Moreover, a woman had to raise
her helpless infant through a long childhood and adolescence.
While a man can see many of a woman’s assets for bearing and rearing
babies, a woman cannot see a man’s “mate value” just by looking. She must
compute a partner’s ability to protect and provide. And these gender differences
suggest that when a woman gazes at her lover, natural selection has given her
specific brain responses that enable her to recall the details and emotions she
needs to assess her man.
“Heredity is nothing but stored environment,” wrote the great botanist Luther
Burbank. The vicissitudes of rearing helpless infants in a hostile ancestral
environment have unquestionably bred into women other mechanisms they use
to choose a mate.
Who Women Choose
In a survey of eight hundred personal advertisements placed in newspapers and
magazines, American women sought partners who offered financial security
twice as frequently as men did.
48 Many female doctors, lawyers, and very
wealthy women are interested in men with even more money and status than
themselves.
49
In fact, women everywhere in the world are more attracted to
partners with education, ambition, wealth, respect, status, and position—the
kinds of assets their prehistoric predecessors needed in a parenting partner. As
scientists sum this up: men look for sex objects and women look for success
objects.
Women are also attracted to tall men, perhaps because towering men are
more likely to acquire prestige in business and politics and provide more bodily
defense.
50 Women like men who sit in a carefree position, a sign of dominance,
as well as men who are self-confident and assertive. Women are somewhat more
likely to choose a long-term partner who is smart.
51 And women respond to men
who are well-coordinated, strong, and courageous—as world literature and
legend attest.
Inanna, queen of ancient Sumeria, called her beloved “my fearless one / my
shining one.”
52
In the Song of Songs of the Old Testament, written between 900
and 300 B.C., the woman crooned: “My love is shining and ruddy. / He is the
tallest in a crowd of ten thousand men His arms are like rods of gold His legs are
pillars of marble.”
53 And in a nineteenth-century poem by an anonymous Somali
woman, the poet gushed, “You are strong as woven iron. / You are poured from
Nairobi gold, the first light of dawn, the blazing sun.”
No wonder a man’s self-respect is more tightly linked to his general status at
work and in the community.
54 No wonder men are also more likely to jeopardize
their health, safety, and spare time to achieve rank. Men intuitively know that to
attract youthful, healthy, energetic women, they must try to appear fearless,
strong as woven iron, as powerful as the blazing sun.
Women also prefer men with distinctive cheekbones and a strong jaw—for
another unconscious reason. Masculine cheekbones and a rugged jawline are
built with testosterone—and testosterone suppresses the immune system. Only
exceedingly healthy teenage boys can tolerate the effects of this and build a
rugged face.
55 Not surprisingly, around the time of monthly ovulation women
become even more interested in men with these signs of testosterone. Now they
can get pregnant, so they unconsciously seek males with superior genes.
Curiously, women who are likely to get pregnant are also more attracted to
men with a good sense of humor—perhaps because wit has been associated with
sharper general intelligence.
Biologist Randy Thornhill believes that women express two basic
preferences. Around ovulation they seek men with good genes, a remnant of
estrus found in all mammals. At other times of the menstrual cycle they favor
men who display signs of commitment. Indeed, when instructed to manipulate
computer images of male faces until they found the most attractive image, both
British and Japanese women preferred more masculine male faces around the
time of ovulation and softer, more feminine male faces at other times of the
menstrual cycle.
56 New data suggest, however, that women without a partner still
seek signs of commitment at ovulation.
To be expected, all the time women are attracted to men who are willing to
share their rank, their money, and their position. In fact, women are more
pragmatic and realistic when they love, whereas men tend to be either more
cynical or more idealistic and altruistic.
57 Perhaps this feminine pragmatism
explains why women fall in love more slowly than men do.
Casual Passion
The sexes become more flexible in their romantic choices when they are looking
for short-term love, such as when they are on vacation or seeking a temporary
romance while pursuing other interests.
Historically, women looking for short-term passion choose free-spending
men with resources—bestowers of gifts, lavish vacations, fancy dinners, and
social or political connections.
58 Frugality was not acceptable to a woman on a
fling. But today’s women are wealthier and more independent than in the
historical past and those pursuing casual passion are somewhat more eager to
choose tall, symmetrical men with chiseled cheekbones and rugged jaws, men
who are likely to have sturdy genes.
59
Some of these women are testing their own mate value—seeing what kind of
man they can attract.
60 Others use a casual relationship as a form of insurance
policy; they want a backup in case their own mate defects or becomes ill and
dies. But many women also use casual sex to “try out” a particular person for a
longer relationship.
Psychologists know this because women are less enthusiastic than men about
engaging in a one-night stand with someone who is married or involved in
another love relationship. Not only is this lover unavailable but his resources are
directed elsewhere. And since he is cheating on his established partner, he is
likely to be unfaithful to her as well. Most women don’t lower their standards for
brief love affairs either. They still seek a partner who is healthy, stable, funny,
kind, and generous. For women, casual sex is often not as casual as it is for
men.
61
When men seek short-term love, they tend to overlook a woman’s lack of
intelligence.
62 They also choose women who are less athletic, less educated, less
loyal, less stable, less humorous, and of a wider age range.
63 And unlike women,
they may even be attracted to a woman with a reputation for promiscuity. As
Mae West so aptly put it, “Men like women with a past because they hope
history will repeat itself.”
As men think of committing to a long-term mate, however, they become
picky about basic virtues. When it comes to wedding, both sexes are attracted to
partners for reasons that arise, in part, from their primordial (and often
unconscious) need to breed.
“Tell me where is fancy bred, / Or in the heart, or in the head? How begot,
how nourished? Reply, reply.”
64 We can answer much of Shakespeare’s question.
A taste for symmetry; men’s love of youthfulness and beauty and their need to
help women in distress; women’s attraction to men’s wealth and status: these
biological predilections can potentially trigger the brain circuitry for romantic
love. An element of mystery, along with similarities of background, education,
and beliefs, guide our tastes. Chance, timing, and proximity can also play a part
in who we choose.
But of all the forces that guide your mate selection, I think the most
important is your personal history, the myriad childhood, teenage, and adult
experiences that have shaped and reshaped your likes and dislikes throughout
your life. All these combine to create your largely unconscious psychological
chart, what is called your “love map.”
Love Maps
We grow up in a sea of moments that slowly sculpt our romantic choices. Your
mother’s wit and way with words; your father’s zest for politics and tennis; your
uncle’s love of boats and hiking; your sister’s interest in training dogs; how
people in your household use silence, express intimacy and anger; how those
around you handle money; the amount of laughter at the dinner table; what your
older brother finds challenging; your religious education and intellectual
pursuits; the pastimes of your school chums; what your grandmother finds
polite; how the community you live in views honor, justice, loyalty, gratitude,
and kindness; what teachers admire and deplore; what you see on television and
in the movies: these and thousands of other subtle forces build our individual
interests, values, and beliefs. So by the teenage years, each of us has constructed
a catalog of aptitudes and mannerisms we are looking for in a mate.
This chart is unique. Even identical twins, who have similar interests and
lifestyles, as well as similar religious, political, and social values, tend to
develop different styles of loving and choose different types of partners.
65 Subtle
differences in their experiences have shaped their romantic tastes.
This idiosyncratic psychological chart is also enormously complex. Some
people seek a partner who will agree with what they say; others like a spirited
debate. Some love a prank; others want predictability, order, or flamboyance.
Some want to be amused; others wish to be intellectually excited. Many need a
partner who will support their causes, quell their fears, or share their goals. And
some choose a partner for the lifestyle they wish to lead. Søren Kierkegaard, the
Danish philosopher, felt that love must be unselfish, filled with devotion for the
beloved. But some are uncomfortable with a doting mate. Instead, they want a
partner to challenge them to grow intellectually or spiritually.
Love maps are subtle and difficult to read. A good example is a friend of
mine who grew up with an alcoholic father. She acclimated to the
unpredictability around the house. But she resolved she would never marry a
man like dear ol’ dad. Indeed, she didn’t. She married an unpredictable, chaotic
artist instead—a match that suited her largely unconscious love map.
“Love looks not with the eyes, but the mind, / And therefore is winged Cupid
painted blind,” wrote Shakespeare.
66 This is probably why it is so difficult to
introduce single friends to one another and why Internet dating services often
fail: matchmakers don’t know the intricacies of their clients’ love templates.
Often men and women don’t know their own love map either.
The Lover’s Psyche
Hundreds of psychologists have tried to understand the dynamics between
romantic partners, and many offer interesting ideas about why we choose one
mate rather than another. I will review just a few.
Psychologists Elaine Hatfield and Richard Rapson believe that adults express
one of six “attachment” styles.
67 “Securely attached” men and women tend to
choose sweethearts they can be close to; they also make and keep friends easily.
“Fickle” people get bored. If they win a lover, they become restless; if their mate
departs, they pursue. Others “cling”; they prefer mates with whom they can
maintain constant contact. “Skittish” types feel pushed and smothered easily;
they like their independence and flee from intimacy and deep attachments.
“Casual” lovers are not willing to invest too much time or energy in loving. They
like dating, but reading, traveling, or working takes precedence over
commitment to a romantic partner. And a small number of men and women are
uninterested in romance; they make no effort to woo or retain a sweetheart.
According to psychologist Ayala Pines, we choose a mate who is similar to
the parent with whom we have unresolved childhood issues; unconsciously we
are seeking to resolve this natal relationship in adulthood.
68 Harville Hendrix
maintains that we choose partners who suffered similar traumas in childhood and
are stuck in this same stage of development.
69 Murray Bowen believes we
choose partners who display the same level of “differentiation” or independence
of identity as ourselves.
70 We are seeking partners with a compatible ability to
handle anxiety. And psychologists Cindy Hazan and Philip Shaver
71 build on the
theories of John Bowlby
72 and Mary Ainsworth,
73 proposing that we fall in love
and form attachments that mirror the type of childhood attachment we made to
our mother, be it “secure,” “anxious-ambivalent,” or avoidant.
Elliot Aronson
74 would adhere to poet Theodore Roethke’s feeling, “Love
begets love.”
75 He maintains that some people choose those they think love
them; this belief initiates a cascade of pleasant experiences that lead to the altar.
Shakespeare’s Beatrice and Benedict are good examples of this; both fell in love
with the other after hearing of the other’s romantic ardor for them. Theodore
Reik believed men and women choose mates who satisfy an important need,
including qualities they lack. As Reik put it, “Tell me whom you love and I will
tell you who you are and, more especially, who you want to be.”
76
There is undoubtedly some truth to all of these ideas. But they all stem from
a fundamental proposition: we each have a unique personality, built by our
childhood experiences and particular biology. And this largely unconscious
psychic structure guides us to fall in love with one person rather than another.
Individual “love maps” probably begin to develop in infancy as we adjust to
countless environmental forces that influence our feelings and ideas. As Maurice
Sendak wisely noted, childhood is “damned serious business.” Then as we enter
school and make new friends, we engage in infatuations that further mold our
likes and dislikes. As we develop more durable love affairs as teenagers, we
continue to expand this personal psychological chart. And as we ride the waves
of life—and experience a few romantic disasters—we trim and enrich this
mental template.
So as you walk into a room of potential mating partners, you carry within
your brain an extraordinary sum of infinitesimal, mostly unconscious biological
and cultural preferences that can spoil or spark romantic passion.
To make matters even more complex, our suitors are, themselves,
enormously varied. Do you know any two people who are alike? I don’t. The
variety of human personalities is remarkable. Some are brilliant musicians;
others can write a touching poem, build a bridge, make the perfect golf shot,
perform Shakespearean roles from memory, deliver witticisms to thousands from
a bandstand, philosophize coherently about the universe, preach effectively on
God or duty, predict economic patterns, or charismatically lead soldiers into
battle. And that’s just the beginning. Nature has provided us with a seemingly
infinite variety of individuals to choose from—even within our social, economic,
and intellectual milieu.
And here is the focal point of this chapter. It is my belief that along with the
evolution of humanity’s outstanding variety came the fundamental mechanism
with which we choose a mate—the brain circuitry for human romantic love.
The Mating Mind
Why are we all so different from one another?
My thinking on this matter stems from Charles Darwin’s fascinating idea of
sexual selection.
Darwin was annoyed by all the ornaments he saw in nature.
77 Crimson ruffs,
blue penises, pendulous breasts, whirling dances, melodious trills, particularly
the peacock’s cumbersome tail feathers: he felt these seemingly superfluous
decorations undermined his theory that all traits evolved for a purpose. As he
complained, “The sight of a feather in a peacock’s tail, whenever I gaze on it,
makes me sick.”
78
But with time Darwin came to believe that all these flashy embellishments
evolved for an important purpose: to attract mates. Those with the finest
courtship displays, he reasoned, attracted more and better mating partners; these
dandies disproportionately bred—and passed along to their descendants these
seemingly useless decorations. He called this process sexual selection.
In a highly original book, The Mating Mind, psychologist Geoffrey Miller
adds to Darwin’s theory of sexual selection. He proposes that human beings have
also evolved extravagant traits to impress potential mating partners.
As Miller reasons, our human intelligence, linguistic talent, and musical
ability, our drive to create visual arts, stories, myths, comedies, and dramas, our
taste for all kinds of sports, our curiosity, our ability to solve complex math
problems, our moral virtue, our religious fervor, our impulse for charitable
giving, our political convictions, sense of humor, need to gossip, creativity, even
our courage, pugnacity, perseverance, and kindness are all far too ornate and
metabolically expensive to have evolved solely to survive another day.
79 Had our
forebears needed these advanced aptitudes simply to live, chimpanzees would
have developed these abilities as well. They didn’t.
Miller believes, therefore, that all these marvelous human capacities evolved
to win the mating game. We are “courtship machines,” Miller writes.
80 Those
ancestors who could speak poetically, draw deftly, dance nimbly, or deliver fiery
moral speeches were regarded as more attractive. These talented men and
women produced more babies. And gradually these human capacities became
inscribed in our genetic code. Moreover, to distinguish themselves, our forebears
specialized—creating the tremendous variety in human personalities seen today.
Miller acknowledges that in their simple forms, many of these traits were
also useful in order to survive on the grasslands of ancient Africa; these talents
had many purposes. But these aptitudes, he believes, became more and more
complex because the opposite sex liked them and chose to mate with verbal,
musical, or otherwise talented men and women. He concludes: “The mind
evolved by moonlight.”
81
I agree with Miller’s thesis. Take language, for example. Our forebears only
needed a few thousand words and simple grammatical constructions to say,
“Here comes the lion” and “Pass the nuts.” But our flowery poetic verse, our
musical brilliance, and many of our other complex human talents probably
evolved, at least in part, as men and women endlessly displayed their mating
qualities.
But how did ancestral men and women come to prefer these extraordinary
traits in their suitors? Some brain mechanism must have simultaneously evolved
in the display choosers to become attracted to the fancy rhymes, lyric tunes, and
other flashy traits that display producers paraded for them.
Darwin offered little comment on how creatures actually respond to these
courtship displays and prefer one mate over another. He believed this selection
process was somehow linked to an appreciation of beauty. Females of all
species, he wrote, were attracted to males who displayed signs of comeliness.
But Darwin could not explain how this female attraction operated in the animal
brain, puzzling, “It is, however, difficult to obtain direct evidence of their
capacity to appreciate beauty.”
82
Miller also notes this dilemma. Along with the evolution of traits in the
human display producer, there must be some corresponding brain mechanisms in
the display chooser to enable them to discriminate among these courtship
signals, prefer some, and select a specific mating partner.
So he suggests that along with the evolution of our superb human mental and
physical abilities came the “mental machinery” or “sexual choice equipment” to
discriminate among and appreciate these wooing ploys. Hence, our forebears
developed a taste for linguistic flair, for artistic drawings in the sand, for
charismatic oratory, moral strength, and many other budding human talents—as
well as the aptitudes to discriminate, remember, and judge these courtship cues.
But Miller offers no concrete suggestion as to what actually enables the
display chooser to choose one wooing tactic rather than another, saying only that
it is something like “a big pleasure meter” in the brain and that endorphins (the
brain’s natural painkillers) might be involved.
I propose that this pleasure meter is the brain circuitry for romantic love—
orchestrated largely by dopamine networks through the caudate nucleus and
other reward pathways in the brain. As ancestral men and women sifted through
their array of mating opportunities, the primordial brain circuitry for animal
attraction evolved into human romantic love—to help the chooser choose a
specific mating partner, pursue this beloved avidly, and devote his/her courtship
time and energy to this reproductive prize.
When and where and why did our forebears begin to need complex language
abilities and myriad other astounding talents to win a mate? Chimpanzees don’t
need poetry or guitar music to bed a lover. What triggered the evolution of these
myriad special human talents and the brain circuitry to be wildly drawn to one
rather than another: romantic love?
It all began, as Dryden put it, “when wild in wood the noble savage ran.”

Why We Love: The Evolution of Romantic Love
The fountains mingle with the river,
And the rivers with the ocean;
The winds of heaven mix forever,
With a sweet emotion;
Nothing in the world is single;
All things by a law divine
In one another’s being mingle:—
Why not I with thine?
Percy Bysshe Shelley
“Love’s Philosophy”
“I seem to have loved you in numberless forms numberless times, In life after
life, in age after age forever … Today it is heaped at your feet, it has found its
end in you, / The love of all man’s days both past and forever.” Indian poet
Rabindranath Tagore sensed that his passion for a woman had come across the
eons from a mind built long ago. Indeed, we carry embedded in our brains the
whole history of our species, all the circuits that our forebears built as they sang
and danced and shared their wisdom and their food to impress their lovers and
their friends, then passionately fell in love with “him” or “her.”
How did we come to court and love the way we do? Bad Bull didn’t shower
Tia with poetry to prove he was king of elephants. Skipper found his little beaver
mate one spring evening; he didn’t sing rock ’n’ roll songs to a thousand
assembled female beavers to impress them first. Misha fell in love with Maria
the moment Maria wagged her doggy tail and invited him to play. All animals
have mating preferences. And most have evolved courtship plumage of one kind
or another to dazzle their would-be lovers. But no creatures except human beings
parade about with such extravagant displays as sonnets and skydiving.
As psychologist Geoffrey Miller argues, many of our exceptional human
traits, such as our ornate language skills, our affinity for all kinds of sports, our
religious fervor, our humor and moral virtue, are too ornate, too metabolically
expensive, and too useless in the struggle for existence to have evolved merely
so we could survive another day. They must have emerged, at least in part, to
help us court and win the mating game.
Moreover, I have proposed that along with all the magnificent courtship
ornaments that we flaunt to persuade prospective mates, men and women have
also evolved a specific brain network to respond to these traits: the circuitry for
romantic love. This passion, a developed form of animal attraction, emerged to
drive each of us to choose from among these myriad courtship displays, prefer a
specific individual, and begin the primordial mating dance exclusively with
“him” or “her.”
But Miller never tells us when, where, or why human beings evolved these
special talents. And I have not explained how our species transformed from
creatures who felt a temporary attraction for a “special” individual into men and
women who are willing to die for “him” or “her.” Something happened deep in
time to produce the human drive to love.
Love in the Trees
Palm trees, fig trees, wild pear trees, mahogany trees, evergreen trees, trees,
trees, and more trees carpeted East Africa 8 million years ago. Here lived the last
of our forest-dwelling ancestors. Anthropologists have little direct evidence of
their daily lives. But our first forebears probably lived much as modern
chimpanzees do. We share over 98 percent of our DNA with these creatures.
“Common” chimps and their smaller chimp relatives called bonobos still live in
what is left of that primal African environment. And chimps display many traits
that our common ancestor most likely shared.
Like today’s common chimps and bonobos, our first forebears must have
lived in communities, often consisting of eighty to a hundred males and females.
They slept high in the forest canopy, arose after dawn, and descended to the
jungle floor to wander well-worn trails in their mutual home range. Members
must have met and mixed singly or in small parties, eating and socializing
intensely. These human ancestors knew who was family, friend, and foe. And
they chattered among themselves with at least fifty different kinds of hoots and
barks, as well as with about thirty varied gestures.
Like today’s chimps, they probably used stone hammers to crack nuts,
toothpicks made of twigs, and napkins from wadded grass. Like chimps they
probably hurled rocks and sticks to spar for dominance, hunted monkeys, shared
the meat, and made war on chimp neighbors to usurp their lands. Some were
pranksters, some leaders; others brave, deceptive, curious, or belligerent. And
many made friends and enemies, gave twigs as gifts, defended comrades in
spats, and lingered near dying relatives.
They also made love. Today’s chimps and bonobos are among the most
sexually active animals on earth. They kiss—sometimes with the deep “French
kiss,” walk arm in arm, hug, stroke, pat, groom, bow to one another, and often
copulate throughout most (if not all) of the female’s monthly estrus cycle. But
unlike human beings, our last tree-dwelling forebears were almost certainly
promiscuous—just as chimpanzees and bonobos are today.
At the height of estrus, an ancestral female may have joined a single male
and left the community to copulate with him in private. But this bond was
temporary; most likely they never paired for more than a few days or weeks.
Nor did they fall in love. Undoubtedly our first relatives had “favorites,” like
all other creatures. But these distant kin showed none of the obsessive focus on a
single mate that is so characteristic of human romantic passion. And they
probably never formed a partnership to rear their young. A mother didn’t need a
mate to help protect or provide for her and her child. So like chimps, mothers
raised their infants by themselves.
Nevertheless, some of our forest-dwelling ancestors must have felt more
attraction for a mating partner than others did, an affinity that would eventually
develop into human romantic love. When, where, and why humanity started to
love with new vigor, no one knows. But I think this journey began soon after our
forebears began to descend from the trees of East Africa to build a new world on
the perilous ground.
The Human Stride
The earliest hominid fossils come from northern Chad. In 2002, anthropologists
reported finding an almost complete skull as well as several jaws and teeth in
this Central African country.
1
Some ancient kin lived here, near a shallow, freshwater lake, between 6 and 7
million years ago. They may have spent most of their days in the trees that
crowded along the shore. Some must have also ventured into the open plains,
sticking close to ribbons of forest that wove through the prairie grass. Perhaps
they followed vultures to the half-consumed carcass of an eland or wildebeest.
Maybe the bravest hurled sticks and stones at feeding lions, then stole their
dinner. Some must have waded into the swampy deep as well, steering clear of
dunking hippos to seize a turtle or corner a gazelle that came to drink.
We know little about these relatives. Their bones don’t even tell us whether
they walked on two feet or four. But “Toumai,” as the local people call the Chad
skull, was part of our human lineage. True, his brain was no bigger than a
chimp’s. But he had a flatter face, a more human jaw, and more human teeth.
And he and his relatives clearly courted, copulated, and bred.
Their children bred; their children’s children’s children also bred. Because by
3.5 million years ago many more hominids were roaming the gladed forests and
the more open woodlands and savannahs that stretched across East Africa.
Anthropologists have found hundreds of their fossilized bones and teeth. These
folks had changed. Their feet, legs, hips, and skulls bespeak men and women
who walked erect, on two feet instead of four.
I sing the human stride. As we balance our neck and spine above our hips,
extend the leg, lock the knee, hit the ground with the heel, then roll onto the ball
of the foot and spring off with the big toe, we almost effortlessly fall forward.
This single innovation would change much of life on earth. With walking,
our ancestors could carry stones to throw at leopards or lions that stalked them in
the dark. With walking, they could carry sticks to dig for roots and tubers. With
walking, they could hurl rocks at small animals that nestled in the grass.
Bipedalism also liberated their hands for gesturing and freed their mouths for
words. With walking, collecting, and carrying, our forebears began their
uncharted march toward modernity.
All this is fact. Now for theory. I think the human stride caused a problem for
females: they became obliged to carry their babies in their arms instead of on
their backs. In the trees, their quadrupedal chimplike ancestors had carried their
infants on their backs. In that leafy universe a mother’s hands were free to gather
fruits and vegetables. And she could easily dash from predators to safe places
high above the ground. But as our forebears began to walk along the ground
beneath the trees and out onto the open plains, as well as carry sticks and stones
to harvest dinner, I think females became overburdened.
How could a young mother dig for roots and catch small animals with one
arm while she carried a squirming, twenty-pound infant in the other? How could
she sprint away from hungry lions that licked their chops as she toted armloads
of bulky things? I believe these early females began to need mates to help feed
and protect them—at least while they carried and nursed a child.
As pair-bonding became essential to females, it became suitable to males.
How could a male protect and provide for a harem of females? Even if he
succeeded in attracting a flock of women, other males would join his group to
woo them, perhaps even steal away with one or more. But a male could
provision and safeguard a single female and their nursing child.
So as our forebears adopted life on the dangerous ground, pair-bonding
became imperative for females and practical for males. And monogamy—the
human habit of forming a pair-bond with one individual at a time—evolved.
2
We have some evidence that monogamy evolved long ago. Recently the
bones of men and women living some 3.5 million years ago and known as
Australopithecus afarensis were remeasured for skeletal size. As it turns out,
males were somewhat larger than females; in fact the sexes varied from each
other in roughly the same proportions that modern men and women vary.
Anthropologists regularly use size differences between the sexes of a species to
gauge what sort of social group they lived in. And this size difference suggests
these early relatives lived in the same sort of social units we do today: they were
“principally monogamous.”
3
Scientists have even found genetic evidence of ancestral monogamy.
Remember prairie voles, those mouselike creatures that form pair-bonds soon
after puberty and settle into a lifetime of burrowing with a spouse?
Neuroscientist Tom Insel and his colleagues discovered in these animals an extra
bit of DNA in the gene that controls for the distribution of vasopressin receptors
in the brain, a bit of DNA not present in their promiscuous, asocial cousins,
montane voles. These scientists took this tiny piece of DNA out of prairie voles
and inserted it into some highly promiscuous male mice. Sure enough, these
mice began to form close monogamous relationships with particular females.
4
Humans have a similar gene that codes for the activities of vasopressin. And
some people (but not all) carry this same extra bit of DNA on this gene.
5
Someday we will know exactly what this genetic region does in people and why
some carry it and others don’t. For the moment we can say this: long, long ago
humanity must have needed to pair up to rear their young—because at least one
gene that codes for monogamous behaviors is embedded in our DNA.
“Two are better than one,” the Bible says.
6
I think our forebears understood
this aphorism more than 3.5 million years ago.
Evolution of Divorce
But I don’t see why these primordial pair-bonds needed to be permanent.
Everywhere in the world where people are permitted to divorce (and
economically can divorce), many do. If you ask them why they terminate a
union, each gives a different reason. Yet human parting has some patterns—and
some of this blueprint appears to have evolved in the cradle of humankind.
I arrived at this conclusion while I was gathering divorce data on fifty-eight
diverse human societies recorded in the Demographic Yearbooks of the United
Nations.
7
I found several surprising worldwide patterns to human separation.
There were many exceptions, of course. But as a rule, couples around the world
who divorced, tended to part during and around the fourth year of marriage, in
their middle twenties and/or with a single dependent child.
At first these patterns were meaningless to me. But as I read about the mating
habits of other creatures, I began to see some uncanny parallels.
Only 3 percent of mammals pair up to rear their young; humans are among
them; but this habit only occurs under special circumstances. Among these:
female mammals form a pair-bond when they cannot rear their infants by
themselves.
Such are foxes. The dog fox and the vixen form a pair-bond in mid-February,
build several dens, and rear their kits together. They do this because the female
bears as many as five exceedingly helpless kits; they are born blind and deaf.
And the female’s milk is so thin that she must remain in the den almost
constantly to feed her young. She will starve unless someone feeds her. So she
and a “special” friend form a pair-bond and rear their young together. As the kits
wander from the den in high summer, however, parents depart—separately. Their
work is done. Next year the couple may reunite; more likely each will take a
different mate.
Serial monogamy is common among our feathered friends. The robins that
grace our parks each spring pair up for the breeding season. They, too, must
divide their duties. Someone must incubate the eggs, then protect the chicks; the
other must provide dinner for the family. Successful couples raise several
broods. But when the last of the fledglings wing away, parents part. Next year,
many will take new spouses.
So, in those species that pair up to rear their babies, many remain together
only long enough to raise the young through infancy.
This principle also seems to apply to people. In traditional societies, the
lifeway of habitual exercise, a lean diet, and low body weight coupled with the
habit of nursing an infant for extended periods around the clock inhibits regular
ovulation for several years after childbirth. Among these societies are the !Kung
Bushmen of southern Africa, the Australian Aborigines, the Gainj of New
Guinea, the Yanomamo of Amazonia, and the Netsilik Eskimos; women in these
cultures tend to bear their young about four years apart. As a result,
anthropologists think that four-year birth intervals were the regular pattern of
birth spacing during our long human prehistory.
8
Thus the duration of human birth spacing is similar to the general duration of
worldwide marriages that end in divorce.
So here’s my theory: perhaps like robins, foxes, and many other serially
monogamous creatures, ancestral humans living some 3.5 million years ago
paired with a mate only long enough to rear a single child through infancy—
about four years.
9 When a mother no longer needed to nurse or carry an infant
constantly and could deposit her baby with grandmother, aunts, sisters, cousins,
and older youngsters while she gathered food, she no longer needed a full-time
partner to ensure the survival of her child. Indeed she could “divorce” a mate if
she found a new man more to her liking. Primitive divorce even had genetic
payoffs: men and women who “remarried” could bear young with a different
partner—creating beneficial variety in their lineages.
“Trouble is only opportunity in working clothes,” wrote industrialist Henry J.
Kaiser. As serial monogamy evolved over countless generations, I think this
habitual human practice selected for the brain circuitry for short-term
attachment. Along with this remarkable innovation came our human concepts of
the “father,” the “husband,” and the nuclear family, our human tendency to
become restless in long relationships, and our human penchant to depart a
relationship and pair again: serial monogamy.
But did this primitive tendency to form short-term partnerships spark the
development of human romantic love?
Perhaps it did. Perhaps the attraction that chimps and other creatures feel for
a “special” mating partner became more intense and enduring as primitive men
and women began to pair up to rear infants as a team. Then as this attraction
slowly ebbed, feelings of intense attachment grew. When their child toddled out
of infancy, however, I think many couples began to seek fresh love. A few
parents may have remained together to have more children; many others sought
new romance—unconsciously driven to bear more varied young.
But the courtship process must have been rather simple some 3.5 million
years ago. I say this because these australopithecines had a cranial capacity of
some 420 cubic centimeters, only slightly larger than the average cranial
capacity of chimps. And impressions left by brain tissue on the inside of these
fossil skulls indicate that the regions for human language had not begun to grow.
They did not speak in human ways. Moreover, these forebears left no drawings
on rock walls, no homemade flutes or drums. They didn’t even make flint knives
or any other kinds of stone tools for hunting—a hallmark of humankind. Our
forebears had not developed the linguistic flair or other courtship tools humanity
would come to flaunt. And it was in tandem with the evolution of all these
magnificent human talents for wooing that I think human romantic love would
bloom.
To court, these australopithecine forebears must have depended on their
status in the group, their chimplike wits and charm. They probably felt deep
attraction to a mate, even remained attached to a mating partner for a few years.
But many went on to court and love anew.
“O Brave New World”
The brave new world of humanness that Miranda wondered at in Shakespeare’s
The Tempest started to appear some 2 million years ago. New people had begun
to wander the open plains of what is today Kenya and Tanzania—Homo habilis,
or handy man.
Archaeologists have found heaps of their unfinished stone tools scattered
across the plains of East Africa.
10 Generation after generation of Homo habilis
peoples must have come to these quarry sites to make hammerstones, knives,
anvils, and other tools, leaving behind slivers of flint and lumps of unfinished
lava, obsidian, quartzite, and limestone. They weren’t highly skilled. They only
whacked off one or two sides of rocks to create a sharpened edge or point. But
these implements were far superior to those made by any other creature living at
the time.
Our habilis forebears also assembled at what appear to be meat-processing
places. Here they lugged huge hunks of hunted game, then sat and stripped the
bones of meat, removed the marrow and the fat, and shared and ate. Some
twenty-five hundred tools and animal bones were found in these ancient garbage
dumps. These ancestors evidently hunted an assortment of large animals, too.
Primitive zebras, horses, pigs, monkeys, gazelles, and many other types of
antelope were their prey. And because these animals are too big to be consumed
alone, our kin must have shared their spoils according to social rules.
They also left what could be evidence of romantic love.
Some of these hunters left dozens of stone tools around a fallen elephant. All
its bones remain except its tusks and toes. Did they remove these appendages to
use as amulets for luck in hunting—or in love? Did these hunters give away
these trophies to impress “special” girls instead?
I suggest these possibilities because these people were getting smarter. One
Homo habilis individual who lived some 1.8 million years ago in what is now
the badlands of Koobi Fora, Kenya, had a brain capacity of some 775 cubic
centimeters. His friends and neighbors had an average cranial capacity of some
630 cubic centimeters. Equally remarkable, one skull dated 1.8 million years ago
had an indentation on its inner side to accommodate a brain region we now call
Broca’s area. Humans use this brain region to form words and produce the
sounds of human language.
Talking. There have been so many different theories on the evolution of
human language that as long ago as 1866 the Linguistic Society of Paris
announced it would accept no more articles on this topic. That declaration has
deterred almost no one since. I won’t offer another elaborate theory.
Nevertheless, as Broca’s area started to take a human shape by 1.8 million years
ago, it seems reasonable to believe that some of our forebears were beginning to
speak with some sort of primitive human tongue.
One can certainly see many purposes for language. With meaningless noises
arranged and rearranged to make words, with words strung grammatically
together to make sentences, Homo habilis men and women could frame
arguments, strike deals, support leaders, dupe foes, teach skills, scold cheaters,
spread news, set rules, stop tears, define kin, placate gods, and recall events that
occurred years ago.
The first human conversations were probably about the weather. I say this
because I am constantly amazed at how earnestly and repeatedly people
converse on this matter. Unquestionably our forebears also discussed which way
the zebras went, the cliffs where the baboons congregate at dusk, the ripe melons
near the canyon edge, and why Mara’s little baby cries at night. They probably
expressed hundreds of other thoughts and feelings about today, yesterday, and
tomorrow.
But with words they could also woo. Men and women could tell clever
stories, chant sexy tunes, and entice would-be lovers with insightful thoughts.
With words, our forebears could flatter, tempt, and tease. They could gossip,
reminisce, and whisper with a beloved, too. As primitive human language
gradually emerged, our forebears must have begun our endless human chat
about, and with, “him” and “her.”
It is at this general time in human evolution that I feel the brain circuitry for
animal attraction developed into its human form: romantic love. I propose this
for a series of related reasons.
Nariokotome Boy
A boy died. His bones sank into the mud of a swamp some 1.6 million years ago
in what today is Kenya. In 1984, paleoanthropologists retrieved almost all of his
fossilized remains.
11 When they reassembled his bones and teeth, they gazed
upon a child who was somewhere between the ages of eight and twelve. He
looked unnervingly like you and me.
Nariokotome Boy, as anthropologists call this stunning fossil find, might
have stood over six feet tall had he lived to adulthood. His hands, arms, hips, and
legs were similar to ours. In fact, had he worn a mask, he could have walked
along any street today without notice. Had he removed his headgear, however,
we would have gasped. Nariokotome Boy had thick brow ridges above his eyes.
His forehead was low and sloped. His face protruded. His teeth were big. And he
had no chin.
Yet he and his Homo erectus relatives had evolved in many ways. These
people made fancy tools, known as Acheulean hand axes. Some were almondshaped, others looked like a pear or teardrop; many were seventeen inches from
tapered tip to rounded butt; and all were well balanced and quite symmetrical.
These folk had conventions for making tools and weapons. And they left
thousands of their streamlined hand axes, as well as an enormous variety of
cleavers, picks, and knives, along the bogs, marshes, lakes, streams, and rivers of
East Africa. They were hunters.
They felled huge creatures, too. They left hundreds of tools around the
skeletons of hippos, elephants, buffalo, and zebras. To track, surround, and kill
these beasts, they needed acute spatial skills. To parcel out their booty, they
needed memory of their obligations and advanced linguistic skills. To appease,
impress, coordinate, and cooperate as a group they must have needed humor,
compassion, and many other executive social skills as well. Homo erectus men
and women were becoming human.
Nariokotome Boy and his relatives also harnessed fire.
Not the computer, the printing press, the steam engine, or the wheel would
transform humanity as did this basic technological development: controlling
flame.
With fire they could harden points on spears, smoke small mammals from
their burrows, drive elephants into bogs, steal a lion’s supper, and frighten all
sorts of creatures from their caves—and then move in. The sick, the young, the
old could lounge in camp. They were able to maintain a camp. And they could
extend the day into the night, talk around the flame, and sleep in its protective
glow. Unchained from the circadian rhythms of all other animals, these forebears
had time to sing and dance, propitiate unknown forces, mull over yesterday,
decide about tomorrow—and explore beyond the horizon to the north.
Explore they did. Carrying burning embers, our Homo erectus ancestors
moved out of Africa to explore colder climes, in part because they could. Some
1.8 million years ago the earth’s temperature plunged, beginning the Glacial
Ages. Periodically mountains of ice would suck up ocean waters and the world
sea level would drop over three hundred feet, leaving wide land highways out of
Africa. The big herd animals headed north to pastures fresh and new. Homo
erectus families followed—leaving their bones and tools in far-flung Europe,
China, and Java more than a million years ago.
Brain Power
Of all the gifts bestowed by flame, however, perhaps the most remarkable was
humankind’s new ability to cook food. I think this innovation contributed
considerably to the evolution of human romantic love.
Cooking meat hastens the release of amino acids that aid digestion.
12
Cooking vegetables destroys toxins. And cooking any food devastates
microorganisms that can take up residence in the gut and kill. Cooking helped
Nariokotome Boy and his relatives survive and thrive.
But cooking also spurred the evolution of the human brain, for an interesting
reason. Animals must expend a great deal of metabolic energy to build and
maintain their heart, liver, kidneys, stomach, and intestines. They must expend
even more energy to build and feed their brain. So animals must allocate their
resources. And because creatures that eat mainly leaves must devote a huge
amount of energy to their digestive organs, they cannot support a complex brain
as well.
13 Those who eat meat, however, have extra fuel to allot to brain power.
Homo erectus did just that. Nariokotome Boy had a cranial capacity of
approximately 880 cubic centimeters. And some of his relatives had brain
volumes as big as 1,000 cubic centimeters, not too much smaller than the
modern human cranial capacity of about 1,325 cubic centimeters.
What an investment. While the human brain is only 2 percent of our body
weight, it consumes 25 percent of our metabolic energy and 40 percent of our
blood glucose as food. Thousands of genes, indeed one-third of our genome,
direct its development. During their first year infants spend 50 percent of their
metabolic energy just constructing and refining brain mechanisms.
14 Moreover,
the slightest mistake in these processes can seriously impair brain function. So
the evolving Homo erectus brain was exceedingly costly, as well as highly
vulnerable to mutations and poor engineering.
This magnificent organ must have served crucial purposes: among them may
have been to impress potential mating partners with new types of linguistic,
artistic, moralistic, or other forms of seductive flair.
Bigger brains would cause trouble for women, however—an obstetrical
dilemma that I believe spurred the evolution of romantic love.
The Obstetrical Dilemma
How could Homo erectus women bear bigheaded babies through their little birth
canals? The size of the human pelvis must retain its basic shape to enable upright
walking. So as the infant’s head increased in size, ancestral women became
obliged to deliver their infants in an earlier state of development.
Anthropologists think this “obstetrical dilemma” began to occur by the time the
adult human cranial capacity had reached about 800 cubic centimeters—during
Homo erectus times.
Many women must have died as they tried to deliver their bigheaded young.
But nature likes variety, and some fortunate females must have been able to give
birth to their infants in an earlier stage of growth. These babies lived. And
rapidly our forebears evolved a hallmark of our species: exceedingly helpless,
undeveloped infants.
With this remarkable evolutionary development, Homo erectus women must
have felt overwhelmed by the job of parenting.
To make matters worse for mothers, childhood almost doubled. Chimpanzees
complete puberty around age ten; we humans don’t complete our growth until
around age eighteen. And unlike chimps who begin to feed themselves around
age four, human children depend on adults until the late teenage years. This
phenomenon is known as “delayed maturation.” Anthropologists believe it first
developed in Homo erectus times.
15
What a burden—small, weak, needy infants who often remained boisterous,
willful, unskilled, and hungry for almost twenty years.
With the origin of big-game hunting, fancy tools and weapons, the
harnessing of fire, our growing brains, our tiny helpless babies, our long
teenagehood, and our march from Africa into chilly, dangerous northern worlds,
our ancestors must have felt intense pressure to find mates they could live with
for longer periods of time. Parenting had become far too much for one.
With these developments I believe courtship intensified. Individuals needed
to distinguish themselves in new and special ways to attract mates with whom
they were genuinely compatible. Men and women had already begun to develop
a modicum of verbal ability, artistic verve, humor, inventiveness, courage, and
many other human gifts in order to survive on the open plains, as well as the
brain circuitry to appreciate these skills in others. Now suitors increasingly used
these talents to display their usefulness and good genes to potential lovers, too.
Those being wooed responded, due to their preexisting preference for these
skills.
16
With this greater need to seek and choose a long-term partner, I think the
brain circuitry for human romantic love emerged.
Evolution of Human Romantic Love
The process was probably rather simple. A million years ago, some ancestors
excelled at clever remarks or charismatic speeches; others were good at athletic
feats. The forerunners of our modern journalists kept track of the group’s doings;
they impressed potential mates with news and gossip. The first poets charmed
their admirers with rhythmic tales. The ancestors of Rembrandt and Matisse
drew better pictures in the dirt. And the forerunners of our rock stars and opera
divas swayed potential lovers by singing tribal myths. Some cured the sick.
Some communed with the spirits of the wind and night. Some were daring; some
extraordinarily generous. Others made their sweethearts laugh. “When a man
makes her laugh, a woman feels protected,” wrote Ugo Betti. Homo erectus
women must have adored witty fellows—and joined them in the bushes on idle
afternoons.
In those demanding days of yesteryear, our forebears came to need more and
more special talents to entice potential mates into long-term partnerships. Those
who excelled at complex forms of language, art, or song survived and bred—
passing these and many other exquisite human talents along to us. But each man
and woman “advertised within their budget,” because each had a limited amount
of metabolic energy and brain circuitry to expend.
17 Suitors therefore specialized
—and displayed their special wares to catch a mate.
This courting process continues. Einstein once asserted that “a person who
has not made his great contribution to science before the age of 30 will never do
so.” Although all of us can list men and women who excelled later in life, Dr.
Satoshi Kanazawa of the London School of Economics recently confirmed
Einstein’s statement and offered a Darwinian explanation. After studying 280
great male scientists, he confirmed that 65 percent of them made their biggest
discoveries before age thirty-five. He also noted that most lost their creative
drive after a few years of marriage. Kanazawa concludes that these young
geniuses were “seeking to impress women with their virtuosity.”
18
I think young Homo erectus men (and women) were seeking to impress
potential mates with their virtuosity more than a million years ago.
More important to our story: as suitors displayed their various special talents,
those viewing these courtship ploys began to need advanced reasoning,
judgment, insight, memory, awareness, consciousness, self-consciousness, and
many other sophisticated brain mechanisms to distinguish among courters.
They also needed the brain circuitry to appreciate these courtship displays.
They needed to relish morality, admire religious fervor, treasure novelty, esteem
clever poems and touching rhythms, delight in good conversation, cherish
honesty, applaud determination, and value myriad other aptitudes. They had to
evolve the brain power to detect fakers. And they surely needed to develop brain
mechanisms to decipher what potential lovers were thinking. Called “theory of
mind,” this ability to understand the mental states of others, their desires and
intentions,
19
is particularly well developed in humans. Homo erectus men and
women needed the mental machinery to assess personality and accomplishment
in order to appraise and value their suitors a million years ago.
They also needed a mighty biological urge to drive them to focus their
courtship energy on a specific mating partner, an urge so potent they would be
willing to make a long-term commitment to this special individual, even die for
“him” or “her.”
“What does not destroy me, makes me strong,” wrote Friedrich Nietzsche.
Among Homo erectus people, the vicissitudes of childbirth and delayed
maturation spurred the need for long-term pair-bonds and greater courtship
ingenuity. And this courtship pressure gave rise to our extraordinarily fancy
human aptitudes, our human mental machinery to appreciate these talents, and
the brain circuitry for romantic love—the passion to drive the “courter” and the
“courted” to make a deep commitment to rear their young together for years and
years.
“O, I willingly stake all for you,” declared Walt Whitman. Men and women
needed to say these words over a million years ago.
The Mind Evolved by Daylight
Of course, our Homo erectus forebears had other vital reasons to develop
uniquely human capacities. Nariokotome Boy and his relatives needed to feel
empathy for a wounded comrade, patience for a cranky child, understanding for
a disgruntled teen, and to develop the social graces to get along with
obstreperous or pompous members of the group. They were a band. They had to
move together through the grass, a killing field for predators. So those who
could perceive dangers, remember past calamities, devise strategies, articulate
choices, make decisions, judge distances, foresee obstacles, and persuade
comrades with convincing postures and compelling words disproportionately
survived. The human mind evolved by daylight.
But after dark they must have assembled around the firelight to roast their
meat, sharpen spears, rock their cooing infants, and imitate the ostrich, hog, or
panther as the old folks slept. They must have sung of courage, fortitude, and
conquest, leapt and wrestled to show endurance, wept to show compassion, and
clowned to parade their wit. Many also slipped away to cuddle. By moonlight,
our outstanding aptitudes also took their human shape.
Marching toward Modernity
As time passed, our forebears left increasing evidence of their courting life. By
500,000 years ago, someone in what is now Ethiopia had a brain volume of
roughly 1,300 cubic centimeters, within the modern human range. He or she
certainly had a complex brain—and a mind capable of passionate romantic love.
About 250,000 years ago, a man living in what we know as England
meticulously chipped a symmetrical hand axe around a fossil shell he had found
embedded in a lump of flint. Perhaps it was a gift to a beloved or an
advertisement to show a lover his tool-making prowess. In fact, scientists now
maintain that the huge seventeen-inch hand axes our forebears chipped for over a
million years were too big to serve on the hunt or to gather vegetables or roots.
Because many are unwieldy and meticulously fashioned, they may well have
been used to impress and woo.
20
Sixty thousand years ago people living in the Zagros Mountains of
northeastern Iraq buried someone in a shallow grave one June day and covered
the corpse with hollyhocks, grape hyacinth, bachelor’s buttons, and yellow
flowering groundsel. Perhaps one of them yearned to see a beloved one in an
afterlife. At this same time, someone in France scraped lumps of hematite and
manganese to make earthy red and gray-white powders. With these, a woman
may have decorated her hips and breasts for a summer dance.
By thirty thousand years ago, Cro-Magnon people sported totally modern
human skulls, as well as brains like yours and mine. Now they would decorate
just about everything they touched. Skilled artists descended into huge caverns
beneath France and Spain to draw magnificent bulls, reindeer, ibexes, rhinos,
lions, bears, and magical beasts on dank cave walls. These black, red, and yellow
creatures pound along these grottos with such vigor they almost come alive.
Breaking the utter silence of these vaults, musicians played flutes and drums.
Hundreds stenciled their handprints on craggy walls. Sculptors left behind small
bison of fired clay. And footprints in some caverns still tell of those who danced
in the flickering light of oil lamps.
From Europe to Siberia, people also carved grotesquely buxom, faceless
female fertility symbols out of stone, as well as realistic figurines of women they
must have known. Hunters engraved the handles of ivory tools with graceful
horses. And men and women bedecked themselves with beads, bracelets, and
probably tattoos, as well as caps, headbands, and gowns. Wall paintings even
suggest that women coiffed their hair.
Then by four thousand years ago, someone in ancient Sumeria wrote the first
love letter ever found, inscribed in cuneiform on a fist-sized piece of clay. Today
it sits in the Museum of the Ancient Orient in Istanbul, Turkey, a postcard from
the past. This person loved. He or she felt the same rapture that lovers felt a
million years before.
The Human Capacity to Love
I once believed that Skipper, Maria, Tia, and the rest of the animals who have
become enamored of their mating partners feel the same sensations that you and
I feel when we fall in love. I reasoned that as our ancestors got smarter,
humanity simply embroidered this animal magnetism with a host of cultural
traditions and beliefs. I have changed my mind. What convinced me that the
human experience of romantic love is far more complex—and more intense—is
the impressive brain architecture that generates our intellect and feelings.
“The brain is my second favorite organ,” Woody Allen reportedly joked. Had
Woody thought carefully about the abilities of the human brain, he might have
made it number one. We are so much smarter, so much funnier, so much more
mechanically adept, artistic, spiritual, inventive, altruistic—and sexy—than any
other animal that if you could somehow combine all the mental capacities of all
nonhuman creatures, they would not equal the capabilities of a seven-year-old
human child.
I think the mental equipment that produces these human talents also creates
in humanity a greater capacity for romantic love.
To begin with, the higher primates have larger brains than most mammals,
relative to body size. The human cerebral cortex (the outer rind with which we
do our thinking and recognize our feelings) is almost three times bigger than that
of the apes—gorillas, chimps, and orangutans.
21 The human brain is heavier, too.
The chimp brain weighs about one pound while the human brain weighs three.
22
And size counts. Paul M. Thompson of the University of California, Los
Angeles, has shown that the number of gray cells in the frontal lobes is
significantly linked to intelligence.
23
The human brain is also more complex. The number of nerve connections
between specific brain regions has increased significantly over that of the apes.
24
We even have more genes to build and maintain the brain. Humans have about
thirty-three thousand genes. About one-third of them construct and sustain brain
functions. And although we don’t have many more genes than apes, just a few
hundred extra can make a qualitative difference in how the brain operates
because genes interact—exponentially increasing the number of possible
combinations. Known as the “combinatorial explosion,” at some point our
forebears acquired a few more genes and thus much more machinery to build
and operate an elaborate brain. Some of our genes even work faster than those of
our closest kin.
25
Not only is the human brain generally bigger and more complex, but almost
all of its specific regions have expanded.
For example, the prefrontal cortex, the collection of brain parts that reside
directly behind your forehead, is twice as large as that of other primates (see
diagram here).
26
It is more convoluted, too,
27 with a cortical folding that provides
extra space for thinking. These regions are central to “general intelligence.”
28
Here we assemble facts, reason, weigh options, exercise forethought, generate
insights, make decisions, solve problems, learn from experience, and plan ahead.
We also add meaning and emotional value to our thoughts, assess our risks, and
monitor the acquisition of rewards.
With this remarkable brain region, the prefrontal cortex, humans have
infinitely more capacity to think about “him” or “her.”
Our human brains also enable us to feel intensely. Frankly, I have long
thought that nature overdid it when it comes to human emotions. We “feel” too
much. Now I know why. The human amygdala, an almond-shaped region on the
side of the head beneath the cortex, is more than twice the size of the amygdala
in apes.
29 This brain region plays a central role in generating fear, rage, aversion,
and aggression; parts produce pleasure, too. With this brain capacity for
generating strong, often violent emotions, we humans have the ability to link our
drive to love with an enormous collection of feelings.
We are also uniquely endowed to remember “him” or “her.” “Memory, of all
the powers of the mind, is the most delicate and frail,” wrote Ben Jonson. ’Tis
true. Just try to memorize a long poem or remember what you ate a week ago
today. To help us remember, however, nature contrived to make our
hippocampus, the brain region we use to produce and store memories, almost
twice as big as that of the great apes.
30 This brain region exquisitely recalls the
feelings that accompany memories as well. With this remarkable factory and
storage bin, the hippocampus, we humans are able to recollect the smallest
details about “him” or “her.”
But of all the brain parts that evolved to intensify the experience of romance,
undoubtedly the most important is the human caudate nucleus. As you may
remember, the caudate became active as our lovesick subjects gazed at the
photos of their beloveds. This brain region is associated with focussed attention
and intense motivation to win rewards. And it is twice as large in humans as in
our closest kin.
31 As the caudate enlarged among our Homo erectus ancestors, it
may have intensified the urge to seek and win a sweetheart.
Exactly when a primitive form of animal magnetism finally evolved into
human romantic love—with all its complex thoughts and feelings—no one
knows. But many scientists now think that all parts of the human brain (except
the cerebellum) expanded in unison.
32 We know when this began: some 2 million
years ago. A million years ago, Homo erectus peoples had considerably larger
brains. By 250,000 years ago, some of our Homo sapien ancestors had skulls as
big as yours and mine. And by 35,000 years ago, their brains had taken our
modern shape.
Humanity had emerged from its jungle crucible. Someday we may lift off
from Earth entirely and soar toward the stars. These voyagers will carry in their
heads exquisite mental machinery born on the grass of ancient Africa over a
million years ago. Among these special talents will be our wit, our flair for
poetry, the arts, and drama, a charitable spirit, and many other courting traits,
including the astonishing human ability to fall head-over-heels in love.
Capricious Love
“But I am tied to very thee By every thought I have; thy face I only care to see, /
Thy heart I only crave.”
33
In the mid-1600s, Sir Charles Sedley vividly expressed
this intense drive to love another. But alas, this feeling isn’t always joyful.
As you know, romantic love does not necessarily go hand in hand with the
urge to attach to a mating partner over a long period. You can fall in love with
someone from a different walk of life whom you never wish to marry. And you
can feel romantic passion for one person while you feel deeply attached to
another, usually a spouse. Moreover, you can have sex with someone for whom
you feel no romantic love, even feel romantic passion for one individual while
you copulate with another. What madness—to be socially or sexually entwined
with one person and wildly in love with someone else.
Why has the brain circuitry of romantic love become unlinked from feelings
of lust and long-term attachment?
I think love’s capriciousness is part of nature’s plan. If a Homo erectus man
had one wife and two children and meanwhile fell in love with a woman from a
different band and secretly gave her two more young, he would double the
number of his descendants. Likewise, an ancestral woman who was wedded to
one man yet became entranced by another might bear her sweetheart’s baby
and/or acquire extra food and protection for the children she had already borne.
In short, the fickle brain circuitry for romantic love is capricious by nature’s
design. It enabled our ancestors to follow two complementary reproductive
strategies in tandem. Nariokotomi Boy and all his relatives could make a
socially sanctioned mating relationship with one partner; with a clandestine
lover, they could beget additional babies and/or acquire extra resources as well.
Today many men and women still pursue this dual reproductive strategy. The
most recent statistics on American adultery come from a study done at the
National Opinion Research Center in Chicago in 1994. Here scientists polled
3,432 Americans between the ages of eighteen and fifty-nine on many aspects of
their sexuality.
34 One-fourth of these men and 15 percent of these women
revealed that they had philandered during their marriage. Others may be lying,
because many scientists think these figures are far too low.
35 American
philanderers even have children by their clandestine partners. In a 1998 program
to screen for genetic diseases, scientists were astonished to find that 10 percent
of children tested were not the offspring of their legal fathers.
36
These adulterers are hardly unique. Philandering is common in all human
societies on record.
37 “Cheating” is even common among other “socially
monogamous” creatures.
38
In a study of 180 species of songbirds, some 90
percent of females bore some infants that were genetically unrelated to the
“father” who fed them.
39
In fact, it has been said that the only truly monogamous
creature in the state of California is a particular kind of vole.
We were built to love and love again. What joy this passion brings when you
are single and starting out in life, divorced in middle age, or alone in your senior
years. What confusion, what sorrow this chemistry can generate when you are
married to someone you admire, then fall in love with someone else.
The independence of these emotion systems—lust, romantic attraction, and
attachment—evolved among our ancestors to enable men and women to
maintain several relationships at once. But this brain circuitry has created
tremendous turmoil today—contributing to our worldwide patterns of adultery
and divorce, the high incidence of sexual jealousy, stalking, and spousal
battering, and the prevalence of homicide, suicide, and clinical depression
associated with spurned passion.
Lost love. Almost everyone on earth knows the agony of rejection. Why do
you plummet into despair when you lose somebody you adore?

Lost Love: Rejection, Despair, and Rage
Lie still, lie still, my breaking heart;
My silent heart, lie still and break:
Life, and the world, and mine own self, are changed
For a dream’s sake.
Christina Rossetti
“Mirage”
1
“Walking inland, inland, inland, I am walking inland. Nobody loves me, she
least of all, so I walk inland.”
2 An anonymous Inuit of the Arctic recited this sad
poem in the 1890s.
Almost everyone in the world feels the agony of romantic rejection at some
point in their lives. I have met only three people who claimed never to have been
“dumped” by someone they adored. Two were men, one a woman. Both men
were handsome, healthy, rich, and exceedingly successful in business. The
woman was a young television star. These people are rare. Among college
students at Case Western Reserve, 93 percent of both sexes reported that they
had been spurned by someone they passionately loved. Ninety-five percent also
said they had rejected someone who was deeply in love with them.
3 Almost no
one in the world escapes the feelings of emptiness, hopelessness, fear, and fury
that rejection can create.
4 “Parting is,” as Emily Dickinson wrote, “all we need to
know of hell.”
Because my brain scanning colleagues and I wanted to understand the full
range of romantic feelings, we embarked on a second project: scanning the
brains of people who had recently been rejected by romantic partners. We found
many volunteers; all were in excruciating psychological pain. In spite of their
sorrow, perhaps because of it, they were willing to undergo fMRI testing. This
experiment is in progress as I write, but the participants have already told me a
great deal about this agony and the stages of despair the rejected lover must
endure.
Poet Donald Yates once wrote, “People who are sensible about love are
incapable of it.”
5 As you will see, few of us are sensible when it comes to
rejected romantic passion. We aren’t built for it.
Rejected Lovers
“Have you just been rejected in love? But can’t let go?” My colleagues and I
hung a flyer on the psychology bulletin board on the State University of New
York at Stony Brook campus that began with these words. We were determined
to scan the brains of men and women who had just been scorned in love. We
sought only those who were really suffering.
Rejected sweethearts were quick to respond. As with our earlier experiment,
we winnowed out those who were left-handed, had metal in their heads (such as
braces on their teeth), were taking antidepressant medications, and/or were
claustrophobic. Then I called the applicants and spoke to each at length,
discussing the details of their unhappy love affairs and carefully explaining what
would happen to them while in the brain scanner.
The procedure I described was the same as the one we used with our subjects
who were happily in love. Each participant would alternately look at a
photograph of his or her rejecting beloved and a neutral photo that generated no
positive or negative feelings; between these tasks the subject would do the mindcleansing job of counting backward from a large number in increments of seven.
Meanwhile, the fMRI machine would record their brain activity.
I found the pre-interviews difficult to do. I was deeply moved by each story
that I heard. It seemed to me that all these heartbroken men and women were
deeply depressed. I had expected this. But many were also angry, and it was this
unforeseen aspect of romantic rejection that made me come to realize the awful
power of this passion.
I first saw this scalding “love hatred,” as dramatist August Strindberg called
it, directly after my brain scanning session with Barbara.
Love Hatred
We had scanned Barbara’s brain when she was madly and happily in love with
Michael. Like all of the other subjects who were blissfully in love, Barbara had
emerged from the first experiment sparkling. Her eyes danced. She giggled
softly. She had gotten off the fMRI table gracefully, enthusiastically, full of
optimism. And she had commented on how pleased she had been to spend that
quiet time looking at the photograph of Michael, reviewing her memories of
their times together. But for Barbara this euphoria would not last. Five months
later Michael left her.
I learned this one morning when I walked into the psychology lab at SUNY
Stony Brook and found her sobbing at a large conference table. I was horrified to
see this lovely young woman so broken. Her hair was matted. She had lost
weight. Her face was colorless and streaked with trails of tears. She acted as if
she were carrying heavy weights on her arms; she hardly moved. And she told
me she was “miserable;” that her “self-esteem was shot.” “My thoughts,” she
said, “always go back to Michael … I have a lump of unhappiness in my chest.”
Indeed, she had spent that morning sitting on her bed, staring.
I was so touched by her sorrow that I had to leave the room. But as I stood in
a darkened nearby office to collect myself, I came to realize that Barbara might
be able to offer some incredibly valuable scientific information: she could show
us what happens in the brain when someone has recently been profoundly
disappointed in love.
So I apologetically asked Barbara if she would be willing to be scanned
again, this time as a subject who had been rejected in love. I warned her that
thinking about her relationship while in the brain scanner might trigger powerful
feelings, and I assured her that I would talk with her after the brain scanning
session to settle her down (if necessary) and that I would also like to call her at
home a few days after the procedure to make sure the experiment hadn’t caused
her further despair. Nevertheless, I explained, this scanning session might help
others who were suffering the way she was. I hesitantly suggested we do the
experiment the same day.
That sweet girl agreed.
As we walked toward the scanning lab, Barbara dragged; she looked as if she
were drowning in despair.
This was just the beginning. Although I had anticipated that Barbara would
be upset, I was staggered by what happened directly after the experiment ended.
Barbara leapt off the scanning table and bolted out the door, then out of the
building altogether. She didn’t give me time to talk with her or wait to collect her
$50.00 compensation for participating in the project. I was even more stupefied a
half hour later when she returned to get the money. She was wildly distraught. I
implored her to sit with me in the waiting room. She did. There she began to
talk.
She told me that while she had looked at Michael’s picture during the
experiment, she had recalled all of their arguments. “I will never get over him,”
she burst out; then she exploded into sobs. As she wept, I noticed something else
about Barbara: she was furious at me. She glared at me between her tears.
Suddenly she shrieked, “Why do you want to study this?” On she railed as I
stared at her, too stunned to speak. Gradually I realized something important: the
experience had triggered in Barbara what psychologist Reid Meloy calls
“abandonment rage.”
6 Barbara was not angry at me; she was furious at Michael.
She had attacked me because I was available.
Was the brain circuitry for passionate romantic love, I asked myself,
somehow directly connected to the brain networks for what psychologists call
hate/rage?
I had long believed that the opposite of love was not hate, but indifference.
Now I came to suspect that love and hate/rage might be intricately connected in
the human brain, and that indifference might run along an entirely different
circuit. Moreover, perhaps this brain link between love and hate/rage could help
explain why crimes of passion—such as stalking, homicide, and suicide—are so
common around the world: when an attachment is ruptured and the drive to love
is thwarted, the brain can easily turn this powerful force to fury.
Abandonment Paranoia
“No doubt this way is best. No doubt in time I’d learn To hate you like the rest I
once loved.”
7 Poet W. D. Snodgrass knew the same rage that Barbara felt.
Indeed, I saw this bitter anger in several other jilted subjects as they emerged
from the brain scanning machine.
I also saw paranoia—in a beautiful young woman named Karen. Karen’s
boyfriend, Tim, had deserted her three months earlier. They had been dating for
almost two years and planned to marry. They had picked out both an engagement
and a wedding ring. So when he left her for a woman at his office, she was
stunned. “I lost fifteen pounds in two weeks,” Karen moaned. She was still
having a hard time sleeping. “I think about him constantly,” she told me.
“Everything makes me sad. I don’t care what I look like, or who I’m with. I
don’t care about anything at all. It’s terrible; it hurts so much.” She had put all of
Tim’s pictures in a box and hidden them in her closet. And she was considering
taking antidepressants.
My day with Karen turned bizarre. She seemed dejected when I met her at
Grand Central Station in New York City the morning of the scan. But she was
convivial, indeed charming, on the two-hour train ride to Stony Brook. When we
got to the psychology lab, however, her mood changed from chatty to
despondent. On the way to lunch she was teary-eyed. She didn’t eat any of her
pizza or drink any of her Coke—not a bite or swallow. And she lagged behind as
we walked to the scanning lab. Later she told me that the experience had started
to overwhelm her. She had begun to feel that she shouldn’t have volunteered,
that she hated Tim, and that she didn’t want to be reminded of him. “This is all a
big mistake.”
Karen didn’t tell me this prior to the scanning session, however. We scanned
her brain without incident. But when she emerged from the machine, she was
highly agitated. Then it started: she turned on the radiologist, accusing the
astonished man of inserting the name “Tim” into the sounds of the MRI
machine. “Tim; Tim; Tim; Tim.” She told us she repeatedly heard Tim’s name as
she was looking at his photograph. I assured her over and over that we had not
deceived her; that we could not possibly tinker with this complex multimilliondollar machine even if we wanted to; and that I wouldn’t dream of terrorizing
her by inserting Tim’s name into the sounds of the scanner.
She didn’t seem to believe me until we got back onto the train—some two
hours and several beers later. Finally, when I thought I had regained her trust, I
warily asked her if anyone in her family was paranoid. “Yes,” she offered, “my
mother.” I didn’t pursue the conversation further.
I questioned every participant immediately after they emerged from the MRI
machine. I wanted to know how they felt as they looked at the photograph of
their beloved, what went through their minds as they gazed at the neutral
photograph, and how they felt as they performed the count-back task.
Apparently as Karen looked at the photograph of Tim, her melancholy and
disappointment had turned to rage. Her anger must have then triggered paranoia
—because, as she told me later, only after she got angry did she think she heard
Tim’s name constantly repeated.
Rage, paranoia; only vaguely had I anticipated these reactions. But I had
fully expected our rejected subjects to emerge from the scanning machine
unhappy. I was right. One young woman cried so hard during the experiment
that she soaked the pillow we use to secure each subject’s head. In fact, I saw
this anguish in almost all our love-scorned subjects. And with each encounter I
could not escape thinking about the countless other men and women in every
corner of the world who have suffered the same despair.
Love Despair
“Mother, I cannot mind my wheel; My fingers ache, my lips are dry; Oh! If you
felt the pain I feel! / But oh, who ever felt as I!”
8 To answer Sappho’s desperate
query made over twenty-five hundred years ago: millions have felt the sorrow of
rejection in love.
From the Americas to Siberia, thousands have left lyric remembrances of
their heartache. An Aztec Indian left these melancholy words in the sixteenth
century: “Now I know / why my father would go out and cry / in the rain.”
9 “I
look at the hand you held, and the ache is hard to bear,” a Japanese poet wrote.
10
And Edna St. Vincent Millay left these wrenching lines: “Sweet love, sweet
thorn, when lightly to my heart / I took your thrust, whereby I since am slain,
And lie disheveled in the grass apart, A sodden thing bedrenched by tears and
rain.”
11
Anthropologists have collected evidence of this sorrow, too. A forsaken
Chinese woman confided, “I can’t bear life. All my interests in life have
disappeared.”
12 “I was lonely and really sad and I cried. I stopped eating and
didn’t sleep well; I couldn’t keep my mind on my work,” a scorned Polynesian
woman moaned.
13 Up the Sepik River in New Guinea, rejected men compose
tragic love songs they call “namai,” songs about marriages that “might have
been.”
14 And in India, brokenhearted men and women have formed a club, the
Society for the Study of Broken Hearts. Each year, on the third day of May, they
celebrate National Broken Hearts Day, swapping stories and consoling one
another.
15
Rejection by a sweetheart plunges a lover into one of the most profound and
troubling emotional pains a human being can bear. Sorrow, anger, and many
other feelings can sweep through the brain with such vigor that one can hardly
eat or sleep. The degrees and shades of this powerful malaise must be as varied
as human beings are. Yet psychiatrists and neuroscientists divide romantic
rejection into two general phases: “Protest” and “Resignation/despair.”
16
During the protest phase, deserted lovers obsessively try harder to win back
their beloveds. As resignation sets in, they give up entirely and slip into despair.
Stage I: Protest
As a person begins to realize a beloved is thinking of ending the relationship,
they generally become intensely restless. Overcome by longing and nostalgia,
they devote almost all their time, their energy, and their attention to their
departing mate. Their obsession: reunion with their lover.
Many of our scanning subjects found it difficult to sleep. Several had lost
weight. Some trembled. Others sighed as they spoke to me of their sweethearts
during the prescanning interview. They all reminisced, fixating on the troubled
times, repeatedly searching for clues as to what went wrong and pondering on
how to patch up the crumbling partnership. And all of them told me they never
stopped thinking about their “rejecter”; every waking hour they were plagued by
thoughts of “him” or “her.”
Spurned lovers also take extraordinary measures to reconnect with their
former partner, revisiting mutual haunts, phoning day and night, writing letters,
or incessantly e-mailing. They plead. They make dramatic entrances into a
beloved’s home or place of work, then storm out, only to return and renew their
appeal for reconciliation. Most become so focussed on this missing partner that
everything reminds them of their sweetheart. As poet Kenneth Fearing put it,
“tonight you are in my hair and eyes, And every street light that our taxi passes
shows me You again, still you.”
17
Most of all, rejected people yearn for reunion. So they protest, relentlessly
seeking the slightest sign of hope.
Frustration Attraction
“Love is a sickness full of woes All remedies refusing; A plant that with most
cutting grows, Most barren with best using, Why so?” The seventeenth-century
poet Samuel Daniel pinpointed this peculiarity of romantic love: as adversity
intensifies, so does romantic passion. This phenomenon is so common in
literature and in life that I coined a term for it: “frustration attraction.” And I
suspect that frustration attraction is associated with brain chemistry.
As you know, dopamine is produced in factories in the “basement” of the
brain, then pumped up to the caudate nucleus and other brain regions where it
generates the motivation to win designated rewards. If an expected reward is
delayed in coming, however, these dopamine-producing neurons prolong their
activities—increasing brain levels of this natural stimulant.
18 And very high
levels of dopamine are associated with intense motivation and goal-directed
behaviors, as well as with anxiety and fear.
19 The Roman dramatist Terence
unknowingly summed up this chemistry of frustration attraction, saying, “The
less my hope, the hotter my love.”
Psychiatrists Thomas Lewis, Fari Amini, and Richard Lannon maintain that
this protest response is a basic mammalian mechanism that activates when any
kind of social attachment is ruptured.
20 They use the example of the puppy.
When you remove the puppy from its mother and put it in the kitchen by itself, it
begins to pace. Frantically, tirelessly it combs the floor, scratches at the door,
leaps at the walls, barks and whines in protest. Baby rats that are isolated from
their mother hardly sleep because their brain arousal is so intense.
21
And these psychiatrists believe, as I do, that this protest reaction is associated
with elevated levels of dopamine, as well as with norepinephrine. Rising levels
of dopamine and norepinephrine, they say, serve to increase alertness and
stimulate the abandoned individual to search and call for help.
Indeed, protest can be quite effective in love relationships. Those doing the
abandoning often feel deeply guilty about causing the breakup.
22 So the more the
rejected partner protests, the more the departing one is likely to reconsider and
return to the relationship. Many do, at least temporarily. Protest works.
Not always, however. And sometimes the romantic rift can cause the
abandoned partner to panic.
Separation Anxiety
Like the impulse to protest, this panic response is common in nature; it is called
“separation anxiety.”
23 When a mother leaves a baby bird or infant mammal,
these tiny creatures often become profoundly disturbed. Their discomfort starts
with a pounding heart. The baby cries and makes sucking gestures. These
“distress calls” are frantic and frequent. Abandoned puppies and baby otters
whimper, even sob. Baby chickens cheep. Infant rhesus monkeys dolefully give
out a “hoo-hoo” sound. When baby rats are separated from their mother, they
emit ceaseless ultrasonic cries.
24 Neuroscientist Jaak Panksepp believes that
separation anxiety is generated by the panic system in the brain—a complex
brain network that makes one feel weak, short of breath, and panicky.
25
A related brain system also kicks into action: the stress system. Stress begins
in the hypothalamus where corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is secreted
and travels to the nearby pituitary; here it initiates the release of ACTH,
adrenocorticotropin hormone. This travels through the bloodstream to the
adrenal gland (which sits atop the kidney) and commands the adrenal cortex to
synthesize and release cortisol, the “stress hormone.” Cortisol then activates
myriad brain and bodily systems to counteract stress. Among them, the immune
system revs up to fight disease.
26 Despite this bodily readiness, disappointed
lovers tend to get sore throats and colds. Short-term stress also triggers
production of dopamine and norepinephrine and suppresses serotonin activity
27
—the combination of elixirs associated with romantic love.
How ironic: as the adored one slips away, the very chemicals that contribute
to feelings of romance grow even more potent, intensifying ardent passion, fear,
and anxiety, and impelling us to protest and try with all our strength to secure
our reward: the departing loved one.
Abandonment Rage
The attempt to win back one’s sweetheart, a craving for “him” or “her,”
separation anxiety, and panic at the impending loss: all these reactions make
sense to me. But what causes rejected people to get so fiercely angry? Even
when the parting lover honors his or her responsibilities as a friend (and often
co-parent) and leaves the relationship with compassion and honesty, many
rejected people swing violently from feelings of heartbreak to utter fury. English
poet John Lyly commented wisely on this phenomenon in 1579, “As the best
wine doth make the sharpest vinegar, so the deepest love turneth to the deadliest
hate.”
Why so?
Because love and hate are intricately linked in the human brain. The primary
circuits for hate/rage run through regions of the amygdala downward to the
hypothalamus and on to centers in the peri-aqueductal gray, a region in the
midbrain.
28 Several other brain areas are also involved in rage, including the
insula, a part of the cortex that collects data from the internal body and the
senses.
29 But here’s the key: the basic brain network for rage is closely connected
to centers in the prefrontal cortex that process reward-assessment and reward
expectation.
30 And when people and other animals begin to realize that an
expected reward is in jeopardy, even unattainable, these centers in the prefrontal
cortex signal the amygdala and trigger rage.
31
Known to psychologists as the “frustration-aggression hypothesis,” this rage
response to unfulfilled expectations is well known in animals. For example,
when a cat’s brain circuits for reward are artificially stimulated, they feel intense
pleasure. If this stimulation is withdrawn, however, they bite. And each time the
pleasure is withdrawn, the cat gets angrier. Likewise, scorned lovers just get
more and more furious. “All our reasoning ends in surrender to feeling,” wrote
Blaise Pascal. Pascal clearly knew how victimized we can be by our emotions.
Fury need not be directed at the lost reward, however.
32 An enraged monkey
will vent his ire on a subordinate monkey rather than attack a superior. In the
same way, a rejected lover might kick a chair, throw a glass, or get angry at a
friend or colleague rather than strike an errant sweetheart.
So romantic love and abandonment rage are well connected in the brain. And
when you think about it, these passions have much in common. They are both
associated with bodily and mental arousal; both produce excessive energy. Both
drive one to obsessively focus one’s attention on the beloved. Both generate
goal-directed behaviors. And both cause intense yearning, either for union with a
sweetheart or for revenge against a jilting loved one.
No wonder our scanning subject, Barbara, turned on me. Barbara must have
felt deep romantic love for Michael as she looked at his photograph in the fMRI
machine; then her thwarted passion turned to frustration, which triggered hate
and rage. I just happened to be a convenient target.
“One of the relics of early man is modern man,” wrote psychiatrist David
Hamburg. Why did our ancestors evolve brain links that enable us to hate the
one we cherish?
The Purpose of Abandonment Rage
Rage is exceedingly expensive, metabolically. It stresses the heart, raises blood
pressure, and suppresses the immune system.
33 So in ancestral times this link
between romantic love and abandonment rage probably evolved to solve an
important problem related to mating and reproduction.
At first, I suspected that this brain wiring might have emerged for an entirely
different courtship purpose: to fight rival suitors.
“The season of love is that of battle,” Darwin wrote.
34
Indeed, many male
animals do two things at mating time: They court. And they fight competitors.
Male sheep, male sea lions, and males of many other species must fight one
another to win the right to woo. So I reasoned that perhaps attraction and
hate/rage became closely connected in the mammalian brain in order to enable
suitors to easily switch back and forth between attraction for a potential mate
and rage at a rival. But this theory didn’t hold up under closer scrutiny.
Combative male suitors strut and pose and attack one another like gladiators
in a duel for love and honor. And when the match is over the winner regularly
displays feelings of triumph while the loser slinks off in ignominy. But neither
shows fury. There is even sound biological evidence that the neural system for
male-male courtship competition is independent of the rage system in the brain.
This rivalry is associated with elevated levels of testosterone and vasopressin
instead.
35 So human abandonment rage did not evolve from the
emotion/motivation systems that mammals use to fight rivals.
Then why does the human brain easily enable an abandoned lover to hate the
person that he or she adores?
Psychiatrist John Bowlby argued in the 1960s that the anger that
accompanies the loss of a loved one is part of nature’s biological design to regain
the lost attachment figure.
36 Undoubtedly this rage sometimes serves this
purpose. But fury is not a likeable trait; I can’t imagine it often entices a lover to
return to a disintegrating relationship.
So I have come to think that abandonment rage evolved to serve another
purpose: to drive disappointed lovers to extricate themselves from dead-end
matches, lick their wounds, and resume their quest for love in greener pastures.
Moreover, if the rejected person has produced babies during this bankrupt
partnership, abandonment rage may give them the energy to fight for the welfare
of their children. You certainly see this behavior in contemporary divorce
proceedings. Well-adjusted men and women turn vicious to acquire resources for
their abandoned young. In fact, an American judge who regularly presides over
trials of violent criminals reports that he is much more worried about his
personal safety during divorce proceedings, particularly when child custody is an
issue. He and other judges have even installed panic buttons in their chambers to
push for help in case arguing spouses become violent.
37
I am not surprised that abandonment rage sometimes erupts into violence.
Jilted men and women have wasted priceless reproductive time and energy on a
partner who is deserting them. They must start their courtship search again.
Moreover, their reproductive future has been jeopardized—along with their
social alliances, their personal happiness, and their reputation. Their self-esteem
is severely damaged. And time is dribbling by. Nature has given us a powerful
purgative mechanism to help us release a rejecting mate and get on with living:
rage.
Alas, this rage does not necessarily cancel out one’s love, one’s longing, or
one’s sexual desire for a departing partner.
In an interesting study of 124 dating couples, psychologists Bruce Ellis and
Neil Malamuth found that romantic love and what they call “anger/upset”
respond to different kinds of “information.”
38 One’s degree of anger/upset
oscillates in response to events that undermine one’s goals, such as infidelity or
lack of emotional commitment by the partner. One’s feelings of romantic love
fluctuate, instead, in response to occurrences that advance one’s goals, such as a
partner’s social support and happy times in bed together. Hence love and
anger/upset, though closely linked, are independent systems; they can operate
simultaneously. In short, you can be terribly angry but still be very much in love.
Such was Barbara.
Eventually, however, all these feelings wane. The focussed attention on the
failing partnership, the drive to win back the beloved, the showdowns, the
separation anxiety, the panic, even the rage: all dissipate with time. Then the
rejected person must deal with new forms of torture—resignation and despair.
Stage II: Resignation
“I am exhausted by longing,” wrote the eighth-century A.D. Chinese poet Li Po.
Eventually the disappointed lover gives up. Their beloved is gone forever and
they are spent. Many plummet into hopelessness. They toss in bed and cry.
Drugged by the potent liquor of sorrow, some just woodenly sit and gaze into a
void. They hardly work or eat. Perhaps they feel an occasional urge to renew
pursuit of their lost love or a passing flash of anger. Generally, they feel deep
melancholy. Nothing pries them from their anguish—except time.
Loss of a loved one usually triggers deep sadness and depression in the
human animal, what is known to psychologists as the “despair response.”
39
In
my love survey discussed in chapter one, 61 percent of men and 46 percent of
women said that they went through periods of despair when they thought their
beloved might not love them (Appendix, #53). And in a study of 114 men and
women who had been rejected by a partner within the past eight weeks, over 40
percent were experiencing “clinically measurable depression”; of these, some 12
percent displayed moderate to severe depression.
40 People can also die of a
broken heart. They expire from heart attacks or strokes caused by their
depression.
41
Men and women tend to handle love-sadness differently.
Men are often more dependent on their romantic partners,
42 probably because
men, as a rule, have fewer ties to relatives and friends. Perhaps because of this,
men are more likely to turn to alcohol, drugs, or reckless driving than to their kin
or buddies when they despair over a rejecting mate.
43 Moreover, men are less
likely to reveal their pain, containing their sorrow within their inner mental
core.
44 Some even score low on scales of depression because they have
effectively masked their suffering, even from themselves.
45
Though many cloak their sorrow, interviews with rejected men, and
observation of their work performance, their daily habits, and their interactions
with friends, often reveal that they are ill—psychologically and physically.
46
Men also show their sorrow in the most dramatic way one can: men are three to
four times more likely than women to commit suicide after a love affair has
decayed.
47 As poet John Dryden put it, “Dying is a pleasure, / when living is a
pain.”
48
Women often suffer differently. In cultures around the world, women are
twice as likely as men to experience major depression.
49 They become depressed
for many reasons, of course, but a common one is abandonment by a lover. And
in studies of romantic rejection, women report more severe feelings of
depression, particularly hopelessness.
50
Rejected women sob, lose weight, sleep too much or not at all, lose interest
in sex, can’t concentrate, have trouble remembering commonplace daily things,
withdraw socially, and contemplate suicide. Locked in a dungeon of
despondency, they barely manage life’s basic chores. Some write out their
grievances. And many women talk, moping for hours on the phone with any
sympathetic ear, retelling all. Although this chatter gives women some relief,
these replays of shattered dreams often backfire. As a woman dwells on the dead
relationship, she feeds the ghost—often inadvertently retraumatizing herself.
51
This second phase of rejection—resignation coupled with despair—is well
documented in other species. Infant mammals suffer terribly when they are
separated from their mother. Remember the puppy? When you isolate it in the
kitchen, at first it protests. Eventually, however, it curls up in a corner into a
despondent heap. Abandoned infant monkeys suck on their fingers or their toes,
clasp themselves, and often curl into a fetal position and rock.
52
The feeling of despair has been associated with several different networks in
the mammalian (including human) brain.
53 Among them is the brain’s reward
system and its fuel: dopamine. As the abandoned partner gradually realizes that
the reward will never come, the dopamine-making cells in the midbrain (that
became so active during the protest phase) now decrease their activity.
54 And
diminishing levels of dopamine are associated with lethargy, despondency, and
depression.
55 The stress system also contributes. As you may recall, short-term
stress activates the production of dopamine and norepinephrine and suppresses
serotonin. But as the stress of abandonment wears on, it drives levels of all these
potent substances down below normal—producing profound depression.
56
Shakespeare called the brain the “soul’s frail dwelling place.” It is also a frail
dwelling place for romantic love.
Depression as an Adaptation?
Like abandonment rage, the despair response may seem counterproductive.
What’s the point of suffering pain and misery when you have lost a sweetheart?
Isn’t it better to recover your energy than waste it crying?
Many scientists now believe, however, that there are good reasons for
depression, so good that this complex brain circuitry evolved as a coping
mechanism millions of years ago.
57 Some maintain it originally emerged to
enable abandoned infant mammals to conserve stamina, discourage them from
wandering until their mother returns, and keep them quiet and thus protected
from predators. Depression thus enabled animals to conserve energy in times of
stress. Depression also could have driven ancestral humans to abandon hopeless
ventures and adopt more successful strategies to achieve their goals—
particularly reproductive goals such as getting married.
58
Despair is such a debilitating experience that it must have evolved for many
good reasons. A related purpose I particularly like is proposed by anthropologist
Edward Hagen, biologist Paul Watson, and psychiatrist Andy Thomson. These
scientists believe that the very high metabolic and social cost of depression is
actually its benefit: one’s depression is an honest, believable signal to others that
something is desperately wrong. Hence depression evolved, they say, to enable
stressed ancestors to signal for and acquire social support in times of intense
need,
59 particularly when they were unable to verbally persuade or use force to
get friends and relatives to support their cause.
An example would be a young woman living a million years ago whose
husband openly pursued and copulated with another woman in their camp. At
first the young wife bitterly protested, flew into jealous rages, and tried to
persuade her husband to dismiss the interloper. Furious, she also appealed to her
father and other kin to support her request. Unable to influence her spouse or
relatives with words or tantrums, however, she became deeply depressed. This
affliction further disrupted camp life, not to mention her ability to gather
vegetables and help take care of kids and other kin. So eventually her
despondency galvanized her kinfolk to drive out this flagrantly unfaithful
husband and console her until she could recover her vitality, find a new man, and
contribute more food, child care—and gaiety—to the group.
Aeschylus, the classical Greek dramatist of the fifth century B.C., saw another
merit in depression. As he proclaimed in Agamemnon, “He who learns must
suffer. And even in our sleep, pain that cannot forget falls drop by drop upon the
heart, and in our own despair, against our will, comes wisdom to us by the awful
grace of god.” Depression, in short, can give you insight. Scientists can now
explain why. Mildly depressed people make clearer assessments of themselves
and others.
60 As psychologist Jeffrey Zeig puts it, “They suffer a failure of
denial.” Even severe and prolonged depression can push a person to accept
unhappy facts, make decisions, and resolve conflicts that will ultimately promote
their survival and capacity to reproduce.
61
So, like the protest response, the despair of rejection probably evolved for a
number of reasons. Among them, depressed lovers were able to assemble
familiar, loving, patient, compassionate friends and kin around them and use
their heightened mental acuity to appraise themselves and their failed love
affairs, set new goals, review their courtship tactics, and try their luck again—
perhaps even win a more suitable mating partner. The pain rejected men and
women endured probably even steered them away from making similar bad
choices in the future.
In discussing the evolutionary value of despair, one must distinguish, of
course, between the sorrow of romantic rejection and the depression that can
accompany a severe, long-term, internal mental disorder, such as bipolar
depression. What we are concerned about here is the deep grief that normally
well-balanced men and women feel for a period of time when they are cast aside
by someone they adore.
Not everyone suffers to the same degree, of course. How we react to
rejection depends on many forces—including our upbringing. Some people
make secure attachments as children and have the self-esteem and resilience to
overcome a romantic setback relatively quickly. Others grow up in loveless
homes fraught with tension, chaos, or rejection—leaving them clingy, or
defenseless in other ways.
62 As we venture into life, we develop new feelings of
competence or incompetence, different sorts of romantic expectations, and
different coping mechanisms that affect how we weather lost love.
63 Some
people have more mating opportunities than others; they easily replace a
rejecting partner with amorous distractions that mitigate their feelings of protest
and despair. And we are all wired differently; some are simply less angry, less
depressed, more self-confident, and more relaxed about life’s disasters in general
or about romantic rejection in particular.
Still, we human beings are intricately wired to suffer when we have been
spurned by a beloved. Everywhere on earth men and women can recall the bitter
details of their distress—even many years after the turmoil has defused.
64 For a
good evolutionary reason. Those who love and mate and breed will pass on their
genes toward posterity, while those who lose in love and sex and reproduction
will ultimately die out.
We are designed to suffer when love fails.
Alas, the feelings that accompany rejection can lead some men and women
to deeds that earn the deadly mark of Cain.
Crimes of Passion: Jealousy
“We must in tears / Unwind a love knit up in many years. In this last kiss I here
surrender thee Back to thyself. Lo thou again art free.”
65 Poet Henry King was
able to let a departing lover go.
Some people find this impossible to do. Even before a partner actually leaves
a relationship men and women can be exceedingly possessive of “him” or “her.”
Jealousy is common around the world.
66
In fact, as discussed in chapter two, this
possessiveness is so common in all of nature that scientists call it “mate
guarding.”
When a relationship is threatened by a rival suitor, some jealous people sulk.
Others monopolize the mate’s spare time, conceal the loved one by not taking
him or her to parties, or even scold a mate who talks to others in social
situations. Some try to make a sweetheart jealous in return. Many also try to
appear more important, sexier, richer, or smarter than a potential competitor, as
well as irresistible themselves. Some shower a beloved with presents and
affection to keep the beloved’s undivided attention. And some threaten to kill
themselves if their partner leaves them for another.
Men and women become jealous over many of the same things. When either
sex sees a partner flirting with others, they can become ferociously possessive.
Catching a mate kissing, fondling, or copulating with another seriously unhinges
most men and women.
67 At different times in life and in different societies, men
and women vary in what makes them jealous.
68 But young men and women do
show some consistent differences in what triggers feelings of rejection and how
they manage a jealous heart.
Men bristle over actual or imagined sexual infidelity.
69 This male bias may
have an evolutionary origin. A man runs a considerable risk if he is cuckolded:
he could expend an enormous amount of time and energy raising another man’s
DNA. And men are more likely to challenge a rival, assailing him with nasty
words or heavy fists. In many societies, men are also more likely than women to
divorce a spouse they believe is sexually unfaithful—which may be a reflection
of the male tendency to fear cuckoldry.
If men fear being cuckolded, women fear being abandoned—emotionally and
financially.
70 So if the relationship begins to founder, women take steps to
overcome the obstacles. Women are more likely than men to overlook a mate’s
“one-night stand” or temporary sexual fling with a rival. But if a woman thinks
her mate is building a serious emotional attachment to another woman, or knows
he is spending valuable time and money on this competitor, she can become
exceedingly jealous.
This behavior also makes Darwinian sense. For millions of years ancestral
women needed mates to help them rear their young. Hence, women have
evolved brain mechanisms to make them exceedingly possessive when a mate
threatens to withdraw resources or emotional support or abandon the relationship
for another.
“Love’s like a torch, which if secured from blasts, Will faintlier burn; but
then it longer lasts. Exposed to storms of jealousy and doubt, / The blaze grows
greater, but ‘tis sooner out.” So wrote poet William Walsh.
71 At first glance,
jealousy appears to be a death knell to a love affair. But psychologists believe it
can stimulate a mate to soothe the mistrustful partner with declarations of
fidelity and attachment. Indeed, these reassurances can contribute to the
durability of the relationship.
72
Jealousy can undermine a love affair, however, and this response can also be
adaptive. Jealous men and women are often picking up genuine signals that the
relationship is failing. And every day they remain tied to uncommitted partners,
they lose opportunities to catch more suitable mates—as well as risk picking up
sexually transmitted diseases.
So jealousy has reproductive payoffs. It can strengthen a partnership or
destroy it. Either way, jealousy is useful. As a result, this unpleasant trait has
become deeply threaded into the skein of human romantic love, part of an array
of powerful feelings our forebears needed on the grasslands of ancient Africa to
win the courtship game.
When a lover departs for good, however, jealousy, the drive to protest,
feelings of depression, and all the other disruptive forces that accompany lost
love can lead to violence—and tragedy.
Stalking, Battering, Killing
Men stalk. They obsessively follow and often threaten or harass a lover who has
left them.
73 Some shower a departed woman with vile or entreating messages.
Some steal valuables or personal items such as underwear. Some follow a former
partner in their cars. Others loiter near the partner’s home or place of work to
jeer or plea. In one study of American college students, 34 percent of women
said they had been followed or harassed by a man they had rejected.
74 And one
out of twelve American women will be stalked by a man at some point in her
life, usually by a former spouse or lover. In fact, the Justice Department reports
that every year over a million American women are stalked (most are between
ages eighteen and thirty-nine); 59 percent of them are stalked by boyfriends,
husbands, former spouses, or live-in partners.
75 One out of four women are also
hit, slapped, shoved, or otherwise physically assaulted by their stalkers.
76
In fact,
five independent investigators on three continents report that in some 55 percent
to 89 percent of cases, stalkers became violent toward former sexual intimates.
77
Most are men.
Men also batter. One-third of all American women seeking emergency
medical care, one of four women who attempt suicide, and some 20 percent of
pregnant women who seek prenatal care have been battered by an intimate
partner.
78 And in a study of thirty-one battered American women, twenty-nine
reported that a male partner’s jealousy was a frequent cause of the beatings.
79
These statistics are not surprising. The most common cause of wife battering
everywhere in the world is male possessiveness.
80
Men kill too. About 32 percent of all female murder victims in the United
States die at the hands of spouses, ex-spouses, boyfriends, and ex-boyfriends,
but experts believe the true numbers may be as high as 50 percent to 70 percent
instead.
81 Over 50 percent of these murderers stalk their lover first.
82 Men
commit the vast majority of spousal homicides in all other countries, too.
83
The classic tale of jealous murder is Shakespeare’s Othello. What a mess.
Othello, a dark-skinned Moor, had achieved the rank of general because of his
valor in the Venetian wars against the Turks. Now returned to Venice, he meets
Desdemona, the beautiful daughter of a senator. The Moor and the maiden fall in
love almost instantly; secretly they marry. But Othello has used a go-between,
Cassio, to help court the fair Desdemona. And to reward the young soldier, he
promotes him to be his chief lieutenant.
Iago, one of the most treacherous villains in all of Western literature, coveted
this rank. He smolders with concealed hatred for Cassio and the Moor. And he
vows revenge. Craftily, Iago begins to feed Othello false innuendos about
Desdemona’s sexual infidelity with Cassio. The Moor is a naive man,
commanding in temperament and swift to action. He soon begins to seethe with
jealousy, raging, “I had rather be a toad, / And live upon the vapor of a dungeon,
Than keep a corner in the thing I love For others’ uses.”
84 Finally driven wild,
Othello suffocates his adoring and faithful wife.
Historically many societies have fostered this male predilection to guard a
mate from poachers or desertion. English common law regarded the slaughter of
an adulterous wife as understandable, even justified—if done in the heat of
passion.
85 Legal traditions in Europe, Asia, Africa, Melanesia, and among
American Indians historically also condoned or overlooked murder by a jealous
husband.
86 And until the 1970s, in several American states it was lawful to kill
an adulterous wife.
87
At the base of all this violence is a primordial male urge to protect oneself
from cuckoldry and hold on to the vessel that may bear their DNA. Not
surprisingly, American women—from all ethnic groups and economic
backgrounds—are six times more likely than men to be victims in crimes of
passion between intimates.
88
Feminine Vengeance
Women are far less likely to maim or murder when they are jealous of a rival and
fearful of abandonment. They tend to berate themselves for their own
inadequacies and try to lure and seduce instead, hoping to recapture their mate’s
affections and rebuild the relationship.
89 They are also more likely to try to
understand the problems and talk things over. But when all this fails, some
women stalk. Some 370,000 American men reported being stalked in 1997; most
were between the ages of eighteen and thirty-nine—men of reproductive age.
90
Unlike men, many female stalkers have other mental problems. Like men,
however, they send e-mails or letters, phone ceaselessly, or appear unexpectedly
as they obsessively follow a departed mate. I know of one woman who used to
sleep on her former lover’s doorstep.
Women also kill rejecting lovers. But far fewer take this drastic step. In 1998,
only 4 percent of male homicide victims were killed by a former or current
female partner.
91
Of all the tales of female mayhem, the most shocking to my mind is that of
Medea, the princess of ancient Colchis. As told by the Greek dramatist Euripides
in the fifth century B.C., Medea was “mad with love for Jason,” a Greek.
92 To
help him in his quest to retrieve the Golden Fleece, she was disloyal to her
father, set her sisters against her brother and had him slain, and fled her
homeland. Then Medea traveled with Jason to settle in Corinth with their two
young sons. Alas, the ambitious Jason deserted her to marry the daughter of
Creon, king of Corinth. As Medea’s children’s nurse says of Medea, “She will
not eat; she lies collapsed in agony, / Dissolving the long hours in tears.”
93
Finally the tormented Medea sends Jason’s new wife a wedding present—a
poisoned dress that erupts into flames and burns the Corinthian princess and the
king to death. But Medea is not through with Jason. She slaughters their two
sons, too. In effect, Medea murdered Jason’s living genes and destroyed his
reproductive future.
Like love, hate is blind; for some, no form of violence is too extreme. And
this violence is driven, in least in part, by brain chemistry. As you recall, when
lovers are first rejected, they protest—a reaction that is accompanied by soaring
levels of dopamine and norepinephrine. These elevated levels of natural
stimulants probably give the stalker, the batterer, and the murderer their focussed
attention and wild energy. Moreover, rising levels of dopamine often reduce
levels of serotonin in the brain. And low levels of serotonin are associated with
impulsive violence against others.
94
Stalkers and murderers are responsible for their crimes of passion, of course.
Indeed, we have evolved sophisticated brain mechanisms for curbing our violent
impulses. Nevertheless, we do carry within us a “fatal reflex,” as psychologist
William James called our human ferocity. And some wretched men and women
do not contain it: they slaughter their sweethearts.
Others kill themselves.
Love Suicide
Human beings are the only creatures on earth who commit violent suicide in
high numbers.
It is difficult to obtain accurate accounts of why healthy people kill
themselves; solid statistics are lacking. Loss of money, power, status, or respect,
or the realization that one will never achieve a long-sought goal can drive a
person to quit this life. But most men and women don’t have a lot of money,
power, prestige, or goals they can’t attain. They do, however, fall desperately in
love. And romantic love, as you know, is associated with high levels of
dopamine and probably norepinephrine—brain substances that often drive down
levels of serotonin. Not coincidentally, I think, low levels of serotonin are
associated with suicide.
95
In short, when a love affair turns sour, the human brain is already chemically
set up for depression—and possible self annihilation. I suspect many of the men
and women around the world who kill themselves do so over lost love. For
centuries, the Japanese even glorified this act, regarding “love suicide,” as they
called it, as an honorable statement of one’s devotion.
96
Attempted love suicide may even have been adaptive in ancestral times.
97
Many suicidal people, largely women, fail to actually kill themselves. And
psychiatrists now believe these cases are examples of an extreme strategy that
jilted women use to manipulate a lover into returning to the relationship. Alas,
many misjudge their tactics and mistakenly kill themselves instead. Suicide is
unquestionably maladaptive. Yet it is prevalent everywhere, particularly among
men. For these unfortunate people the primordial drive to love triumphed over
their will to live.
“How cruel, you say. But did I not warn you? Shall I count for you love’s
ways? Fear, jealousy, revenge—pain. They all belong to love’s innocent game.”
These words come across the centuries to us from the Celtic legend of Tristan
and Iseult. How can you stifle this passion for a partner who has deserted you?
How can you induce romantic feelings in someone you find attractive, even
jump-start a feeling of romantic rapture in yourself? Perhaps most important,
how can one maintain the euphoria of romantic love in a long-term partnership?
I think we can control this passion. But one has to trick the brain.
8
Taking Control of Passion: Making Romance Last
How say you? Let us, O my dove,
Let us be unashamed of soul,
As earth lies bare to heaven above!
How is it under our control
To love or not to love?
Robert Browning
“Two in the Campagna”
“Her whole character seemed to change with her change of fortune. Her sorrows,
the depression of spirits, were forgotten, and she assumed all the simplicity and
vivacity of a youthful mind.… She was playful, full of confidence, kindness and
sympathy. Her eyes assumed new lustre, and her cheeks new colour and
smoothness. Her voice became cheerful; her temper overflowing with universal
kindness; and that smile of bewitching tenderness from day to day illuminated
her countenance.” The handsome, dashing, auburn-haired Mary Wollstonecraft,
founder of the British feminist movement in the late eighteenth century, had
fallen in love.
1
“Love’s weather is so fair,” wrote William Cavendish.
2
Indeed, we radiate
when we love. We also agonize and hope. Most of all we crave; we want to see
and touch and laugh and love and to be loved in return. Fueled by one of nature’s
most stimulating chemicals, we galvanize our energy, focus our attention, and
seek our prize. Romantic love is an urge, a want, a need—a primordial mating
drive that can be, at times, more powerful than hunger.
Addicted to Love
World poetry and literature even refer to romantic passion as a form of hunger.
In the Song of Songs, the ancient Hebrew love poem, the woman exclaimed, “I
am starved for his love.”
3
In the Chinese fable “The Jade Goddess,” Chang Po
said to his beloved, Meilan, I “crave to see you.”
4
In the Arabian tale, Majnun
cried out, “My beloved, send a greeting, a message, a word. I am starving for a
token, a gesture from you.”
5 And Richard de Fournival in his thirteenth-century
book, Advice on Love, said of this magic, “Love is an unquenchable fire, a
hunger without surfeit.”
Because romantic love is such a euphoric “high,” because this passion is
exceedingly difficult to control, and because it produces craving, obsession,
compulsion, distortion of reality, emotional and physical dependence, personality
change, and loss of self-control, many psychologists regard romantic love as an
addiction—a positive addiction when your love is returned, a horribly negative
fixation when your love is spurned and you can’t let go.
6
Our fMRI experiment on people in love supports this proposition: romantic
love is an addictive drug.
Directly or indirectly, virtually all “drugs of abuse” affect a single pathway in
the brain, the mesolimbic reward system, activated by dopamine.
7 Romantic love
stimulates parts of the same pathway with the same chemical. In fact, when
neuroscientists Andreas Bartels and Semir Zeki compared the brain scans of
their love-stricken subjects with those of men and women who had injected
cocaine or opioids, they found that many of the same brain regions became
active, including the insular cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex, the caudate,
and the putamen.
8
Moreover, the bewitched lover shows the three classic symptoms of
addiction: tolerance, withdrawal, and relapse. At first the lover is content to see
the beloved now and then. But as the addiction escalates, they need more and
more of their “drug.” With time they hear themselves whispering, “I crave you,”
“I can’t get enough of you,” even “I can’t live without you.” When the lover is
out of touch with the beloved, even for a few hours, he or she longs for renewed
contact. Every phone call that is not from the beloved is a disappointment.
And if the beloved breaks off the relationship, the lover shows all the
common signs of drug withdrawal, including depression, crying spells, anxiety,
insomnia, loss of appetite (or binge eating), irritability, and chronic loneliness.
Like all addicts, the lover then goes to unhealthy, humiliating, even physically
dangerous lengths to procure their narcotic.
Lovers relapse the way drug addicts do, too. Long after the relationship is
over, simple events such as hearing a particular song or revisiting an old haunt
can trigger the lover’s craving and initiate compulsive calling or writing to get
another “high”: a romantic moment with the beloved. Racine had it right when
he called the lover a “slave of passion.”
How can we smooth the journey back to sanity and liberation when our love
has been rejected? How do we jump-start romance in someone else or in
ourselves? And how can we make this passion last?
Love Sickness: Letting Go
“Nothing can affection’s course control, / or stop the headlong fury of his
speed.” Shakespeare believed romantic passion was uncontrollable. I think this
addiction can be conquered; it just takes determination and time. A little
knowledge of brain function and human nature can be helpful, too.
To begin with, you must remove all evidence of the addictive substance: the
beloved. Throw out cards and letters or stuff them in a box and put it out of
reach. Don’t call or write under any circumstances. And depart immediately if
you see your former lover in the office or the street. Why? Because as Charles
Dickens said, “Love … will thrive for a considerable time on a very slight and
sparing food.” Even the briefest contact with “him” or “her” can fire up your
brain circuits for romantic ardor. If you wish to recover, you must expunge all
traces of the thief who stole your heart.
Meditate. Develop a few mantras and silently repeat them. Something
positive about yourself and your future is best, even if it isn’t true—yet.
Something like, “I love being myself with a soul mate of my own.” Pick
something that boosts your self-esteem and projects your mind out of the failed
relationship and toward one that will succeed. And when you can’t stop thinking
about “him” or “her,” dwell on their negative traits. Write down their faults and
carry the list in your purse or pocket. You might also try fantasizing. Picture
yourself walking arm in arm with someone who adores you and you cherish, the
perfect partner. Make it up. And make it good. Someone is camping in your
brain; you must throw the scoundrel out.
The Fulbe of North Cameroon do just this. A bedeviled lover hires a shaman
to perform rituals to extricate the rejecting lover from their mind.
9 The ancient
Aztecs used a spell instead. Part of one has been preserved: “Come forth
Tlazopilli Centeotl, you will calm down the yellow heart, the green anger, the
yellow anger will come out. I shall make it leave. I shall chase it away—I, Spirit
in Flesh, I, the Enchanter, through this drink Medicine Spirit, will change this
heart.”
10
It is very important to stay busy.
11
It’s difficult to make plans when you are
too depressed to get out of bed. Force yourself. As the Bible says, “Take up your
bed and walk.” Do it. Distract yourself. Call friends. Visit neighbors. Go
somewhere to worship. Play cards or other games. Memorize poetry or historic
events. Learn to draw or to play the guitar. Listen to music. Dance. Sing. Do
crossword puzzles. Get a dog or cat or bird. Take that vacation you have always
thought about. Write out your plans for the future. Use deep breathing and/or
other relaxation techniques. Do anything that forces you to concentrate your
attention, particularly things that you do well.
Why? Because the despair of unrequited love is most likely associated with
plummeting levels of dopamine. As you focus your attention and do novel
things, you elevate this feel-good substance, boosting energy and hope.
Exercise is particularly good for rejected lovers. Every time you slump into a
chair, sit by the phone, or stare out the window, you give your departed
sweetheart time to stoke the fire in your aching heart. Exercise can starve the
flame. Any kind of physical exertion will elevate your mood.
12 Jogging, biking,
and other forms of strenuous physical activity are known to drive up levels of
dopamine in the nucleus accumbens of the brain, bestowing feelings of
euphoria.
13 Exercise also elevates serotonin and some of the endorphins, calming
substances. And it increases BDNF (brain-derived neurotropic factor) in the
hippocampus, the memory center, which protects and makes new nerve cells. In
fact, some psychiatrists believe that exercise (aerobic or anaerobic) can be as
effective in healing depression as psychotherapy or antidepressant drugs.
14
Sunlight is another tonic for depressed lovers.
15
It stimulates the pineal gland
in the brain, which regulates bodily rhythms in ways that often elevate mood. So
pick a daily activity you can do in daylight, preferably out of doors.
To risk sounding like Ben Franklin in his Poor Richard’s Almanac, I’ll add
these thoughts for a depressed lover: avoid sweets or drugs that you know will
stress your body and your mind. Count your blessings; optimism heals. Walk
with the ancient human stride (as discussed in chapter six); it’s graceful and easy
on your muscles—and probably your brain. And smile; put on a happy face even
as you cry inside. The nerves of these facial muscles activate nerve pathways in
the brain that can give you feelings of pleasure.
16 Even imagining that you are
happy can spur pleasurable brain activity.
“Stay me with apples; comfort me with flagons / For I am sick with love,”
cried the lover in the Song of Songs. I suspect forlorn lovers sought distractions
and daylight, made up soothing maxims, took herbal remedies, exercised, and
smiled to alleviate love sickness a million years ago.
The “12-Sep” Approach: Love Addicts
One way to meet new people, learn new coping mechanisms, and develop a
fresh perspective on life and love is to join a “12-Step” program. This innovative
movement began in the 1930s when two Americans, “Bill W.” and “Dr. Bob,”
agreed to conquer their addiction to alcohol by speaking with each other any
time of the day or night they felt the urge to drink. Building on these exchanges,
they created the principles and rituals of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). Today
this shrewd formula for kicking addiction has spawned over a hundred similar
kinds of groups, from Gamblers Anonymous, to Over-Eaters Anonymous, to Sex
and Love Addicts Anonymous (SLAA). Each group follows the same 12-Step
design for living—an ingenious array of slogans, principles, and practices that
have helped addicts around the world recover.
“One day at a time” is a basic tenet. To members of AA, it is unrealistic—if
not impossible—to consider giving up alcohol for the rest of one’s life, but one
can resist the demon hour by hour. “Just for today,” they say, “I will not drink.”
In the same vein, the chocoholic decides not to reach for a chocolate bar today.
Gamblers decide not to bet today. And the rejected lover can decide not to
contact the beloved—today.
“If you don’t want to slip, don’t go into slippery places” is another 12-Step
slogan. Applied to the love addict, it means: stay out of the restaurants where
you and your lover dined. Go someplace new to shop or get your exercise. Don’t
play the songs you used to share. Avoid the “people, places, and things” that
trigger a desire for your wayward partner.
Another maxim is, “It’s the first drink that gets you drunk.” In short, addicts
know that when they have their first martini or chocolate donut, they will surely
have a second and a third. In like manner, don’t make that first phone call, write
that first e-mail, or drive past his or her house that first time. One contact with
the rejecting sweetheart will inevitably lead to more contacts—and more misery.
Perhaps the most intriguing slogan is “Think the drink through.” To
members of Alcoholics Anonymous, this means that as you stand at an elegant
wedding reception and gaze at all the pretty people sipping glasses of
champagne, think past this genteel moment to its possible end: a devastating
bender that could last for months. In the same manner, the jilted lover tends to
romanticize the glory days. So they pick up the phone and make contact with
their rejecting sweetheart with these magnificent memories in mind. Think past
those joyous moments to some horrible weekend when your “true love” never
called.
“In a net I seek to hold the wind,” wrote the Italian poet Petrarch.
17 He knew
how impossible it is to retrieve a departed lover. Better to give up the drug and
rebuild your life. And remember: your former lover won’t help you. Most feel
morally blameless, yet guilty for hurting you.
18 But they do not know how to
handle your grief or their own feelings about the ruptured tie.
19 So although they
may be friendly if you contact them, most will be perplexed, annoyed, even
angry that you have intruded on their new life.
Taking Antidepressants
“I turn you out of doors / tenant desire You pay no rent I turn you out of doors All
my best rooms are yours The brain and heart Depart. I turn you out of doors
Switch off the lights Throw water on the fire I turn you out of doors Stubborn
desire.”
20 The fifteenth-century French poet Alain Chartier knew that feelings of
romantic love can take up stubborn residence in the mind. And when things go
sour, you must turn them out.
Modern medicine can help.
There are many different types of depression. The woman suffering from
postpartum blues is not experiencing exactly the same kind of depression as the
man who just got fired. Rejected love may provoke yet another form of
depression, with a specific chemical fingerprint in the brain. Moreover, people
mired in the initial “protest stage” of rejected love are suffering different
symptoms than those who have given up hope entirely.
Nevertheless, all forms of “clinical” depression seem to manifest themselves
with four basic symptoms. Cognitive impairments include lack of concentration
on business as usual, the inability to remember daily events or duties, obsessive
thinking about your problems and your pain, and other abnormalities of thinking.
Mood is altered; depressed men and women struggle with despair, anxiety, fear,
anger, and/or other disabling mood states. Bodily problems arise; depressed
people generally have trouble eating, sleeping, or engaging in sexual play. And
many contemplate suicide.
Rejected men and women often express all these symptoms of major
depression. Unable to cope, many turn to antidepressant medications to relieve
their anguish. Currently the most popular are pills that increase brain levels of
serotonin in one way or another. The most common ones are the selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs. Today serotonin-enhancing medications
are a $12 billion industry in the United States alone. Some 7.1 million
Americans take some version of serotonin booster to counter depression, stress,
bereavement, or the despair of tragic love.
21
As the drug takes effect, the physical and psychic pain of utter sorrow begins
to dissipate. You spend less time staring at the wall in what psychiatrists call a
“vegetative state.” You begin to sleep through the night, eat breakfast, lunch, and
dinner, and go about your business in a more timely and effective manner.
Eventually the incessant reflecting diminishes. You become less impulsively
drawn to contact “him” or “her.” And feelings of rage, despair, and longing
interrupt your thinking less and less. These medications even repair some of the
physical damage that has occurred. They stimulate the growth of nerve cells in
the hippocampus, the brain’s memory center, thereby reversing the harm often
caused by prolonged stress.
22
But these serotonin-boosting drugs often have adverse side effects. Some
people gain weight. An estimated 70 percent of patients taking these medications
suffer diminished libido, delayed sexual arousal, and/or the inability to achieve
erection, ejaculation, or orgasm.
23 And these drugs can often induce apathy, what
psychiatrists call “emotional blunting.”
All these side effects are worth enduring, of course, if you feel you may kill
yourself or someone else. However, it might be wise to periodically reassess
your condition and consider supplementing your antidepressant medication with
one that raises levels of dopamine, even switching to a dopamine enhancer.
There are several on the market. These dopamine-elevating substances are not as
predictable in lifting suicidal depression, but for many patients they work.
24 And
unlike the serotonin-enhancing medications, they do not produce weight gain or
lower sex drive. Indeed, patients regularly report that their sex drive increases.
25
More important to our story, when rejected lovers take an antidepressant that
elevates dopamine levels in the brain, they are replenishing the very substance
the lack of which is most likely causing their withdrawal symptoms.
Estradiol (an estrogen) has antidepressant effects, as do testosterone and
thyroid hormone.
26 Substance P seems to work as an antidepressant. I suspect an
opioid antagonist might alleviate some of the craving of romantic love.
Moreover, medications that block corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), the
brain hormone released during stress, may soon come on the market to relieve
chronic sorrow. These and other new drugs promise to relieve melancholy.
Of course, no antidepressant medication will relieve every patient. Users
must work with their doctors to find what is right for them. Moreover, none of
these drugs entirely conquers the agony of lost love. And they all have side
effects of one kind or another. But if they may not prove a magic bullet in every
case, these chemical products are a far better alternative than stalking a former
lover in your car, sobbing uncontrollably in the dark, or sitting stupefied before
the TV set, awash in rage and sorrow. And anything beats suicide.
“Talking Therapy”
“For use can almost change the stamp of nature,” Shakespeare wrote in Hamlet.
What wisdom. Talking about your predicament with a therapist, and thereby
modifying the ways you think and act, can change your brain activity. Studies
show that psychotherapy can produce many of the same changes in brain
function that antidepressant medications produce.
27
In fact, sometimes “talking
therapy” can be just as effective at alleviating major depression.
28
In one telling study, scientists compared twenty-four untreated adults
suffering from the apathy, melancholy, and hopelessness of major depression
with sixteen adults with no psychiatric problems. First each person’s brain was
scanned, using an fMRI machine. The depressed men and women showed
abnormally increased activity in parts of the prefrontal cortex, the caudate, and
the thalamus (a relay station of the brain); the controls did not. Then ten of the
despondent subjects were administered the antidepressant paroxetine, which
elevates serotonin levels. The other depressed participants attended twelve
psychotherapy sessions instead. Then all of the depressed patients had their
brains scanned again. Following both forms of treatment, activity was reduced in
those brain regions that had shown abnormal activation.
29
Interestingly, those who underwent the psychotherapy got a bonus. These
men and women registered significant new activity in regions of the insula that
can inhibit feelings of depression.
30
Rather than measuring out the merits of talking therapy versus drug
treatment, many psychiatrists now believe that the combination of talking
therapy and antidepressant medications is more effective than either treatment by
itself.
Time to Heal
“All things flow; nothing abides,” wrote the Roman philosopher Heraclitus. As
you remove the stimuli that fan your ardor, arm yourself with a battery of
slogans, build new daily habits, meet new people, take up new interests, and
perhaps find the right antidepressant medication and/or the right therapist or
guide, your addiction to a former lover will eventually subside. We heal.
Sometimes it takes a few weeks. More normally it takes months. Often it takes
more than two years of separation. But some glorious morning you will notice
that you haven’t thought of your hurtful partner in a week or more. Your enemy
is no longer lodging in your head.
31
People never forget a true love, of course. Despite his devotion to his wife,
Martha, George Washington preserved a lifelong passion for another man’s wife,
Sally Fairfax. Historians believe America’s first president never kissed Sally, nor
was he rejected by her. They were friends. But Washington adored her. He wrote
to Sally some twenty-five years after their last encounter, saying that none of the
great events of his career, “nor all of them together, have been able to eradicate
from my mind those happy moments, the happiest of my life, which I have
enjoyed in your company.”

In a similar vein, Su Tung-Po, a Chinese poet of the eleventh century, wrote,
“Year after year I recall that moonlit night we spent alone together / among hills
of stunted pine.”
33
“We know well only what we are deprived of,” wrote French author Francois
Mauriac. No one forgets. Nevertheless, even those who have been brutally
tossed aside begin to lose their feelings of agony, bitterness, and disappointment.
You can speed your recovery; but it does take determination, sometimes
medication and/or therapy, and what Shakespeare called “the inaudible and
noiseless foot of Time.”
34
But of all the cures for a bad romance, by far the most effective is to find a
new lover to fill your heart. “A new love drives out the old.” Nothing has
changed since the twelfth-century French cleric Andreas Capellanus wrote these
words. Modern science agrees. As you fall in love again, you elevate levels of
dopamine and other feel-good chemicals in your brain.
Can We Conjure Love?
Dear Helen, I just turned 70 and have fallen in love again with a wonderful man who thinks the
world of me but confesses not to love me. We have wonderful times together when we have the time
(he’s still in business). My question to you is do you think it’s possible for someone to fall in love
with you after a year of being together. He thinks I’m wonderful and all those good things but he
was so hurt by his last broken marriage he says he doesn’t know if he could fall in love again. My
feeling is, you don’t have a choice. I would love to hear from you because my heart is just breaking
and I don’t know what to do. J.C.
I received this e-mail recently from a woman in Canada. I wrote back to say I
thought she could win the love of her man—with a little work.
How do you ignite mad romantic passion in another?
Do novel things together.
Laboratory experiments have confirmed that exciting experiences can
enhance feelings of attraction. The classic study of this, done by psychologists
Donald Dutton and Art Aron, is known as the “creaky bridge” experiment.
35
Two walking bridges span the Capilano Canyon in North Van-couver; one is
a flimsy suspension bridge that is five feet wide and sways and wobbles some
230 feet above the jagged boulders and river rapids. Upstream is a steady, broad,
low bridge. Dutton and Aron asked dozens of men to cross either one bridge or
the other. In the middle of each bridge stood a beautiful young woman (part of
their research team) who asked each passing man to fill out a questionnaire.
After each man completed the survey queries, she casually told him that if he
had any further questions about the study, he should call her at her home. She
gave each her telephone number. None knew the woman was part of the
experiment.
Nine out of thirty-two men who walked the narrow, wobbly high bridge were
attracted enough to call the woman in her home. Only two of those who met her
on the low, solid bridge contacted her.
This spontaneous attraction is probably directly linked to a physical property
of danger: danger stimulates the production of adrenaline, a bodily stimulant
closely related to dopamine and norepinephrine. As psychologist Elaine Hatfield
surmised, “Adrenaline makes the heart grow fonder.”
36
I would add that danger
is novel to most of us. And, as mentioned, novelty elevates levels of dopamine—
the chemical associated with romantic love. The men on the high, scary bridge
may have also experienced elevated concentrations of this stimulant.
Several studies show that couples who do exciting things together feel more
satisfaction in their relationship.
37 But in another experiment Art Aron and
another colleague, Christina Norman, showed that exciting activities actually
stimulate romantic love as well. They asked twenty-eight dating and married
couples to fill out various questionnaires, then do an activity together, then fill
out more questionnaires. One activity was exciting; the other dull. The
experiment with each couple took about an hour. Interestingly, questionnaire
responses indicated that the couples who did the exciting activity (as opposed to
the boring task) experienced increased feelings of relationship satisfaction—and
more intense feelings of romantic love.
38
Perhaps my e-mail friend in Canada and other courting women and men who
want to trigger romantic love in a partner should invite the slowpoke to join
them in exciting, somewhat risky situations. Maybe visiting a foreign city
together or walking along a perilous mountain trail would galvanize romantic
passion. I recently saw a man and woman tied together with “bungee” cords
plunge off a ledge atop a two-hundred-foot-high crane. When they landed they
were locked in tight embrace. I don’t recommend it. But how about trying a new
restaurant in a different part of town, buying last-minute tickets to the theater or
a sports event, dashing off to a parade, or swimming after dark. Anything
rousing and unusual can potentially trigger romantic love.
Even arguments can be exciting—and potentially romantic. I am not in favor
of fighting with a true love. But some couples report that arguments enliven the
relationship. Inanna, queen of ancient Sumeria, first fell in love with Dumuzi
during a row. As a poem of the times recorded, “From the starting of the quarrel
/ Came the lovers’ desire.”
39 With quarrels, grievances get aired, often removed;
then partners must use some creativity to reknit the bond. More important, anger
revs up the mind and body, triggering the release of adrenaline and other
stimulants that are associated with romantic passion.
“Love is a canvas furnished by Nature and embroidered by the imagination,”
Voltaire wrote. Embroider life with novelty and adventure. You may win your
love.
Sexual Intimacy
Sex can also spark romantic ardor.
Sex is good for you, if you are with someone you are fond of, the time is
right, and you enjoy this form of exercise and self-expression. Stroking and
massage trigger the production of oxytocin and the endorphins, brain chemicals
that can relax and produce feelings of attachment.
40 Sex helps you keep your
skin, muscles, and other bodily tissues in tone. It offers the opportunity to create
novelty and excitement. And with orgasm, the brain releases oxytocin in women
and vasopressin in men—chemicals associated with feelings of attachment. But
sex is not only good for relaxation, muscle tone, and giving and receiving
pleasure; it is often associated with elevated levels of testosterone. And
testosterone can promote the production of dopamine, the liquor that fuels
romance.
Curiously, even seminal fluid can potentially contribute to romantic passion.
Psychologist Gordon Gallup and his collaborators report that this broth that
surrounds sperm contains dopamine and norepinephrine, as well as tyrosine, an
amino acid the brain needs to manufacture dopamine.
41 This ejaculate also
contains testosterone, which can elevate the sex drive; various estrogens, which
aid feminine sexual arousal and orgasm; and oxytocin and vasopressin, which
encourage feelings of union with a partner. It even deposits follicle-stimulating
hormone and luteinizing hormone in the vaginal canal, substances women use to
regulate menstrual cycling. Not all these substances can march directly from the
bloodstream into brain tissue; some cannot cross the blood-brain barrier. Yet all
can potentially contribute to feelings of romance in one way or another.
Gallup and his students Rebecca Burch and Steven Platek have determined
that seminal fluid also alleviates depressive symptoms in women.
42 This could
occur for several reasons. Seminal fluid contains beta-endorphins, substances
that can reach the brain directly and calm the mind and body. But as you may
have noticed, male seminal fluid also contains the essential ingredients for all
three of the basic mating drives discussed in this book—lust, romantic love, and
male-female attachment. No wonder women are less depressed when they make
love and receive this fluid; perhaps they may even become more receptive to
romance.
“Exuberance is beauty,” wrote William Blake. Both sexes are attracted to
happy partners. This may be because we naturally mimic those around us. When
another smiles, we unconsciously smile too, albeit sometimes fleetingly. And
smiling moves specific muscles in the face that send nerve signals to the brain
that stimulate the brain networks for pleasure.
43 So as you concoct novel,
adventurous, and sexy things to do with someone you would like to win as a
romantic partner, put on a happy face. You may trigger feelings of pleasure in
your lover—and start that primordial romantic blaze.
Reassess Your Antidepressant Medications
Before you begin courting in earnest, you should reassess the effectiveness of
any antidepressant medication you may be taking—particularly if you are
experiencing sexual side effects or emotional blunting.
I say this for an important reason: as you know, the brain networks for lust,
romantic love, and attachment interact in complex ways. So my colleague,
psychiatrist Andy Thomson, and I believe that artificially elevating serotonin
activity can endanger your ability to fall in love. As you know, romantic love is
associated with elevated levels of dopamine and possibly also norepinephrine.
These neurotransmitters generally have a negative relationship with serotonin.
So as you artificially raise brain levels of serotonin with pills, you potentially
inhibit production, distribution, and/or expression of dopamine and
norepinephrine—and jeopardize your ability to fall in love.
44
Andy points out that artificially elevated levels of serotonin can imperil your
ability to appraise suitors, choose appropriate mates, and form and maintain
stable partnerships as well.
45
For example, most of these drugs blunt the emotions. When you are terribly
depressed over a busted romance, you seek this effect. But as men and women
continue to use these antidepressants long after their love affair is over, they can
block their ability to respond when the perfect new partner appears. They are too
emotionally dull to notice “him” or “her.”
The first direct evidence of this “courtship blunting” has now been found.
Psychologist Maryanne Fisher asked women taking SSRIs and women taking no
medications to rate the attractiveness of men’s faces in photographs. Sure
enough, the women taking the serotonin boosters rated the male faces as more
unattractive than the others did; the medicated women also looked at and
appraised the male faces for a shorter time.
46
Serotonin enhancers also dampen the sex drive and inhibit the sex response
(including ejaculation) in many users.
47 As a result, people taking these pills
often shy away from potential romantic alliances; they are afraid of failure in the
bedroom. Hence they forgo the stroking, kissing, and lovemaking that can
trigger romantic love. They miss orgasm’s rush of oxytocin and vasopressin that
can produce feelings of attachment. And men who can’t ejaculate fail to deposit
chemicals of their seminal fluid that could influence their partner’s mood.
These serotonin-elevating drugs have even more hidden negative effects.
Female orgasm most likely evolved to suit many purposes. But scientists have
long thought it emerged, at least in part, to distinguish Mr. Right from Mr.
Wrong. This “fickle” orgasmic response helped ancestral women recognize
lovers who were willing to commit valuable time and energy to pleasing them. It
still does. So women taking serotonin-enhancing medications jeopardize their
ability to assess the emotional commitment of a partner. Perhaps worse, many
people taking serotonin-enhancing medications send faulty signals of ineptness
and lack of interest in the bedroom that can repel a potential mate. They are also
likely to mistakenly conclude that they, themselves, are not compatible with this
partner. In fact, they are just drugged.
People on serotonin-enhancing antidepressant medications potentially
jeopardize their ability to assess mates, trigger romance, and form attachments—
altering their love lives and the future of their genes.
Male Intimacy; Female Intimacy
“Yet mark’d I where the bolt of cupid fell: It fell upon a little western flower,
Before milk-white, now purple with love’s wound, And maidens call it love-inidleness. Fetch me that flower; the herb I shew’d thee once: The juice of it on
sleeping eye-lids laid Will make or man or woman madly dote / Upon the next
live creature that it sees.” Oberon, King of the Fairies in Shakespeare’s A
Midsummer Night’s Dream, tells of a potent blossom that would make you fall in
love.
How many million men and women throughout human evolution have
yearned to find such a flower? Alas, it does not exist. Even taking pills (or street
drugs like cocaine or amphetamines) that raise levels of dopamine in the brain
won’t make someone fall in love with you if he or she is not ready or is looking
for an entirely different kind of partner. But if a credible suitor has expressed
some interest in you, there are still other ways to stimulate their interest, and
their heart—using what is known of gender differences in the brain.
Intimacy is popular these days. Many—not only in the United States but in
societies as diverse as Mexico, India, and China—regard this sense of closeness
and sharing as central to romantic love.
48 But men and women often define and
express this closeness differently.
Both genders think shared personal secrets and happy activities together are
intimate.
49 But women often regard intimacy as talking face-to-face, while men
tend to feel emotionally close when they work or play or talk side by side.
50
Indeed, men often feel mildly threatened or challenged when they look directly
into another’s eyes. So they sit at angles and avoid looking directly at a
companion.
51 This response probably stems from men’s ancestry. For many
millennia men faced their enemies; they sat or walked side by side as they
hunted game with friends.
Smart women appreciate this gender difference. To achieve intimacy with a
male partner they do things side by side, such as walking in the woods or mall,
driving in a car, sitting in a movie house, or snuggling up to watch TV—beside
him.
Most men also derive intimacy from playing or watching sports. From
millions of years of tracking, surrounding, and felling animals, men have
become, on average, more spatially adept than women—a form of intelligence
linked to the male hormone testosterone.
52 So when a woman joins a man to ski,
climb mountains, play chess, or cheer at a tennis match or football game, he may
feel particularly drawn to her.
53
Women derive tremendous closeness from talking face-to-face.
54 They sit
closer than men do, and they look directly into another’s eyes with what linguist
Deborah Tannen calls the “anchoring gaze.”
55 This taste probably also harks
back to yesteryear when ancestral women held their infants in front of their
faces, educating, soothing, and entertaining their little ones with words. So if you
are a savvy man and you find yourself sitting on a park bench with a woman
who is twisting her feet, knees, hips, chest, shoulders, neck, and face to look into
your face, swivel around and look directly at her as you speak. When you look
straight ahead and avoid her eyes, she feels you are evading her. By returning her
anchoring gaze you give her the primordial feminine gift of intimacy. You may
also ignite romantic longing.
Courting Talk
If men like sports events and other activities that emphasize their spatial skills,
women like words. Little girls speak sooner than boys, with greater grammatical
accuracy and more words per utterance. In societies around the world women
are, on average, more linguistically gifted than men—probably because words
have been women’s tools for raising young for at least a million years.
56
In fact,
women’s verbal ability is even linked with the female hormone estrogen.
So smart men court with words—on the phone, on a date, on the pillow. A
friend of mine recently told me she fell madly in love with the man who became
her husband when he started to send her his (terrible) poetry. Men don’t need
linguistic talent; they just need courage and words.
Women and men generally achieve intimacy by talking about different
subjects, however. Many men enjoy talking about sports, politics, world affairs,
and business. These are worlds of win or lose, of top dogs and underdogs, of
status and hierarchy, worlds men understand because men have always jockeyed
for status to win mates.
57 Women, on the other hand, are more drawn to emotionladen, self-revealing chat about personal issues and other people,
58 probably
because women evolved in an ancestral environment where social connections
were crucial to survival.
Men and women become more alike in their middle age,
59 probably in part
because levels of estrogen decline in women and levels of testosterone decline in
men.
60 But regardless of age, observant suitors diligently engage in
conversations that will captivate a lover, hoping to promote closeness that could
kindle romantic love.
Sex as Intimacy
Sex, too, can lead to intimacy—and potentially trigger the ecstasy of romance.
Men are about four times more likely than women to equate sexual activity with
emotional closeness.
61 This male perspective has Darwinian logic. Coitus is a
man’s ticket to posterity; if his partner gets pregnant she will send his DNA into
the future. So although men often have no conscious interest in making babies,
this evolutionary payoff seems to have bred into the male psyche an unconscious
tendency to regard sexual intercourse as the essence of intimacy, affection, and
companionship.
Women report that they feel more intimacy with a partner when they talk
together just before making love.
62 Women probably derive intimacy from
precoital chat because it shows that their lover can listen, be patient and
supportive, and contain his lust, attributes ancestral women needed in a mate.
Any way you look at it, sex is immensely memorable and satisfying when
things go right. And those who adroitly conduct the sexual aspects of a
relationship have a potent arrow in their quiver for stimulating romantic love.
Buying Time
We all know that women are attracted to men who have resources and
generously share their money, time, connections, and status with a mating
partner. So all those flowers, chocolates, and theater tickets might indeed topple
her head over heels in love. And as you recall, men are quite drawn to women
they feel they need to save.
63 So women, often unconsciously, say and do things
that display their vulnerability, what I call the “broken wing” strategy. Sure
enough, this neediness often triggers gallantry and romance in men.
Vulnerability is just about the last thing men like to display.
64 Why show
your weaknesses when you can flaunt your strengths and accomplishments
instead? Men do that. They brag. And women listen. Although women are often
appalled at these bald displays of puffery, they are also impressed. So like
womanly exhibitions of helplessness, men’s cocky boasting may help spark that
fire in the heart.
Oscar Wilde once wrote, “The essence of romance is uncertainty.” It was a
clever observation. We walk a fine line when we woo. If you are too eager, an
undecided suitor may flee. Biology probably plays a role in this behavior. Early
acquisition of a reward reduces the duration and intensity of dopamine activity in
the brain, while a delay in winning stimulates it.
65 As a result, people who are
“hard to get” tend to excite a suitor. Andreas Capellanus knew this long ago,
reminding troubadours of twelfth-century France that “love easily obtained is of
little value; difficulty in obtaining it makes it precious.”
66 So those who want to
trigger romance in a would-be lover might artfully create some mystery, barriers,
and uncertainty in the relationship.
I know all this sounds like playing games. But love is a game, nature’s only
game. Just about every creature on this planet plays it—unconsciously scheming
to pass their DNA into tomorrow. By counting children, nature keeps her score.
Making Yourself Fall in Love
What would have happened if Shakespeare’s Oberon had sprinkled the juice of
that “little western flower” in his own eyes? Most of us have met someone we
admired and enjoyed. He or she was kind, generous, honest, happy, ambitious,
humorous, successful, attractive, interesting, and amorous in ways that suited us.
Yet we couldn’t conjure up that magic feeling for him or her. Can you make
yourself fall in love?
Well, you can certainly try. Find things you really like to do with your
admirer. Make them novel and exciting. Dismiss distractions, particularly other
lovers. And genuinely open yourself to his or her way of thinking, feeling, and
making love. You just may be able to stimulate in yourself the appropriate brain
circuits for romantic love.
Psychologist Robert Epstein is trying to do just that. Editor in chief of
Psychology Today and author of eleven books and dozens of scholarly articles,
Epstein recently ran an editorial in his magazine advertising for a woman who
would date him exclusively with the express intent of falling madly in love. He
hoped the process would last six months to a year and end in marriage.
67 Epstein
outlined several stipulations. Among them, both would seek regular counseling
together; both would read extensively about love in novels and nonfiction books;
both would keep a daily diary and do various exercises (such as synchronous
breathing); and both would actively seek to know the other thoroughly.
Epstein believes you can learn to fall in love. Many of those who enter
arranged marriages or procure mail-order brides also seem to believe you can
jump-start this magic. I do, too. If you pick someone who is ready to fall in love
and fits within your love map, and if you keep your heart open and do novel
things together, you may just activate the brain network for romantic passion.
The juice of Cupid’s “little western flower” is creativity and determination.
Why Romantic Passion Recedes with Time
“There lives within the very flame of love / A kind of wick or snuff that will
abate it,” Shakespeare said. Romantic love often recedes with time.
In the beginning, you spend weeks or months wooing with long e-mails,
intimate conversations, shared adventures at restaurants, concerts, parties, and
sports events, and joyous times in bed. You work endlessly to impress and charm
your beloved. At times you feel such ecstasy you can’t sleep. Then as the months
turn into years, your romantic bliss begins to ripen into a deeper union: longterm attachment. Romantic fervor continues in some long relationships.
68 And
this passion can still become intense during vacations and at other times of
novelty and adventure. But the wild ecstasy, fierce energy, and obsessive
thinking generally diminish, giving way to feelings of safety and contentment.
Exactly how the brain quells the early storm of romantic passion is unknown.
One of three things might occur: Either brain regions that produce and transport
dopamine (and probably norepinephrine) begin to distribute less of their
stimulant. Or the receptor sites for these chemicals that reside at nerve endings
gradually become desensitized.
69 Or other chemicals in the brain begin to mask
or counteract the chemistry of this passion. But whatever the biological cause,
the body gradually settles down.
This decline of romantic love is undoubtedly evolution’s doing. Intense
romantic passion consumes enormous time and energy. And it would be
decidedly disruptive to one’s peace of mind and daily activities (including
rearing children) to spend years obsessively doting on a lover. Instead, this brain
circuitry evolved primarily for one purpose: to drive our forebears to seek and
find special mating partners, then copulate exclusively with “him” or “her” until
conception was assured. At that point, ancestral couples needed to stop focussing
on each other and start building a safe social world where they could rear their
precious child together. Nature gave us passion. Then she gave us peace—until
we fall in love again.
Making Romance Last
Still, some people do remain passionately in love for a lifetime.
70 Some couples
married more than twenty years report that they are still in love.
71
In fact, in one
remarkable survey, men and women married more than twenty years tested
higher on romantic passion for one another than did those married only five
years.
72 Their scores looked much like those of high school seniors.
73
I met such a couple recently. At a business dinner I found myself sitting
beside a handsome, bright, affable, middle-aged president of a major American
nonprofit organization. When he discovered that I was writing a book about
romantic love, he told me he was still “in love” with his wife; they had been
married twenty-six years. The following month I was fortunate enough to meet
his spouse, a woman of elegance and literature. Unaware of my conversation
with her husband, she avowed that she was still very much in love with her mate.
So when her husband joined us, I took the liberty of asking both of them how
they had kept their passion percolating.
She said, “Humor.” He said, “Sex.”
I was not surprised with either answer. Humor is based on novelty, the
unexpected—which elevates levels of dopamine in the brain. And sex is
associated with elevated levels of testosterone, which, in a chain reaction, can
increase dopamine as well. But I suspect this charismatic couple kept love alive
in another way as well. Both had exceptionally exciting careers and did many
unusual things together. I think their lifestyle stimulated dopamine levels and
maintained romantic passion.
“It is not customary to love what one has,” wrote Anatole France. To
counteract this conventional thinking, therapists advise people to follow several
standard practices: Commit. Listen “actively” to your partner. Ask questions.
Give answers. Appreciate. Stay attractive. Keep growing intellectually. Include
her. Give him privacy. Be honest and trustworthy. Tell your mate what you need.
Accept his/her shortcomings. Mind your manners. Exercise your sense of humor.
Respect him. Respect her. Compromise. Argue constructively. Never threaten to
depart. Forget the past. Say “no” to adultery. Don’t assume the relationship will
last forever; build it one day at a time. And never give up.
These and many other wise habits can sustain feelings of long-term
attachment. But none is likely to elevate levels of dopamine or maintain
romantic passion. Other tactics, however, can keep this flame burning.
“Let there be spaces in your togetherness,” advised Kahlil Gibran. Although
the Lebanese poet probably didn’t know it, this was good advice for sustaining
the biology associated with romantic love. As mentioned earlier, when a reward
is delayed in coming, the tardy delivery prolongs the activity of dopamine cells
—speeding more of this natural stimulant into reward centers of the brain.
74
Although men appreciate privacy and autonomy more than women do, for both
sexes “space” probably helps sustain romantic passion.
Given what we know of love, surely it would also be wise to engage in what
therapists call “dating time.” Develop an array of common interests and make a
point of doing novel and exciting things together.
75 Variety, variety, variety: it
stimulates the pleasure centers of the brain,
76 maintaining the climate of
romance.
Passion and Reason
Since the time of the ancient Greeks, poets, philosophers, and dramatists have
regarded passion and reason as separate, distinct, even opposing phenomena.
Plato summed up the dichotomy, saying that one’s desires were like wild horses;
the intellect was the “charioteer” who must subdue and direct these cravings.
77
The belief that one must employ reason to triumph over one’s baser drives has
trickled through the centuries. Early Christian theologians cemented this precept
in Western thought: emotions and desires were temptations, sins that must be
conquered by reasoning and willpower.
Neuroscientists now believe, however, that reason and passion are inexorably
linked in the brain. And I think these connections say something important about
controlling romantic love.
As you might remember, the prefrontal cortex of the brain lies directly
behind your forehead; it expanded dramatically in size during human prehistory
and is devoted to processing information. This is the business center of the mind.
With the prefrontal cortex (and its connections) you collect and order data
acquired through the senses, then analyze and weigh these details, reason, plan,
and make decisions. But the prefrontal cortex has direct connections with many
subcortical brain regions, including an emotion center, the amygdala, and a
center for motivation, the caudate, as well as others. Hence thinking, feeling,
memory, and motivation are closely integrated.
78 Reason and passion are
inseparably linked.
In fact, one rarely has a thought without an accompanying feeling and urge;
and one rarely has a feeling or want without an accompanying thought. For good
reason, says neuroscientist Antonio Damasio. Without emotions and wants, we
could not assign different values to different options. Our thoughts, our
reasoning, our decisions would be flat, cold-blooded, lacking the vital emotional
components we need to weigh variables and make choices.
79 We would be “souls
on ice.”
80
Neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux has even discovered that the brain has two
highways for integrating emotions and reasoning: the “high road” and the “low
road.”
81 And both are connected to the reward system in the brain, with its wants
and drives. When the amygdala receives signals directly from the prefrontal
cortex we control ourselves. We think before we feel and act. This is the “high
road.” But the amygdala also receives data directly from sensory regions of the
cortex that bypass the prefrontal cortex, the reasoning part of the brain. This is
the “low road”; it is irrational, powerfully emotional, much larger than the “high
road,” and very difficult to curb. This “low road” enables the lover to experience
tremendous ecstasy and yearning when they see a beloved, even before they
rationally think about “him” or “her.” But the “low road” can engulf the
disappointed lover in unthinking, out-of-control rage as well—provoking them to
impulsively shout at, hit, even slaughter a sweetheart.
There is a silver lining to this brain wiring. We humans can take the “high
road.” The prefrontal cortex can and often does exercise control over the
amygdala and the rest of the evolutionarily older brain systems that generate our
emotions and urges.
82 As philosopher John Dewey said, “Mind is primarily a
verb.” I agree. The human prefrontal cortex, the crowning achievement of life on
earth, is built to do things—to assemble data in unique ways, reason, make
decisions, and override our basic drives. As Aristotle put it, “The brain tempers
the heat and seething of the heart.”
We can control the drive to love.
How will this powerful, mercurial, primordial force fare in our modern
world?

“The Madness of the Gods”: The Triumph of Love
Love—thou art deep—
I cannot cross thee—
But, were there Two
Instead of One—
Rower, and Yacht—some sovereign Summer
Who knows—but we’d reach the Sun?
Emily Dickinson
“Love Thou Art High”
“These days nothing is impossible in this world. A person can do anything. I
offer a prayer today to Shree Pashupatibaba that just as our love develops more
and more fully, so too may it grow and develop fully in the future, may it be able
to blossom and blossom.” Vajra Bahadur wrote these words to Shila in a village
in Nepal in the 1990s. It is one of hundreds of love letters that anthropologist
Laura Ahearn collected when she lived in this community some hundred miles
southwest of Katmandu.
1
For centuries, Nepalese parents had arranged their children’s marriages
according to complex kin and caste connections. Often the bride and groom
spoke for the first time on their wedding day. But along with electricity, Hindi
romances in the movie hall, education, and literacy has come a new tradition:
love letters. And since 1993, 90 percent of all who married eloped with someone
they adored.
As trade, industry, communication, and education have seeped around the
globe, many other men and women have shed their custom of arranged
marriages to choose partners they love.
2 As you may recall, in a recent study of
thirty-seven societies, from Brazil to Nigeria to Indonesia, men and women
ranked love, or mutual attraction, as the primary criterion for choosing a spouse.
3
Only in India, Pakistan, and some other Muslim countries, parts of sub-Saharan
Africa, and a few other places where poverty is rife and the extended family is
crucial to survival, do over 50 percent of men and women still marry at their
parents’ bidding.
4 Even in these places, betrothed partners meet before their
wedding day to approve or reject the match.
5
Not all of these arranged marriages are loveless.
On the contrary, in India people commonly say, “First we marry, then we fall
in love.”
6 But most men and women around the world today choose their
partners for themselves, what the Chinese call “free love.”
The Re-emergence of Romantic Love
The rise of romantic love in marriage, the ubiquitous celebration of this passion
in movies, plays, poems, songs, and books, the worldwide flood of discussions
about romance on television and radio, and the belief that romantic love is the
foundation stone of male-female partnerships is the result of many social trends.
But a few are particularly important. One is the ascent of individual autonomy
and the concomitant surge of women into the paid labor market.
For millions of years our forebears lived in small hunting and gathering
bands. Both sexes worked. As men “commuted” to do their hunting, women
hiked far afield to gather vegetables and fruits—and women provided some 60 to
80 percent of the daily sustenance. Charismatic men, and probably some forceful
older women, led the band. And tradition bound all to myriad social rules. But
men and women were free to make most of their own personal decisions;
individuals were relatively autonomous.
Life in contemporary hunting/gathering societies suggests that ancestral
parents (to serve their social purposes) often chose their daughter’s first
husband
7 Their obligations met, however, they put little pressure on the
youngsters to sustain the match. Most of these betrothals failed. Then divorcees
picked a second and often a third mate for themselves—because they could.
Women were powerful, economically, sexually, and socially. And when spouses
found that they could not live harmoniously together, each could afford to part.
For millions of years our ancestors largely wed for love.
Some ten thousand years ago human life changed dramatically. As our
forebears settled down to farm, individual autonomy and the economic balance
of power between the sexes gradually eroded. Codified political and social
hierarchies arose. And as men from England to China cleared and tilled the
fields, bartered goods, and brought their produce to local markets, men soon
owned the land, the livestock, and most of the family’s other wealth. No longer
able to roam and collect the evening fare, locked into second-class jobs of
gardening and keeping the home, lacking property and access to education,
women lost their ancient status in cultures around the world.
8 Moreover,
marriage became a business venture, an exchange of property, political alliances,
and social ties.
9 Neither boy nor girl could wed for love.
Romance could not be stifled. The rich took concubines or second wives; the
landless poor still wed for love.
10 And undoubtedly many men and women in
arranged betrothals later fell in love with one another. People also celebrated
love in myths and legends, dramas, songs, poems, and paintings. But the ancient
Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, early Christians, Muslims, Indians, Chinese,
Japanese, and many others of the historical world usually married for duty,
money, and alliances, not for love. Indeed, romantic love was feared in much of
Asia and parts of Africa. This mercurial force could lead to suicide or homicide;
even worse, it could upset the delicate web of social ties.
With the growth of trade and cities, and then the Industrial Revolution, more
and more European and American men and women fled farm life. Unmoored
from primordial local networks of blood relatives, more and more people were
on their own.
11 And by the nineteenth century, many men and women began to
wed for love—provided their parents agreed to the match.
12 “Cupid’s fiery
shaft,” as Shakespeare called romantic love, had pierced the Western heart.
The steady entrance of women into the paid workforce throughout the
twentieth and into the twenty-first centuries has spread the desire to wed for love
far and wide. Expanding clerical jobs, the burgeoning of the legal profession, the
rise of the health care industries, the flourishing global service economy, the
emergence of nonprofit organizations, and the booming communications age
have all drawn women into the marketplace.
13 As a result, women are gradually
regaining economic power, as well as health and education, almost everywhere.
14
As they become more economically autonomous, these women want to live with
partners whom they love.
“I do.” In a 1991 American survey, 86 percent of men and 91 percent of
women reported that they would not say these words to someone they were not
in love with, even if that person had every other quality they were looking for in
a mate.
15 The Chinese of Hong Kong are equally determined to wed for love. In
a survey done in the 1990s, only 5.8 percent of these men and women said they
would marry someone they were not in love with.
16 Even more remarkable, some
50 percent of American men and women now believe they have the right to
divorce if romantic passion fades.
17
Women are also refusing polygynous unions. Some 84 percent of societies
worldwide permit a man to have more than one wife at a time. Traditionally only
5 to 20 percent of men actually acquired enough wealth and status to attract
multiple wives. Yet women endured these unions: often it was better to be the
second wife of a rich man than the first wife of a poor one. But as more women
have regained economic power in recent decades, fewer are willing to weather
the favoritism, jealousy, and bickering that sharing a husband brings. As
eighteen-year-old Farima Sanati of Teheran, Iran, said, “A woman cannot bear
these things.”
18
Not only is humankind regaining personal autonomy and social, political,
and sexual equality; we also have more time.
Time to Love
Men and women are living longer. Anthropologists believe the natural human
lifespan has not changed in at least a million years. But today far more people
survive infancy, infectious childhood diseases, accidents, childbirth, and malemale violence; many more live into old age. In 1900, only 4 percent of
Americans were over age sixty-five; today II percent survive to this age; by 2030
some 20 percent of all Americans will be over sixty-five; by 2050, 15 to 19
percent of the world population will be over age sixty-five as well.
19
Many older people now live alone, too, rather than with their children. And
they are healthy. In fact, some demographers say we should begin to think of
middle age as extending to age eighty-five, largely because 40 percent of men
and women at that age are fully functional.
20 Humanity is gaining time to love.
Technology is helping. Testosterone creams and patches now keep the sex
drive active. Viagra and other medications enable seniors, largely men, to
perform in bed. Estrogen replacement therapy keeps women’s arousal
mechanisms in gear. And with a host of other innovations, from plastic surgery
and unguents to clothing of every imaginable texture, shape, and style, men and
women can express their sexuality and fall in love almost until they die.
We start early, too. In hunting/gathering societies children often begin to play
at sex and love as early as age five or six. But because girls are thin and get a
great deal of exercise, a girl generally reaches puberty around age sixteen or
seventeen and bears her first child around age twenty. Kids in our modern world
also play “house” and “doctor” at a young age. But with our sedentary lifestyle
and diet rich in fat, girls in advanced industrial societies now reach puberty
around age twelve and a half. More and more get pregnant soon after that,
beginning the adult cycle of romance long before expected.
Ageless Love
But nature likes opportunity. Indeed, we are built to love at any age.
Children fall in love. In one remarkable study of childhood romance, just as
many youngsters aged five reported having been in love as did those aged
eighteen.
21
I noticed this myself. I recently listened to an eight-year-old boy
perfectly describe the symptoms of romantic love as he told me about an eightyear-old girl that he adored. He could not stop thinking about her. He recited
details of her mannerisms and their times together. And he felt elated when she
spoke to him at school.
Men and women in their seventies, eighties, even nineties, also feel love’s
magic.
22 One friend of mine fell in love at age ninety-two. He wife had died five
years before and he became enchanted with an old friend of the family. His only
concern was that she was a younger woman, aged seventy-six. Interestingly, in a
study of 255 adolescents, young adults, middle-aged men and women, and senior
citizens, scientists found no overall difference in the intensity of their romantic
passion; men and women loved just as strongly when they were sixty as when
they were sixteen.
23 Older people do more varied and imaginative things
together.
24 But age makes no difference in feelings of romance.
Why We Love
The ancient Greeks called romantic love the “madness of the Gods.” Why can
this passion be triggered at any age?
Because the drive to love is a multipurpose mechanism.
When children fall in love, they are practicing courtship tactics, exploring
how and when and where to flirt. Boys and girls learn what attracts a partner and
what does not, how to say yes and no, and the feeling of being rejected. They are
preparing for life’s most important act: pursuing a worthy mating partner.
Teenagers have a more difficult task. Courting time is upon them. They are
taking on the primordial shapes for wooing. As they clumsily sift through their
dating opportunities, they acquire knowledge about themselves and others and
develop dislikes and preferences.
25
Most men and women around the world marry in their twenties.
26 Romantic
love now serves its timeless purpose of weeding out unsuitable mates, focussing
one’s attention on a “special” other, forming a socially visible pair-bond with
this beloved, and remaining sexually faithful to “him” or “her” at least long
enough to conceive a child together. In some couples, this passion then destroys
this relationship as a spouse falls in love with someone else and forms a new
pair-bond (unconsciously) to produce more varied young. In other couples,
romantic love serves to glue spouses to each other and thereby support their
mutual offspring for many years.
These long-term unions are known as “companionate marriages” or “peer
marriages,” marriages between equals in which both partners work and share
intimacy and household duties.
27 Because women are re-emerging in the paid
labor force, sociologists predict that peer marriages will become the most
common marriage form of the twenty-first century.
28 And because the population
is aging, divorce rates may remain reasonably steady for years to come.
29
Finding the right mixture of autonomy and closeness probably will be a central
issue for many in these companionate unions.
Why do seniors fall in love? Romance among older people probably also had
adaptive functions in ancestral times. This passion gave aging men and women
energy, sexual afternoons that kept the body supple, a reason to remain vital
members of the community, and a partner who provided physical and emotional
support. Romance among the elderly still serves these timeless purposes.
Until recently older men everywhere in the world sought younger women,
however. So most people expect aging women to have less luck in love. But this
male taste has been changing—in part due to the expense of rearing babies.
Today a working-class American family spends at least $213,000 on their child
before it reaches age eighteen; a middle-class family spends more—before they
pay for college.
30 So older men are becoming wary of women who wish to bear
them young.
31
Gays and lesbians in all cultures also feel romantic passion. As you may
recall from chapter one, my questionnaire on romantic love showed that
homosexuals experience more of the “sweaty palm syndrome” than did other
respondents. I feel sure these men and women carry in their brains exactly the
same human wiring and chemistry for romantic love as everybody else. During
development in the womb or during childhood, however, they acquired a
different focus for their passion.
The Drive to Love
Hail the rise of romantic love—with all of its dreams and sorrows. This passion
has become untethered in our modern world. And millions today are in search of
it. America has some 46 million single women and 38 million single men over
the age of eighteen.
32 Twenty-five percent of them have joined a dating service
in a quest for true love; many more scour the personal ads in newspapers and
magazines.
33
In 2002, matchmaking online and off in America became a $917
million business.
34
But of all the ways to find romance, one of the most remarkable to me is
polyamory, the taking of “many loves.” Polyamorous men and women form
partnerships with more than one individual at a time. They believe one person
cannot suit all one’s needs; yet none wish to uproot a long-term, steady,
satisfying marriage. So spouses agree to be honest with each other, set some
rules for discretion, and start a romance on the side. This way, they reason, each
can enjoy feelings of attachment to one partner and romance with someone
else.
35 Appropriately, their most prominent magazine is entitled Loving More.
Polyamory is utopian—and impractical. As you know, romantic love is
interwoven in a host of other motivation/emotion circuits in the brain—including
the other primary mating drives, lust and male-female attachment. I mentioned
earlier that although these three brain systems regularly interact, they can operate
independently. Indeed, you can feel deep attachment for a long-term partner,
while you feel romantic love for someone else, while you feel the sex drive when
you read a book, see a film, or conjure up a sexual image in your mind. This
wiring probably evolved, in part, to enable ancestral men and women to maintain
a long-term pair-bond while they took advantage of extra (often clandestine)
mating opportunities. Polyamorous men and women aim to do this openly.
But humankind does not share love gracefully. As an Australian Aborigine
put it, “We are a jealous people.” Not surprisingly, polyamorous couples spend
many hours every week sorting out their feelings of possessiveness and jealousy.
The independence of these three mating drives causes all of us turmoil at
some point in our lives. High rates of adultery and divorce, the prevalence of
stalking and spousal battering, and the worldwide omnipresence of love-related
homicide, suicide, and clinical depression are all the fallout of our drive to love
and love again.
Yet for all the tears and tantrums of romantic disappointment, most of us
recover and return to courting. Romantic love has given humankind tremendous
joy. It has also contributed much to society in general. The concepts of the
husband, the wife, the father, and the nuclear family; our customs for wooing
and marriage; the plots of our great operas, novels, plays, films, songs, and
poems; our paintings and our sculptures; many of our traditions; even some of
our holidays: billions of cultural artifacts stem, in part, from this ancient drive to
love.
Yet we still know so little about this madness of the gods. For example, some
brain process, still unidentified, must produce the sense of fusion with the
beloved that the lover feels. Scientists are beginning to pinpoint the brain regions
that become active when one feels fusion with a “higher power,” such as God.
36
Perhaps this brain region is also involved in love. We don’t know what creates
the lover’s craving for sexual exclusivity either. This, too, must be accompanied
by some brain anatomy and functions.
Research on the brain circuitry of romantic love also raises wider questions.
Should doctors medicate stalkers and spouse abusers with drugs that change
brain function? Should lawyers, judges, and legislators regard those who commit
crimes of passion as chemically disabled? Should divorce laws accommodate
our human tendency to leave unhappy unions? The more we learn about the
biology of romance (and lust

To all of my friends around the world. This book is for you. Thank you for
encouraging me to be myself. This book is my tribute to all of you.

J. K.
introduction
This book you are holding is a book full of love. It was written with love, with
the hope that it will reach you wherever you are, touch you and inspire you.
In many ways I’ve been writing this book for years. I’ve been on the journey
of choosing to love myself for many years now. The past five years I’ve
dedicated myself wholly to the subject. I’ve read books, I’ve gone to seminars,
and I practiced various exercises regularly.
You may ask why this obsession with this subject of loving yourself?
Quite frankly, I don’t know. All I know is that I have felt a hunger to fill a gap
in my soul. I’ve tried to fill it with work and accomplishments. And it didn’t
work. I tried to fill it with love, romance and sex, and became even more
depressed. I tried creation – doing art and writing – and it got me closer, but
didn’t fill the gap wholly.
I am a pleaser. I always liked to please others. I also liked to be well regarded.
Early on I learnt that when I brought good grades home, I received positive
attention and love. I therefore tried to bring the best grades I could. After school
I did it with my work as an artist: bigger paintings, better paintings, more
extravagant exhibitions – all to get positive attention. I did all this to make me
feel that I’m alright.
But soon enough this way of life took its toll. I was living for other people. I
was trying to make my parents proud, my girlfriend proud, my siblings, friends,
even distant acquaintances. And it was tiring, exhausting, and unhealthy.
I began having severe back pains, often paralyzing me for days. I did
physiotherapy, acupuncture, whatever – it didn’t help. And things were getting
worse.
In my love life, I found myself in the second, if not third, unhealthy
relationship. I was trying to be the good guy all the time, while not really
knowing who I was and what I wanted. Even asking this question seemed to me
like an odd, if not a rude, question to ask.
This book details my journey. It is a journey towards loving myself.
Have I arrived? Well, I think I’m still working on it. Each month, each year, I
feel that I do love myself more. I feel that I respect myself more. Each year I’m
becoming kinder to myself.
This journey has not been easy. To an extent, it still continues. I still have lots
of work to do.
But the benefits I’m already reaping are amazing. So amazing, in fact, that I
decided to sit down and write this book, to tell you all that’s possible if you
dedicate yourself to this journey.
I found that loving yourself is a form of art. And while I do not strive for
perfection, I do appreciate those artists and artisans that have made their art a
sublime one.
In this book I share the processes, the exercises, the mental highs and lows,
and through personal example, I hope to inspire you to practice the art of loving
yourself.
“I am an artist at living - my work of art
is my life.”

down only what he knows. I have
guesses enough of my own.”

EXPERIENCE, NOTHING BUT EXPERIENCE
All I am about to share with you is my knowledge the way I experienced it, the
way I came to understand it through being involved.
Much of it I learnt the tough way.
Don’t get me wrong. I’m still working on this very thing myself. I am working
on loving myself. On accepting myself for who I am.
It’s a journey.
Each year I feel that I love myself more. I feel that I allow myself to giggle
and laugh out loud, without caring all too much what others around me think. I
allow myself to cry, or at least be vulnerable, around people I care about. I allow
myself to seem stupid at times, asking questions for answers I think I should
have known.
There is great freedom in being yourself. We all love and are attracted to
people that are just “themselves.” Oprah Winfrey is an example. She is pretty
good at being herself, and that’s what makes me like her so much. So are other
teachers and celebrities, when I sense that they are authentic and real, I love
them all the more.
But the road to authenticity passes through self-love-town. You gotta be
willing to accept yourself for who you are. Actually, more than accept - embrace.
I went to this Jack Canfield workshop in 2011, and he gave us this exercise of
standing in front of the mirror every evening, and telling ourselves encouraging
words. These would be words about how well you did that day, and stuff like
that. No reprimand allowed. Oh, and yes, that end piece. He told us to, at the
end, look ourselves in the eye and say, “I love you.”
Arrrrrghhhhh!!!
I hated that.
I barely looked at myself in the eyes when I said that.
And when I did, I actually faked it.
It was as if I looked at someone I’d rather not be around, and say, “So nice to
see you!”
Uh huh. Right.
Long way to go!
But I kept doing this darn exercise. Each night. Almost every night. For
months and months.
At the time, I was in an amazing relationship with a girl I thought I was to
marry. I didn’t want to embarrass myself by telling her that I do this weird mirror
thing.
So I didn’t.
I also didn’t tell her other things that were showing up. I felt… I felt that she
was judging me.
She wasn’t the only one. I was judging myself constantly as well.
She used to – let’s call her Autumn, that’s a nice name – well, Autumn used to
often be upset with me. It might have been something I said or did, she would
retreat to her taking “space” and needing to be alone.
And so I was left being in a relationship, alone.
I also spoke to her about marriage and about our future together. She was not
into it. And she said that, and I’m paraphrasing, “given some things I’ve seen
about you, about your inner insecurities, I just don’t… see… myself being
married to such a person, you see?”
I nodded.
But I didn’t see.
All I saw was how through me showing her my real self, my vulnerable self, I
was actually pushing her away.
Was there something really that bad about me? To the core? That bad that
Autumn could see and be… appalled by?
I wanted to quit this stupid exercise, that mirror thing. I kept repeating some
affirmative words to myself, and at the end telling myself that ‘I love myself’.
But I wasn’t really there.
Deep inside I probably thought, “I love myself, BUT…”
And then the list would come.
“But you are too sensitive sometimes. But you are too stressed some times.
But you are too girly some times. And sometimes, you’re just plain annoying.”
I can’t even write these words right now. So much self-loathing, so much
unaccepting of myself. I was far from embracing myself.
I went on with the mirror exercise. And following the encouragement of
Autumn, I began going to a shrink. This psychologist was a friend of her
psychologist. And so, for the first time in my life I began going to an actual,
official therapy. I put my pride aside, and did everything I thought I needed to do
in order to be able to save this relationship.
What was unique, though, was that Eyal, the therapist, actually was often
upset with my stories about Autumn.
He’d say, “But did you tell her that it upset you that she did that?”
“I… tried…?” I said.
“Well, you should be able to communicate with her freely!”
So I tried. Every few weeks or so I mustered the courage and I would tell her
about her not accepting me. About her being easily hurt and forgetting who I am
and that I love her. About her distancing herself from me. About me not knowing
how to communicate with her.
We both had much work to do, I realize now.
Each time I finally spoke, Autumn would be all loving and embracing. I think
it touched her, that I opened up, that I cared. That I cried.
But unfortunately, this feeling of openness within her lasted only a day or so.
Then I’d get an SMS from her saying, “It was a bit much for me. I need to take
some space.”
I came to despise this word. “Space.” What the heck.
In the beginning I used to give her all the “SPACE” I could. But after few
days I felt that I was pretty lonely. What was this relationship for, if we can’t
connect and support, and be together?
Eyal would listen to my explanation of how Autumn needs some space now. I
would see his eyebrows frowning, and his head shaking ‘no’.
“But,” he’d say, “every time you’re trying to talk and solve things, she walks
away.”
“Yeah,” I’d say.
The mirror exercise kept repeating. I began feeling a difficulty doing it. I
hated it. I also hated the fact I was in a relationship that didn’t work for me.
“I deserve better!” I said.
Eyal looked at me. Do I see a tinge of hope in his eyes?
“You do,” he said.
“I can’t stand how each time it’s just ‘sorry, this was too much for me,’ and
that then she’s gone.”
Eyal said, “Well, we are not judging Autumn. She has her own things to go
through, and her places to grow. But we care about Jonathan, and it seems like
you are torturing yourself.”
“Yeah…?”
“Yes.”
And so, few months later, with the help of Autumn’s psychologist’s
psychologist friend, I dared to end it.
Autumn was outraged.
I was too.
Lots of tears.
I remember being by the sea, walking barefoot, feeling helpless. This
relationship was supposed to be it. Like, IT it. And now I’m… alone? Again?
And Autumn was everything I could hope for. She was a freaking dancer, of
national level, and a voracious reader, and a super intelligent girl, funny,
charming.
But it just didn’t sit right with me being on a journey of choosing ME. Of
choosing myself, of choosing to treat myself well.
Autumn was echoing my past – me shunning parts of myself and not taking
me for what I am, my WHOLE self.
Autumn was sweet. She meant well.
And Autumn eventually forced me to prove myself that I actually DO love
myself.
There were rough months ahead. I kept doing the mirror exercise. At one
point I might have added an actual hug, an embrace, of me rapping my arms
around myself, tilting my head gently on my shoulder, and rocking myself from
side to side. Few seconds of bliss, of care, of affection to myself.
Oh, how much I needed that.
With time there was more love to myself. I felt more… is dignified the word?
I felt respect to myself. I felt like I had something to offer the world. Something
to offer to a girl, a woman, that would be willing to die for me. Not ‘die’ die, but
close enough.
With time I felt more respect and affection to myself.
About a year later I entered into a relationship with this girl, who was
somewhat into it, somewhat not. For several dates and so she kept going back
and forth. I was willing to be patient, I liked her a lot.
But I also liked myself a lot.
There was one time when this new girl did something annoying, don’t
remember exactly what it was. She was probably short tempered about
something rather. And in the way she spoke to me I felt like I was in that old
movie again.
Darn it.
I hurried to say, before I regret, before I overthink it. “Hey, that… that
wasn’t… that didn’t feel very nice. I’d rather you not speak that way to me. If
you are upset, then say that, but don’t… You know?”
And I saw something responding in her eyes, her demeanor changed. “Why,
sure. You’re right,” she said.
I felt like such a MAN at that moment. No. I was not going to take any form
of abuse-even the slightest. And I really really liked the way she responded.
I also felt that she liked the fact I said something. She later on embraced me
closer. And a year or so later told me it was a defining moment for her. “It
meant,” she explained, “that you SEE me. That you really cared about my
wellbeing.”
I was a little dumbfounded of how it showed that, but I didn’t complain.
Two more years later we got married. And that whole happily ever after thing.
Had I not had the courage to speak up for myself, we most likely wouldn’t
have been together today. Had I not done the mirror exercise religiously,
including actually physically embracing myself, I wouldn’t have had the courage
to speak up. Had I not been determined to LOVE myself, I wouldn’t have had
the tenacity and the audacity to actually do this ridiculous mirror thing.
So my point is, CHOOSE YOU. Choose yourself. Love yourself. Work on
giving more respect and more appreciation to yourself. Please!

MY REQUEST
My request from you is that you do love yourself. You have invested the time,
money and energy to read this book. Therefore, I request, no, I demand from
you, to love yourself.
Now, while it’s a journey with many perks and future benefits, it ain’t easy.
Yes, I don’t want you to be misguided. Easy it ISN’T.
But it’s an important journey nevertheless.
I ask you to take the time and ask yourself, daily: “If I truly loved myself,
what would I do today? How will my day be different?”
You got to ask this question daily.
You also got to ask yourself, “Which kind of example do I give to others as to
how to treat me?”
This means, if you are tired and exhausted, you tell others, “please tire me and
exhaust me!”
If you are burdened and upset, you tell others, “please burden me and upset
me!”
If you feel rejuvenated and loved, you tell others, “please rejuvenate me and
love me.”
If you do one more favor for someone without really wanting to do it, you say,
“please give me one more favor for me to do for you.” And you and I know that
it’s always just one more thing, just one more favor. Your life is filled with ‘just
one more’, that have accumulated to mountains of ‘just one more’s’.
Now, it won’t necessarily be easy. People like you the way you are. People
don’t like changes, and neither do you nor I. We hate changes. We are habitual
people. Tell us where our cheese is, and leave us alone. Oh, it’s a new cheese?
Better? Neh, give me the old one, I’m already used to it.
So you will find that other people are used to a very specific version of you.
The upgraded version of you? Well, no thanks.
People, especially those around you, will find that you are changing, and not
for the better.
You are a pleaser. Yeah. I unmasked you! Why do you think you are reading
this freakin’ book?
Yep. That’s what you are. You wanna be liked, and that is often more
important than your sleep, than your time to yourself, than your healthy diet,
than your hobbies and your interests. You want to make others happy.
Now, why am I on your case?
Well, if you want me to get off your case, than quit reading.
The fact you keep reading is that you want me to preach you the gospel of
relearning how to BE. You have conditioned yourself to act in a way that is
harmful for you. It really is. I’m sorry, but it is.
There is a place inside you, a real place, of self-protection. This place, this
guardian angel of sorts, has guided you here. To hear these words.
This place is telling you: if you won’t slow down and begin treating yourself
nicer – if you won’t begin to put yourself first – if you won’t start slowing down
and showing love to yourself – then… well, things are gonna get bad.
Yep. I’m sorry again to be the messenger of bad news. But basically, what I’m
gathering is that you are telling me to tell you that if you won’t change, and
ASAP, that means YESTERDAY, then things are going to begin surfacing.
Oh, I hate to tell you that. Like you, I’m a pleaser too. So, for me to tell you
the bad news is NOT an easy thing.
But what I’m instructed to tell you is that all kinds of health issues,
relationship messes, financial crap, family shindigs, and other wonderful and
delightful things are on your horizon.
But I’m here also to tell you that you can change direction. Yeah, you can
CHANGE DIRECTION. You don’t have to head towards the cliff. You don’t
have to.
You can change direction. You can sooth your body, steep your soul with love,
nourish your heart and stroke your mind.
All these things will shift you from the direction you are headed to, that cliff,
to a whole other direction. The metaphor that comes to mind is of an oasis.
Rather than heading to a cliff, head towards an oasis of love, of self care, of self
preservation.
You can do it. I don’t care how stubborn you are. How much you think that
you are a lost case.
“Jonathan!” you may want to yell, “But you don’t know me. This is WHO I
AM! I’ve always been that way, since I remember myself!”
Oh yeah?
Then why do you waste my time and your time? There are plenty of other
books with nice itty-bitty advises and things you can enjoy the thought of and
never do.
You are here to be told the TRUTH.
The truth is that you can NEVER give someone what you don’t have. By you
helping others and pleasing others and playing to other people’s needs and
expectations you are robbing yourself from the life that you deserve.
Let me repeat that. By pleasing others constantly, you are robbing yourself of
the life that you deserve.
And yes, I’m talking about “others”, whether it’s that precious hubby of
yours, that wifie you adore, that child who still needs you, that friend who is in a
real bad circumstances for the third time this year.
Oh, and I almost forgot: that parent that is really on your case and for no good
reason.
You cannot give to them on your expense. Really. You are not helping them.
Again: you are NOT helping them. You are making them collaborators in this
robbery – in which you are both the robber and the victim.
Think of it, will ya?

LOVING YOURSELF
Will you allow me, for a moment, to speak to your SELF? To your inner voice? To the child inside you?
Hey there. I appreciate you being here. I appreciate the time you are taking to read this. I appreciate you.
Yes, I appreciate you.
In other words, I love you.
Yes, I know it may feel weird, to hear it, in such simple words.
But I really do.
I love you, you beautiful creation. I love all that you are.
Even the parts about you that you don’t like. That you are afraid to show. I like those parts of you too.
I love each part of you.
I feel so sorry for all that you’ve been through. But now it’s time for you to relax into my embrace.
Hear my words, feel my warmth.
You are a child. All you seek for, in your multitude of ways, in your struggles to please – is love. You are
seeking to be embraced, to be cared for. You want to be told how great you are.
And here I am, telling these words to you.
Will you listen?
Will you listen to me when I say that I’m sorry for hurting you?
I’m sorry for neglecting you.
I’m sorry for having abandoned you at times.
But now I’m here.
Yes, I know it will take time for you to fully trust me; for me to gain your full trust. But I’m not going
anywhere.
There is freedom in my presence. There is everything you ever wanted – the joy, the care, the
nourishment. It’s here.
Will you listen when I tell you that I love you? That I really care for you?
I’m sorry at times I allowed myself to compare you, to judge you, to criticize you. I did that out of my
own insecurities.
Not because I didn’t love you.
I do love you.
I am here for you.
I am here to tell you that you are an angel. That your smile, your eyes, your voice – you are a true angel.
You are so sweet that I don’t think I’ll be able to find the words to describe to you just how sweet you are.
And my love to you is so great, I’m unsure whether I’ll be able to find the words to describe to you just
how much I love you.
I love you. I really do.
It’s simple. I don’t ask you to do anything, or to prove yourself to me. From the moment you were
conceived I loved you.
I will always love you.
I will love you when you don’t feel worthy of my love. I nevertheless will love you.
I will love you when you judge yourself for not being successful enough yet. I will love you when you
choose to compare yourself to others relentlessly. I will love you when you look in the mirror and are not
overjoyed with the magnificence that you are.
I will sing for you, comfort you, hug and embrace you, direct you, guide you, nourish and feed you, I
will clean you, wash you, heal your wounds, clothe you, take care of you in every way you desire.
The reason is that I love you.
You were always deserving of this love. Yet you did not receive it. You therefore taught yourself that,
actually, really, you do not deserve unconditional love. That as long as you work for it, and prove yourself,
then and only then you are deserving of some love. Not much.
You have taught yourself a false teaching, my dear. It is false, I’m sorry.
As a baby, as a tiny baby, you were loveable. You were love. You were the epitome and the definition of
what love is. You were so sweet, so good, so miraculous. You were.
Life has taught you wrongly. But I’m here now to correct this wrongdoing. The mere fact that you are
reading these words shows that you resonate with them. While you may judge these words as incorrect,
somewhere inside you, you yearn for these words. The only reason for your yearning is that these words are
true.
These are true words. It may take you time to fully comprehend them. You may resist, you may cry and
protest. But the power of love will wash all over you, and calm your resistance.
This resistance that you developed was useful for you at one point. You developed it to survive. It helped
you to cope, to stiff the upper lip and carry on. Had you demanded all that you deserved, you would have
lived in a harsh reality of your needs being ignored and not fulfilled. Even laughed at.
So what you learnt to do is to minimize your needs. You looked at expression of love given to others,
and you said, “I don’t need that!” when in fact your heart yelped for that thing, for that thing exactly.
It’s ok, we’re just revealing the truth.
It may hurt, but it will feel much better.
The truth is that you deserved all the love that you didn’t receive. There is nothing rude or
unappreciative in saying that. You do recognize, at least when you are centered, that they have done
everything they could. But now you realize that it wasn’t enough. This realization does not blame or resent.
It simply is.
What do you need this ‘realization’ for? Why do you need this painful acknowledgement from yourself
to yourself that actually, no, you didn’t receive all that you needed, all the love and all the caring.
This realization is important. This acknowledgement is crucial. Because it sets you free. It forces you to
look to the truth in the eye, and accept it.
With this acceptance comes an inner sense of relief. Wow. I actually didn’t get what I wanted. I actually
deserved to get more. The thoughts that I asked for too much are actually judgments given to me by others.
I adopted them, but now I can let them go.
Now I see that all that I craved for, I deserved to get. There was nothing snotty, rude, disrespectful, needy
or spoiled in my needs to be loved unconditionally. There was nothing despiteful, spiteful, impolite or
egoistic in me asking for what I wanted.
In fact, the contrary is true. When I indeed cried and fought for my birthright to be given love, attention,
care, security – I was doing what a baby does when it cries, I notified and informed that I needed to be
tended to, to be taken care of.
We can be so judgmental of that. Even the word “baby” has become affiliated with being ‘needy’,
‘attention-grabbing’ and ‘immature’. Even the word “childish” has become a synonym for ‘egoistic’, ‘rude’
and ‘impolite’.
But these words, “baby” and “childish” are of the most beautiful words ever created in the human
language. Even in tribal times when words were just created, the word “baby” was one of the first to appear,
and be told with love and care.
You asked for what you needed. You should not be ashamed, but proud. You did your share, you fulfilled
the creation’s purpose. A non demanding baby may very well be unable to communicate their most basic
needs, and if that so, may actually not be able to survive.
I am stressing that to you, my baby, my child, so that you will walk proudly on this earth, saying, “I have
asked for what I wanted. I did my share in the creation.”
Then, at one point, you began seeing that when you asked for what you wanted, you did not always
receive it. When you cried for love, you were sometimes assigned to be quiet in your room. When you
struggled for attention you were reprimanded and hissed at.
And you learnt that you are undeserving of love.
Now you are unlearning that false learning. It is time.

BUT NOW YOU CAN GIVE YOURSELF We need to realize that our
resentment is eating us alive.
Now, even if you don’t harbor difficult feelings towards your parents or caregivers, there is always some
more to let go of.
At times it seems to me that, enough, I’ve already let it all go. I cried through it, I processed it, now it
should be gone.
And then some times pass, and here something comes, and I’m like – not this one again!
I used to be upset by that.
But I realized over time that as we grow and develop, we’ll encounter new layers, more profound, that
we need to go through.
It’s like a spiral. We’ve been here, it seems, but it’s only the same area, not the same level.
So I wish to encourage you to let go.
What we are letting go of is resentment. We are letting go of the hope that things could have been
different.
We let go of our disappointments and our pain.
And we choose to fill ourselves with the love we so craved from others.
Somewhere in time we were given the God-gift of creating our lives. We live the first part of our lives
being a character in someone else’s plot. We need them, we require them for our mere survival.
And then there comes a time in which we walk, we talk, we can feed ourselves, we can take care of
ourselves.
And rather than feeling anger at those that didn’t do a good enough job (and you may say, a lousy job in
fact!), it’s time for us to give love to ourselves.
Let’s do it, God dammit.

yourself or not.”

MORE GOOD WORDS
I want to remind your subconscious few more things about yourself. So I’m
going to speak as if I were you. Your brain will perceive these words written
here as if they were your own. Feel free to read it slowly. Also, put some good
music if you’d like. You can read it quietly or out loud. Whatever works for you.
This comes with love from my heart.
Hey there. I’m so happy you are taking the time to read these lines.
Truth is that I missed you.
It’s been a while since I spoke to you. It’s been a while since I spoke kindly to
you.
I really care about you, you know?
Really.
Oh, I know I have a long way to go, ‘till I’m able to express my love to you
better. I’m quite reticent when it comes to words of affection to you, you know?
I’m sorry for that. I promise it’s not going to be that always.
I promise you that there will be a time in which your inner chatter, in which I
am the main voice, will be generally a kind one. I promise there will be a time in
which I only share love with you. And when I do have advice or a critic, my
words will be constructive and gentle.
Yep. I’m really sorry for having been so… harsh on you at times.
Do you hear me? I’m really sorry for being harsh on you so often. You don’t
deserve that.
You deserve the best. You deserve kindness, care, and gentleness. And I’ve
failed you so many times.
Will you be willing to trust me again if I promised that I will be kinder to
you? Oh please do. Please trust me.
You must also understand me. As your inner voice, I work day and night to
help you. I try to save you from difficult situations, make sure you don’t
embarrass yourself, make sure you don’t make yourself seem like an idiot – and
more, making sure that people like you, that you are being needed and wanted by
others, that people are impressed with you as much as I can make them… That
has been my job, you see?
But I realize now this job has made you and I quite conflicted. I’m therefore
willing to take a step back. I want to have a relationship with you, do you hear
me? I want us to be friends.
I want you and I, I and you, the whole YOU, made out of you and me, to be
one. To be one again. Do you remember when we were young? I was rarely
speaking to you. And quite frankly, I liked it better.
When I was just watching you being yourself, playing, making fun – that’s
when I had a much better time myself.
I hate being in war with you. I hate now that each time I tell you something
you cringe. And I also hate that now, when I’m finally trying to tell you words of
kindness – that you now don’t believe me!
I hate that.
The reason I’m so flustered and… sad, really, is that I WANT a relationship
with you. I really do.
Hey, please, I’m willing to change. I want us to be well together. I’m here to
serve you. That was my original intention, when I began speaking up inside you,
it was just to help you avoid the pain you felt. Remember the pain? Remember
how unloved you felt? Well, this is why I began speaking to you, to protect you.
It’s now that I realize that by constantly beating you down I actually
suffocated you, and really… lost you.
I want to find you.
I want you to find me, ME, that voice you have inside, and for you to be
pleased with what I tell you.
Because you do so much good, and you don’t even see it.
Because you are wonderful, and you don’t even know it.
Because you are really beautiful, and you aren’t even willing to entertain this
thought!
I suffer seeing that you are not loving yourself.
And I hate thinking that me, your inner voice, had a huge part in it.
So, I’m changing. I am changing. With your encouragement, I can be the best
inner voice ever. EVER! I can show you love, and kindness, and care, and
tenderness – all those things that you deserve.
I can give you all that. And I want to. This is why I directed you to this book,
to these words. Because I really care for you.
There is magic in this moment, of me speaking love to you. There is
sacredness in me finally speaking softly to you. Do you hear me? Do you
understand that I really do care about you?
I promise you that there will come a time in which these words won’t feel
foreign to you. There will come a time in which you feel my genuine love, your
own genuine love to yourself. I promise you that.
I also promise you that one day, your cynicism and critic of these kinds of
words, of these kinds of ‘psycho babble’ – your attitude will change. You are
now just afraid, really. Behind all your cynicism there lies a fear. That I will tell
you these words, that you will be willing to accept, and that I will then, out of
the blue, batter you.
So, yes, what can I say. Your fear is justified. I have NOT been kind to you.
Constantly critiquing and not loving. Far from loving.
But not only am I willing to change, I’m also changing right now, this very
moment, in front of your eyes. I’m changing.
I tell you that no more will I treat you so badly. I will treat you well from now
on. When you look in the mirror, you’ll be able to see me, deep inside your eyes.
When you close your eyes, you’ll be able to feel me. When you go to sleep, I
will caress you in your heart. I will protect you, nourish you, take good care of
you.
Because you are important to me.
You are. Important. To me.
Again, please do accept my apology. I’m here for you. FOR you. Not against
you. I’m here to love you. And I will love you. I already do love you. I always
loved you. Just didn’t know how to express it, how to show it. Now I’m learning.
Is it ok to learn? Is it ok for me to learn how to show you love in a way that will
be good for you?
Please forgive me. I’m sorry. I forgive myself for my wrongdoings, as I know
that they came out of real care and concern about you. I thank you for giving me
another chance to be a loving voice within you. I love you, I really do.

YOUR GIFTS
I hope that last exercise was powerful for you. Thank you for cooperating with
it, as much as currently feels comfortable for you. I recommend you reading it
over and over, until you can muster the courage to write your own version. Then
read it to yourself out loud. It sounds odd, but it’s really powerful. I actually
recorded it and I play it to myself over and over again. It’s POWERFUL!
Now I want to talk to you about your gifts. You have so many unique gifts to
give to the world. No one can do things the way you do.
If your current self esteem is low, you will resist these words. You will say,
“well, how do you know?” and you will also think that I’m writing this for other
people, not for you.
But I’m writing these words for each and every human being reading. We all,
ALL of us, have unique gifts. No two trees are similar. In fact, no two leaves are
similar.
And no two people are similar.
You were born with a unique DNA that separates you from any other person.
You were given talents, abilities and skills different than any other person.
When you resist loving yourself, when you refuse to have a healthy respect to
yourself, when you decline to take good care of yourself – you rob the world of
your gifts.
I’m going to use some harsh words, to make sure you get the message.
You, my love, are a thief. By trying to have everyone satisfied and gratified,
by making sure everyone is appeased and pleased, you are robbing us all from
your real self.
All the great creators in life, all the wonderful composers, actors, writers,
statesmen, activists, artists – they all had one thing in common. It’s one thing
that you resist having. It’s one thing that you would rather do without.
That thing is that they often put their wellbeing first. Yep. They did. Danielle
Steel had to spend hours awake at night to write. It was important to her. It might
have had an effect on her love life, or on her children. Yes, she tried to please
everyone, but she also HAD to write. And write she did.
Oprah Winfrey again and again said things that many people didn’t want to
hear. She fought to bring many gay people to her show, even though some
viewers said, “enough with those gays!” But she stuck to it, to her truth. Part of
why she is so loved is that she kept sticking to her truth, even if it wasn’t
popular.
While not necessarily well known today by many, Willy Brandt is considered
one of Germany’s best chancellors ever. Brandt took a pro soviet stance, at the
pick of the cold war. He said that only through embracing the soviets can we
avoid world war III. His dovish attitude, which included falling on his knees in
front of a holocaust memorial in Poland, brought him many critics, who in fact
almost succeeded to overthrow his government. But Brandt had felt the truth
inside him, and was willing to compromise his popularity.
So did Lincoln, with the fight to end slavery. He received so many opponents
for him voicing his opinions, and later on fighting for them. Martin Luther King
Jr. too had to face much criticism. Many Christian leaders objected to his
disobedience of the law, in what they saw as an un-Christian way. But King kept
fighting for a cause he found just, even if others didn’t approve of him.
I can go on and on in this list. It will show us that anyone who had ever
accomplished anything worth while, did it while facing opposition.
Now, I hate opposition. And I would really like to have everyone like me. But
I am coming to understand that that cannot be.
I recently posted some pro-peace stuff on my Facebook page. While I did get
few “likes” I actually got more negative comments. Most of my friends, who are
Jewish and are traumatized by the Israeli-Arab conflict, think that by being proArab, I must be also anti-Israel. And that’s far from being the truth. I’m proeveryone having the right to live in the beautiful Holy Land.
I tried to explain it, but I saw that some people wouldn’t have my explanation.
The most difficult thing was to have family members critic my opinion, call
me insane and naïve, and basically walk away from me.
Oh, it hurt.
It still hurts.
In an effort to calm myself I figured I should just freeze this post. Temporarily
take it off. When I’m stronger, I thought, I will bring it back.
I looked at the options. No, not “Delete post”. No, not “Hide from timeline”. I
want it frozen, gone for now.
I knew that if I hide it from the timeline, nevertheless people can still see it
and comment. That basically all those who commented on it will be able to read
the following comments, and continue to criticize me.
I was desperate. I wanted out. I told my wife I feel ambushed. By the same
people who love me and give me many ‘likes’ whenever I post photos of our
baby girl or of my art.
Having no other option, I chose “Hide from timeline.”
To myself I thought, well, that doesn’t show much confidence, hiding your
opinions.
Yeah, well, ok, but neither is getting all this crap from others making me able
to breathe well.
But on the following day, and the day after, the Facebook comments kept
coming. My aunt said, “Unfortunately Yoni you are living in supposed to be
perfect world, however the reality is totally different and very grim, I think its
time for you to face that reality and realize that very fast!”
My cousin said, “I’m appalled, just appalled by your insensitivity.”
And I wanted to cry.
I told Hallel I cannot do it any more.
She advised me to delete the post and end with it.
As the mouse cursor hovered over the “Delete post” option, I sighed.
I believed in the words I wrote. I believed what I said was the right thing, that
it’s only through embracing and recognizing the other that we’ll be able to live
here in peace.
I thought that the fear and trauma that is leading all my friends and family to
almost outcast me, is not the constructive way towards reconciliation. And I
thought that ultimately, in their hearts, they want peace and reconciliation. They
just don’t know how to bring it to reality.
I felt that I knew. Having nearly 20 years of experience, hands on, in the
peace scene, I’ve seen Arabs and Jews transform, open up, and denounce
violence. And the only thing that enabled them to do that was kindness,
acceptance, embrace, listening to each other’s stories and pain.
The mouse hovered over the “Delete post.”
I can delete this post. Sure. One click and it will be behind me.
I can delete this post and shun my own opinions, even if I believe I’m right.
I can delete this post and let go of this temporary pain, this embarrassment,
this feeling of becoming disliked by many people who until few days ago I was
quite ‘Liked’ by.
I could.
But I then decided not to.
Life is too short to delete my opinions, erase my preferences, and adjust my
views according to others.
I didn’t erase that post.
Rather, I let the thing slowly mellow down. After few days of the post being
hidden from my Facebook timeline, those responding and corresponding began
to seize.
And I felt more secure.
It’s not that today I feel more confident to write everything I think on my
Facebook page. But, and this is a big BUT, I decide to stick to myself. I decide to
love myself.
Loving yourself and putting yourself first is not popular. You will not get
much signs of appreciation by those around you. Many will be surprised by you
not being “nice” all of a sudden.
But the journey to loving yourself must go through putting yourself first.
There is no other way.
Now, I’m not telling you to become aloof, to put yourself above others, to
become anti-social. But I am telling you that you will NEVER be able to please
EVERYONE.
And with that being said, why won’t you choose to please yourself first?
Why won’t you choose to please yourself FIRST?
Please entertain this question…? Why won’t you put yourself first?
It’s about time.

LETTING GO
The first thing we must do to be ok with ourselves is love ourselves. Now, we’ve
been exploring it now for quite a few pages. It sounds simple. But for most of us
it’s not.
I’m here to share with you my struggles in this journey, hoping the lessons I
learnt through pain and struggle will help you.
The crucial thing to understand is that you are fighting a battle, which is the
most important battle in your life.
There’s a reason why I dedicate so much of this book to the need we all have
to please others. This need, I believe, is the number one obstacle.
Because loving ourselves takes time. It takes practice. It’s a habitual thing –
something we’ll add to our everyday routines. Some piece of time we’ll schedule
into every week. Treats and indulges we’ll put into our life, as if our life depends
on them.
And our life does depend on them.
You are being asked to put yourself first. You really are asked to do that.
The funny thing is that you have heard the opposite statement hundreds of
times in your life.
Instead of hearing, “put yourself first” you heard, “be kind to him!”
“Be a lady!” (which means: don’t show your real self)
“Be a man!” (which means: don’t show your emotions)
“Be a grown up will ya?”
“Don’t be a baby!”
“Now, I want many things too but I don’t get them!”
“Don’t be selfish!”
“Don’t be so needy!”
“Oh stop whining!”
“We’ll get that for you later.”
“You are way too noisy!”
Arrrrrghhhhh!
I bet you can add your own phrases to this list.
Now, I’m not blaming our parents and the grown ups around us. They did the
best they can. But it’s no shame to say that their best wasn’t enough.
Let’s have a look for a second at those figures who spoke that way and
modeled this unhealthy and wrong outlook –
you need to put other people’s needs first.
For example, I had a grandmother who used to not complain at all. She died
from cancer in her sixties.
I was five and barely knew her.
My father says, “Oh, I wish she would have complained more, not held
everything inside…”
Not that my father is such a great example of the opposite. Remember, we
model what we see.
My father also sticks to phrases that can be detrimental.
For example, he says, “family must come first.”
Now, I agree. But not to the extent that family comes BEFORE yourself.
We kids constantly tell him to learn how to say “no”, to us, to our mother, to
relatives. Since he doesn’t know how to do that, he runs around doing errands
and he is constantly exhausted. Recently he complained to me that he wants to
go on a vacation already. When he and my mother go to a vacation far away, no
one can expect him to do anything, and he then feels free, stronger, better,
healthier.
I told him what I’m telling you. You need to change some of your beliefs, and
learn to put yourself first. What’s good in going to a vacation if three days after
you come back you’re already swamped with to-dos for everyone but yourself?
I’m all for vacations, believe me, I LOVE vacations. But my dad, me, and
you, need to all learn how to embed the qualities of a proper vacation in our day
to day life.
My father especially likes going abroad. There’s a reason for that. There, his
cellphone doesn’t work. It works on Wi-Fi, and he can receive Facebook and
Whatsapp messages. Sometimes he also buys a local SIM card wherever they
are. But the main thing is that his phone doesn’t ring.
When in the country, my dad’s cellphone rings constantly. Old aunts and an
assortment of I-need-help-now friends call him. Since he had not mustered the
art of saying ‘no’ he has come to long for vacations. Far away vacations, abroad.
He never-ever turns his cellphone off. He wants to always be available in case
something happens. But this doesn’t help his relationship with my mom, and I
think more importantly, it doesn’t help the relationship he has with himself.
Ariana Huffington of the Huffington Post recently shared how at night she
sets a nice and relaxed atmosphere in her bedroom, sometimes lighting candles,
etc. She doesn’t allow her cellphone to enter the bedroom.
Let me repeat: she doesn’t allow her cellphone to enter the bedroom. She says
that if she finds that her cellphone had somehow infiltrated the sacred space of
the bedroom she “gently escort him out of the room.”
I like that.
That feels to me like she is getting it.
We have to set clear boundaries. If we don’t, everyone will have a piece of us.
Will you set a clear boundary? It’s a must if you want to begin practicing
habits of self-love, which in turn will change your inner dialogue to a more
loving one. The benefits are huge: happiness, joy, authenticity, a feel of ease. But
you need to start from setting clear, very clear boundaries.

PRIORITIZING YOURSELF When you prioritize yourself first, you have
enough time to feel good, to feel replenished. You fill your cup fully. Then, when
your cup is full, you can give others from the overflow.
Never ever give others from what you don’t have.
This means that saying ‘no’ must become comfortable for you.
It wasn’t for me.
I used to say ‘yes’ for everything, modeling after both my father and my
mother. It was not good for me. In my mid twenties I had several charities I was
volunteering for, being on the boards of directors, while doing all kinds of other
stuff too.
It was fulfilling. But simultaneously it was draining. How could that be?
Well, whenever someone would give me a good word, show me that they
appreciate me, I’d feel much better. Also, when I saw that someone, a student of
mine (I taught the language Esperanto to new students), a mentee of mine (I
volunteered as Big Brother for a kid), or the organization as a whole made a
progress – that progress would fill me and make me pleased.
But what when there was no appreciation from others, or when no progress
was to be seen? Then I’d feel drained, exhausted, unappreciated, and really tired.
At the time I was taking a part in a “mastermind group”, which basically
meant a group of individuals that were into personal growth. The six of us would
meet on Skype every other week, would share some of our challenges, and offer
advice and encouragement to one another. It was quite powerful, because I took
many lessons from it.
One of the lessons I took was an exercise. I think I lamented out loud the fact
that I’m sooooo busy and exhausted. When I was asked why, I gave a partial
(very partial) list of all the things I was involved with.
It was then that one of the participants in the mastermind group said to me
she’d like me to try an exercise for the following two weeks.
“What is it?” I asked, not wanting to add yet another chore to my list.
“Once a day say ‘no’ to something.”
“Say ‘no?’”
“Yeah,” she said, “it sounds simple, but it’s powerful.”
“No,” I said, “it doesn’t sound simple at all.”
But I liked that idea. So I decided to give it a shot.
Three days later I was still not practicing this exercise. I felt that there was no
opportunity to say no. But I kept thinking about it.
Also, I received an email from the mastermind, listing each person’s
commitment till our next meeting. I was already behind on my commitment.
“We need volunteers,” the email read, “among you Big Brothers, to help
setting up the picnic next Friday.”
I looked at it, and triumphantly pressed the Reply. “Hi Rickie, I’m excited
about the picnic, but unfortunately I won’t be able to help.”
Before sending I added, “But if you need anything done that actual same day,
please tell me.”
I then deleted this added sentence.
And then I wrote it back. “If you need anything on that actual Friday, let me
know.”
And then I deleted it. Fuck, learn how to say ‘no’!
Then I hit “Send” and jumped off my seat – “I did it!”
And this was just the beginning.

That's how I called my own shots.”

SEEKING YOUR OWN APPROVAL
You got to be worried more about how YOU will FEEL than about what
OTHERS will THINK.
When I wrote that email to Rickie saying I won’t be able to help, I
immediately thought, “How will she respond? What will she think of me?”
But over the years, the more I learnt to say no since then, the more I realized
it’s not important what she will think. I’m not responsible for her thoughts.
In fact, if she’s smart, Rickie may think, “Wow, good for him, he knows how
to say no.”
Or she may think, “Great, Jonathan knows how to set his boundaries. That’s a
good modeling for his young brother he’s mentoring.”
Or she may think, “Jonathan – wow, I should learn from him. He said ‘no’ but
did it in such a fine manner.”
Whatever she thinks, it’s none of my business.
These days I got into a really healthy discipline: I don’t say ‘no’ and I don’t
say ‘yes’. I say, “Can I get back to you tomorrow on that?”
“But Jonathan,” I may hear the person asking for the help saying back, “I
need to know now, and I can’t imagine who I’ll have to ask if YOU won’t be
able to help me!”
“Yeah, I totally understand,” I answer, “but I’m sorry, I have to look into what
I’ve already committed to, and see, I don’t want to promise you and then
disappoint you, you see? So let me get back to you on that tomorrow.”
This already sets the stage for the OPTION that I may say no.
In the following 24 hours, the person who asked me has to come up with
some alternate solutions, in case I will say no.
Then, when I do say no, or when I do offer to do just a small part in my
proposed chore, the person on the other side is not surprised.
Try it, it works wonders. Next time a person asks you to help with something,
even if you’re SURE you’ll say yes, tell them you’ll get back to them on that
tomorrow.
It makes people respect you more.

THE TRUTH
If you are afraid about saying ‘no’ to others more often, and the consequences it
may bring, let me NOT reassure you.
In fact, let me make you worried, because we need to look into that.
When you begin to shine, some people won’t like it. When you follow your
own desires, some people will be upset. We spoke about that.
Some people will actually leave. Yep. They will actually find you unhelpful.
And that’s ok.
This might cause a little bit of reorganizing of your personal and social life.
You want people around you who are supportive of you because of who you
ARE rather than because of what you DO.
And if they leave, you might get into a panic attack. You might be afraid of
you not having friends. And you might be afraid of not having the old
gratification that you used to receive.
But ultimately, over time, this will do you a great service.
You can’t grow to fully love yourself and embrace yourself when you are
constantly trying to meet other people’s demands, and when you are being
measured by other people’s expectations.
With time you will find that the shift you had in your life was one of the best
things that happened to you.
Not that it’s going to be easy.
You might go through a time of a separation anxiety. You might want to run
back and say, “OK, OK, I’ll put myself second, but please come back!”
The reason I’m saying this is that I personally found myself in this situation
more than once. And now I am feeling much lighter, of people, even very close
to me, who expected me to act in one very certain way, and when I didn’t, they
simply left in a storm.
I have one relationship with a close friend, we were like brothers. But he
constantly was assisted by me. Not only technical things, but also emotionally.
He dominated most of the conversations, and was quite negative. He also
expected of me to always be there, while when I was asking for him to be there
for me, he was quite busy, and I needed “to understand.”
Now, I’m not blaming him. I was the one to follow his direction, and not put
any boundary. I basically fulfilled his dream of a best friend, while he didn’t
fulfill mine, nor were he any close.
But I put him on a pedestal, and, well, when someone is on a pedestal, it may
cause you to break your neck.
When it became too much for me, and my emotional ‘neck’ was breaking, I
tried to speak with him. He asked me to do a favor. And I felt like he was asking
it in a too matter-of-fact manner, not really REQUESTING, but almost
ASKING.
So I tried to say, “Well, I’d like to help, but I must say that recently I’ve been
feeling like I do for you, and that you don’t really… appreciate it.”
Unfortunately he wouldn’t have it.
“Let me not go into everything I’ve done for you,” he said, “and we’re
friends, I’m just asking for you to help me in this little thing!”
“Yeah,” I said, “but last time I helped you didn’t even say thank you, or
acknowledged the time I had put into it. You actually showed your
dissatisfaction with HOW I did it. And it was a FAVOR I was doing for you.”
He expected me to be a certain way. And based on many years of our
relationship, and on the help he had given me early on, he thought that I had
MUCH to do and was far from having the luxury of expressing my
dissatisfaction.
And so, after I told him I felt that he didn’t appreciate all that I was doing, he
basically said, “Man, this is too much for me to hear right now, and I’m also in a
really busy time these days.”
“But,” I said, “I want us to speak about it, and see, and for each of us to
express what he feels, and hopefully—”
“Well, I can’t right now, so, I just CAN’T, right now.”
He hasn’t called since.
I texted him, and he said he was swamped and ‘taken aback’ by what I said,
and that it’s going to take him some time.
“I’m here.” I wrote back and haven’t heard from him since.
Was I too offensive?
Was I wrong to expect him to listen?
Should I have helped again, at least this one time?
“No way!” Hallel told me. “You’ve been complaining about this relationship
since I know you, for four years. Give him the time. You did what you had to
do.”
“But,” I struggled, “what if he won’t…?”
“Then he won’t,” Hallel said, “and you would know that you SPOKE and said
how you FELT, and that he wasn’t willing to listen.”
It still hurts me to write that.
And I still hope he will call and we could make the relationship work. We
were good friends. I believe we can make it work, if I would know to put my
boundaries.
So what I’m trying to say here is that yes, sometimes it might cause a havoc
when you are standing for your self. If you insist on putting yourself first and
giving yourself first, some will find it troubling.
But it’s OK.
It’s OK.

YOU ARE THE ANSWER And so YOU are the answer for your question.
You are the cause of your suffering and your pain. You can choose to think
differently and act differently, and then reap the fruits.
You can start by making a list, each time completing the following sentence:
If I truly loved myself, I would…
I would, for example, walk in nature more.
I would smile to myself more in the mirror.
I would buy myself some new clothes and get read of some old ones.
I would publish more things on Facebook.
I would tell myself that my books and paintings are GREAT.
I would wash away thoughts about what I “should” have done in certain
circumstances.
I would eat better.
I would say ‘no’ more often (still working on it!) I would play the guitar
more.
I would dance more.
I would sit at the end of the workday and write my accomplishments, rather
than focus on what I haven’t finished yet.
I would take a nice long bath with candles and relaxing music.
Do you see what I’m saying here? YOU must be the solution. YOU must give
to yourself.
The world will then notice that you treat yourself better. That you walk in a
certain way, talk in a certain way, carry yourself in a certain way – that you love
yourself.
And the world will follow suit.
I promise.
Now take a moment to think for yourself: If I truly loved myself, I would…

SELF-LOVE VS. CONCEIT
One of the questions I hear all the time is “isn’t being all that loving towards
yourself a bit… conceited?”
If I then ask and inquire, these are the typical phrases I hear: “Well, I just
don’t want to come out as too full of myself, you know?” Or “I hate people that
are boastful and conceited, so I don’t want to be like them.”
Alright. Let’s make things clear, as you may be thinking these same thoughts.
Self-love is the furthest thing from conceit, or having excessive pride in
oneself. Self-love is not necessarily anything others will notice from the outside.
If anything, they will notice that you FEEL better and are DOING better, or that
you RADIATE love and kindness. They will not, and I repeat, they will NOT
think that you are being arrogant if you are treating yourself well.
On the contrary. I think that arrogance and conceit are a result of not loving
yourself ENOUGH. When you really love yourself, you don’t feel the need to
prove yourself or to boast of your successes, because you feel really good and
satisfied. You feel loved, and you are not starving for other people’s approval.
When someone isn’t loving themselves enough, they will long for all kinds of
external validation, such as being called by their credentials, receiving the credit
for other people’s work, having others listen to them excessively, etc. These are
not signs of self love, but of a deprivation of self love.
Basically, by judging them and saying, “boy, is he arrogant or what” or “she’s
so full of herself and of big-headed” you are quick to make a common mistake.
We all make this mistake.
We judge the external behavior and assume that it means that the person is an
admirer of themselves.
But the truth is that often, well actually let me say ALWAYS, the case is the
reverse. If they truly and wholly loved themselves, they would have insisted on
sharing love with others, from their overflow.
As they don’t have enough love, and do not know of how to give it to
themselves, they seek it from others.
So be loving and accepting of such behavior, as long as it does not take from
your own wellbeing. Send these people love in your thoughts – they are just
abandoned children seeking for validation and approval, like we all do. Their
case is just a sadder one.
Your fear of being labeled as aloof or a snub due to loving yourself must be
called off here. As a result of loving yourself you will only be able to love
others, be more patient and kind to others, and in turn, be more loved by others.
And besides, we’ve been through it. Even if you practice self-love and selfcare, and some people don’t like it, it’s none of your business. You have to set a
model for them, and for all of us, as to how to treat ourselves.
Please give us a good model, OK?

pat on the back and say,
'That was cool.
That made me feel good.'”

yourself a pat on the back. If you can't
do that, you can't be objective about
your work. You can't be conceited or

either.”
—Jack Reynor
Irish actor
I WILL LOVE MYSELF WHEN…
One common mistake we all make is the notion that “I will love myself, WHEN
I will finish my degree” or “I will give myself love when I get this promotion” or
“When my children appreciate me, that’s when I will be at ease.”
Bad bad baaaad. This is not good at all – yet we all do that.
Why can’t we decide that TODAY we’ll be appreciative of ourselves? Why
can’t we begin to count our many accomplishments this very day? Why do we
wait?
Again, I think this is something we need to be TAUGHT. And as our parents
didn’t know how to do it themselves, we simply copied them.
But now we know better.
Now we are older and wiser.
It’s time for us now to take a conscious decision to really love who we are.
There’s nothing bad in doing that.
There’s no ‘self-love-police’ that will come and chase us down and put us in
jail.
This reminds me of how once, when I was about six years old or so, I began
taking few coins from my dad’s pants, hanging in the bathroom at night.
Those coins, boy, were they useful! They got me some nice treats in the
grocery store, I was in HEAVEN.
Then my mom opened my pencil box one day, and found those coins.
“Who gave these to you?” she asked with a severe look.
“I… no one!” I said and tried to walk away.
My mom then grabbed my arm and raised her voice. “Where did you get these
coins?”
My poor mom. As an adult I realize she was probably afraid someone was
giving the coins to me in return for some unhealthy conduct. Or something like
that. She was really worried.
“I…” I finally whispered, as I knew what I did was wrong, “I got them out of
dad’s pants, hanging on the bathroom door…”
By then my mom was flustered and emotional, and she said, “Why did you
take it? Are you a thief? Do you want me to call the police and have them take
you to children’s prison? Do I need to call the police?”
“No…” I said, about to cry.
“Then promise me you won’t take any coins without permission!”
“I promise!” I muttered and thought, please, just let me go!
She then left me alone.
I felt really bad.
And for years, I was afraid of that children’s police will come and take me to
children’s prison.
Few years ago I spoke about it with my mom. She did not remember. She
apologized. I explained she could have spoken more softly. We later hugged.
But I think that as grown ups, we still walk with our parents’ reprimand in our
head.
Well, let me tell it to you now. No police will come and take you if you
acknowledge yourself and love yourself.
Nothing good is going to come out of you always striving to be your best at
the expense of your own wellbeing.
Please, let go of the unreal expectations you have set for yourself. The road of
self-battering is not a good one for you. Today you can leave that road and take
the path of self-love, self-respect and self-nurturing.
The only question is, will you?

STOP WITH THE CRICITISM
What if today was your last day here on earth? Would you still treat yourself the
way you treat yourself right now?
Most people’s answer to that question is “nope.” If indeed this was your last
day, you would most likely express more love, not only to others, but also to
yourself.
If this is your last day, you’d probably throw away your thoughts such as,
“I’m always such a loser” or “here you are late again!” or “I should have seen it
coming, what an awful mom I am!”
You would be EASIER on yourself. You would allow yourself to be a little
more content with yourself.
The only purpose of your self-reprimand, if there is any purpose, is for you to
change in the future as a result of your reprimand.
But what if… you didn’t have any future? What if this day WAS indeed your
last day. Surely, one day it WILL be your last day. So why are you criticizing
yourself so much?
Let it go. Let harsh words go. Let expressions of exasperation with yourself
become something of the past. Let all your explanations of why you are not as
good or successful as you would have liked become old leaves that have fallen
from the tree. Let it go.
Even as I’m writing this book, the voice of self-criticism comes to me often. It
says, “Who the heck is going to read this book anyhow?” and “it’s a bunch of
ideas you put together and dare calling it a book?” and “it will be quite
transparent to your readers that you don’t know what you’re talking about!”
Yep. My inner voice still can go off on a tangent sometimes. It’s still not
where I’d like it to be.
But it’s definitely WAY better than it used to be.
I can quietly tell it, “Thank you so much for your advice, but really, love, no
need. I’m OK.”
And instead of fighting back, like it always did, these days it says, “Oh, OK
then, tell me if you need me.”
Also, as a way to practice what I’ve been preaching, if you indeed think that I
don’t know what I’m writing about, or that this book is a bunch of foolish ideas,
then, thank you – but what you think about me or this book is NONE of my
business. I LOVE it. And I LOVE MYSELF. Godammit! I do. I struggled to get
here, and I pat myself on the back, kiss myself on the front, and embrace myself
on the inside.

BECOMING A STAR
I recently watched an interview in which Oprah Winfrey interviewed First Lady
Michelle Obama. At one point during the interview Oprah commented, “Yes, I
believe in service, I believe in helping people, I want people to feel fulfilled and
empowered in their life,” and then added, “but still some days I think, it’s just
cool to be me.”
The audience then laughed and cheered. Oprah’s words may sound like she
was a little full of herself. But her words came to serve as inspiration for all of
us. We all need to treat ourselves as if we were stars, as if it was “really cool to
be us.”
You may say, “If I were Oprah, I would think it’s cool to be me!”
But I think we all have things to be grateful for, and reasons to think we are
quite cool. Here, let’s do a quick exercise: What makes you “cool?”
My turn: Well, I’m cool because I am a really fun dad, and I do all kinds of
fun stuff with my baby girl Sarah.
Your turn:
My turn: I’m super cool because I dance pretty well and I feel pretty free.
Your turn:
My turn: I’m cool cause I have a really fine smile. Really. I have a great
smile.
Your turn:
My turn: I’m cool because I dare to be vulnerable and express my emotions.
Your turn:
My turn: I’m cool because I’m just cool. I am cool, the epitome of cool, I’m
what you’ll find in the dictionary under Coolness, I’m cool cool cool real cool
cool indeed. Yeah!
Your turn: (let’s see you after that!)
My turn: I’m cool because I lead my life. When it was time for us to move to
the north I found the proper house for us to rent and signed the lease, even
though Hallel wasn’t sure. Now she thanks me for acting fast, and she loves the
house. That’s pretty cool – acting and daring to take brave decisions.
Your turn:
My turn: Well, we can go on for a while, right? Here’s my last cool reason.
I’m cool because I AM. I’m cool because I was BORN. I’m cool because I have
this body to explore this planet with. I’m cool because I’m the outcome of this
one daring sperm to hit this egg and make ME. I’m cool because I don’t NEED
to find any reason why I’m cool. I’m cool because I AM.
Your turn:
Now that we finished, why won’t you go back and actually do this exercise? ;)

“BUT YOU DON’T
KNOW MY STORY!”
One of the thoughts you may have on your mind, “Well, that’s very nice for
YOU, Jonathan, but you don’t know MY story.”
That’s true. But quite frankly, if your story is what keeps you from
blossoming to be your WHOLE self, then I wouldn’t want to hear it.
We all have stories. True, some people’s stories are more difficult than others.
Many people have to go through various forms of abuse, which definitely lowers
one’s self esteem to the floor. It’s really a HUGE challenge to overcome having
experienced abuse of any sorts.
But I have come to believe that everything we’ve been through was an
intentional thing. That it all was part of a plan to make us who we are.
My father hit me few times. I wouldn’t call it abuse, but it definitely wasn’t
something I like to remember, or that I intend to pass on to my own kids.
For years I held it against him. And I was afraid of him to an extent.
Nowadays I see it, though, as one of the most important things that shaped me
to be who I am. I am one of the most sensitive guys you’d meet – I feel people’s
pain, I can easily relate, and I allow myself to experience and hurt WITH them.
I think part of this gift was actually the negative experience of having my
father go after me and slapping me in my bottom. It was painful, burningly
painful. And humiliating too.
But today I think it made me part of who I am.
When I was young my mom would often burst out in shouting and yelling,
often being quite unkind in her punishments. What was so unique was that I
couldn’t expect it. She was altogether a really loving mom, warm and
nourishing. And yet, at times, she could be really mad and unreasonable, to the
extent I couldn’t converse with her, but had to just be silent.
This experience of my mom possibly having the possibility of having a
sudden fit, made me become extra aware. I tried to see in her movement and her
face whether she was tired or bothered, which were the indications that
something may erupt.
I learnt to watch her move, watch her facial expressions, her eyebrows, her
forehead, even the slightest move of her lips: were they tight? Tight-ish? Tense?
And how about her shoulders? And her breath?
I learnt to be extra sensitive, and I knew to walk away fast when she was
going to have a fit. And all of that when I was five years old or so.
Years later, I was at the seventh grade, and took part in the school’s student
council. We were students from the seventh grade all the way up to the twelfth
grade. Once we were given a lecture by a teacher who specialized in body
language.
She showed us different body postures with a overhead projector. There were
many. She then asked us, each time, what did we think: was this person (a) upset
(b) worried (c) scared, or (d) surprised.
Some of the slides were easy, some were more complicated. She showed us
some twenty of them, including ones of couples (were they resentful or loving?
Worried or hopeful?).
Each of us wrote the answers down after each slide, and at the end the teacher
told us the right answer, and asked us to check mark the question if we got the
correct answer. “Now count how many you got right.”
I counted. She then asked, “how many of you had ten correct answers or
less?” No one raised their hand. “How about eleven?”
Two students raised their hands. “Good job!” the teacher said. “And twelve?”
Few more raised their hands. The same was with 13 correct answers. Then for
14 there was only two people.
“Anyone got above 14 correct answers?” the teacher asked.
I looked at my sheet, alarmed. It said “18”.
I said nothing. Yet Rinat, a 12
th grader who was the head of the student
council, sat next to me and glanced at my paper. “Common,” she whispered.
But I didn’t want to say anything.
“Jonathan has!” Rinat said triumphantly, “he has 18 correct answers!”
The teacher looked flustered, and came and hovered above my sheet. “Wow,”
she said with a smile, “that’s impressive. Now let’s go over each one and try to
see what were the physical indications of each state.”
Even today, remembering this lecture, I blush.
We looked at each slide, and she asked what made us think the person was
happy or sad. There were the obvious things which everyone recognized, and
then there were more subtle things. The teacher was impressed with my softspoken comments.
I believe it was due to having somewhat of a turbulent childhood. I developed
skills that I link and attribute to the unfortunate circumstances of my mother
throwing incidental fits.
Now, would I have preferred that those fits didn’t happen? Probably. Am I
upset by them? Not so much, not anymore.
Each and every experience you had brought you to this moment. Each and
every difficult moment made you who you are now. Embrace your whole self.
Embrace all of your experiences, good and bad.
Yes, you are right. I DON’T know your story. But author Lisa Nichols says:
“Your mess is your message.” Make your ‘Story’, that thing that holds you back,
the foundation on which you climb to become taller.
It’s up to you. Maya Angelou did it, Oprah Winfrey did it, and YOU can do it
too. Rewrite your story. Actually sit and WRITE it. Find out ALL the
advantages, big and small, that came from the fact they left you. Write down
everything you learned from being estranged from your child. Write down why
your first spouse was valuable to you nevertheless. Write down why that cousin
actually did you a service.
I know it hurts. But you OWE it to yourself. Rewrite your story.

LETTING GO OF RESENTMENT
One of the greatest obstacles to us loving ourselves, like we should, is
resentment.
We think that if we let go of the anger and blame, we become “collaborators”
with the perpetrator.
Let’s have a look at that.
In the ninth grade I joined Israel’s most prestigious art school. There I
majored in theatre. It was quite an extensive program, one similar to that
portrayed in the movie “Fame.” We had dance lessons, voice lessons, costume
lessons, make up and masks lessons, and, of course, acting lessons.
The acting teacher we were given was Jacob. He was considered one of
Israel’s greatest acting and drama teachers. The other teachers told us this fact
several times. He was the founder of the street theatre and performance
movement in Israel. He studied in France with the famed Jacques Lecoq, and
was quite well known himself in Israel.
The only problem was that he didn’t like me at all.
Jacob had strong opinions. He was a very charismatic man, then in his late
sixties. He had fiery eyes. And when he said something, you believed him.
For some reason, I wasn’t his cup of tea. While most students got their crams
of compliments, no leftover crams were handed to me. He thought I was too this
and too that. He thought I was too sensitive. Not much of a young man for him.
He marveled at some of the more manly looking boys in class, and said, “I
can sit and watch you and melt from your fire,” and then he’d look at us, “can’t
you?”
And we would all nod. Yeah, he’s right. Fire, right.
Oh, how I longed to be said I had any sort of fire. I worked and labored hard.
Each assignment, such as watching a cat walk and later being able to mimic it
exactly – I would go down to the street and look for cats, watch their every
movement. Then practice in my room.
“Not that way, Jonathan!” Jacob would exclaim exasperated. We had white
masks on, with only the eyes showing. I looked at him, this was supposed to be a
silent exercise, and we only now began, why does he pick me to critic? I tried to
say, “But I studied it!” but my voice sounded thick through the mask with no
opening for the mouth.
“Now, listen to me,” he commanded, “right hand forward, then left knee
forward, now left hand forward, now right knee forward… that’s right.”
That’s exactly what I did. Why did he have to…? Why?
Once I stood on stage, alone, him watching me with the rest of the class. Then
he said, “but you have no presence, no command of the stage…” and he put his
hand on his forehead in exasperation.
What was so frustrating is that all the other kids adored him. Even the
students from the higher grades. They said, “He may be tough, but wait till next
year, everything will fall into place.”
Shifra, my favorite teacher, said, “Jacob is a genius. You students should feel
honored to be studying with him.” Everyone nodded.
I tried to approach him once before class. When he saw my face he looked
tired. “Yes, Jonathan?”
“I…” I said, “I want to know what should I do to be… better, to be a better
actor.”
Jacob sighed and looked at me. “The thing is, boy, that you don’t have any
presence. You are transparent on stage, I can see through you.”
I already heard that. “But what can I do?”
“Eat bread, lots of bread.”
“Bread?”
“Yes, bread. Now, let’s go into class.”
I walked after him, bewildered. Bread?
Yet no matter how much bread I ate, his attitude towards me didn’t change.
At the end of the year he said, “Students, I have an announcement to make. I
will not be continuing with you next year.”
Everyone gasped. Me too. I was looking forward to seeing how he could ‘put
it all together’ like I was told so many times – ‘Jacob will tare you apart, to then
saw you back together as a whole actor in your second year, it will all fall into
place.’
We looked at him with amazement. “But why?” some of us asked.
“Well, many reasons,” he said, “but you will be fine. They will bring you a
good teacher, one that will start where we stopped.”
To myself I was thinking, ‘but I’m torn open. You promised to complete
this…’
The next year teacher didn’t know Jacob’s hierarchy of who was a brilliant
actor and who wasn’t. Somehow, by grace from above, he liked me. Slowly, my
self esteem began healing.
Few years ago I met with a friend from school, whom I haven’t seen for a
decade or so. We had coffee in a café in north Tel Aviv. And we spoke among
other things about school.
I was surprised to hear that she had lots of criticism at the school. “Teachers
exercising their authority in a wrong way,” she said.
I wondered what she meant. For me, the story and the emotions attached to
that Jacob teacher were stuffed into a compartment in my heart I was only tiptoeing around, afraid to awaken any old hurts.
“Well, do you remember how Albert, the choreography teacher used to light
his cigarette in class?” she asked.
Oh yes. “Yeah, that was quite stupid.”
“Or how the musical director told us we are ‘a bunch of useless armatures’
and that we should ‘fuck off’?”
“Oh my god.”
“And don’t get me started about Jacob.”
I looked at her. Actually, I thought, I’d like for you to get started about Jacob.
Back in the day I could confide my pain in no one. And I hadn’t really opened it
or touched it since then.
“What do you remember of Jacob?” I asked.
“He was just so…” she was looking for the right word, “cruel.”
“Cruel?” I asked. Was she not using a too harsh of a word?
“What?” she looked at me, surprised, “don’t you remember how he talked to
you, of all people?”
“I do…” I said. It felt so good to know that she noticed. “It’s… nice to see
that you took note.”
“Took note?! It was as visible as it could be. Do you remember that comment
he made about your… ‘sausage’?”
I couldn’t not laugh. “Sausage? Nope…”
“Wow,” she stared at me, “I can’t believe you don’t remember it. You were
standing on stage, in front of all of us, and he asked you,” Michelle lowered her
voice, ‘Do you have a sausage down there or a hot dog bun?’”
Wow. I remembered it. All of a sudden it came to me.
Jacob was not stupid. At the time I wasn’t quite sure myself.
I looked at Michelle. “I remember.”
“Do you remember how it continued?”
I thought for a moment. “No…”
Michelle sighed. Everyone became quite, and he asked you again, ‘Do you
have a sausage or a bun?’
“You said, ‘a sausage’, and he said, ‘good.’ And then he said, ‘now, is your
sausage interested in buns, or in other sausages?’
I looked at Michelle, “Oh my god. I can’t believe he said that.”
“Neither do I,” Michelle said.
We both sat there in silence. I tried to remember, what did I answer? Probably
that I was interested in buns, of course.
Thinking of it made me feel a little sick to my stomach, and then a wave of
sadness washed over me.
I sighed.
I remembered how some three years before, at the age of 25, I went to a
meditation retreat. In it, the teacher asked us to forgive everyone who had ever
hurt us.
I asked myself then, ‘who should I forgive?’ and then Jacob’s face came
before me.
I said, ‘I forgive you.’
But then, in front of Michelle in that Tel Aviv café, I felt so much anger at this
stupid old man, terrorizing me in front of the whole class.
Which answer should I have given him? ‘I don’t know’? ‘Well, I’m still
struggling with this question myself?’ or ‘Well, my last girlfriend told me I must
be gay, because I told her of this wet dream I had about me and an imaginary
guy, so…?’
Michelle looked at me. “He was exercising his power over you in a way that
was not OK.”
“Yeah,” I said.
Now, it’s time to forgive. Really forgive. Follow me.

FORGIVENESS EXERCISE
Let’s continue from where we stopped in the last chapter. I hope this inner
dialogue I have with myself will serve as an example for you as to how to truly
forgive.
So, Jacob. I resent the fact that you abused the power and the authority you
had over me as a teacher. I resent the fact that you treated me badly, marked me
as a student to pester and to taunt.
I resent the fact that you called me names, and treated me disrespectfully. I
resent that you did all that. That you abused, really abused your position as a
teacher. A teacher is supposed to nurture, guide, direct, and you did NOT do that.
You messed up. You failed in your task as a teacher.
Whatever philosophy you supposedly had behind your dumb actions and
statements, I find it faulty. Students should not be put down in order to ‘lift them
up’ later. It’s dumb; I strongly and adamantly disagree with this method. It’s
wrong. Wrong.
And not only did you abuse your power, you did it in front of the whole class.
You humiliated me and terrorized me, really, in front of the whole class. That
was not fair. If you had any constructive critic you could have given it to me in
private.
I resent the fact you smiled when the students chuckled. I resent that it gave
you a sense of power and authority, to humiliate one of your students, less than
half your age – less than a quarter of your freakin’ age!
I am angry with your misguidance, with your snobbery, with how you implied
all the time that you had all the answers, and that we were just in our beginning
stage. You did not empower me. You disempowered me, and I allowed you to do
that.
Ahhh…!
I strongly condemn your behavior. I strongly oppose your teaching methods. I
am strongly frustrated with your abuse of your power.
In fact, I’m disappointed with you. You had the power to lift us all. To
empower us. To help us see that even if one student is different than the rest –
that we should love them and respect them too. You had a great teaching
opportunity and you MISSED it. Big time.
Kids are tender. I was freaking fourteen years old. I was tender, soft, easy to
mold. And you, with your unwashed fingers, molded a part of my soul into not
really loving myself.
I see the residues of your weak behavior in my system. I see how I am still
afraid to seem feminine at times, just so I won’t be caught by your unloving
eyes. I see that I am afraid that I’m not manly enough, not according to your
standards.
But let me tell you, love, that I am a man just as much as you. In fact, if I had
to choose between being you or me, I would choose me.
I don’t need to pester other people to feel important. I try to accept each and
every person, no matter how much I oppose some sides in them. I don’t have to
put anyone down to feel better, and if I catch myself, then I apologize.
I am sickened by your unintelligent conduct. I am saddened by how messed
up you were.
I am appalled by your inability to distinct between what’s right and what’s
wrong.
And yet, with all of that, I choose to let you go.
I choose to let your memory go. I choose to wash away your disrespectful
comments, your manic behavior. I choose to let it go.
Jacob, I look into your eyes and I see a damaged man. A damaged kid, who
was not loved and accepted for who he was. I look into your soul and I see pain.
I see anger and rage, and beneath it all I see pain.
I’m sorry I took your pain with me. This is your pain. All I can do is show
you love.
Yes, I’m still a little afraid of you. But I choose to show you love, to send you
love and healing. I understand that if you knew better, if you were more aware of
yourself, and of your own pain, you wouldn’t have done what you did.
I know that had you known better, you would have empowered me. You
would have told me how great I am. You would have never implied that I am
transparent, but instead told me that my light shines so bright, it impinges your
eyes.
You would have told me that I am great. That I will go far in life. You would
have told me I should take my time and experiment with girls and boys and not
worry about anything, let my whole self come forth.
You would have told me, had you been bigger and stronger, that you see great
talent in me. That I bring my whole self to the stage, and that you cannot stop
yourself from loving me and wishing the best for me.
I would have appreciated that.
Jacob, I choose to release you, for once and for all. You have no dominion
over me. You hold no authority over me. I am now, officially, in this moment,
letting you go.
I hereby forgive you for all of your wrongdoings.
More so, I forgive myself. I forgive my 14-years-old self for having given you
the power. I forgive myself for not seeing through your feigned and known that
you too are scared and afraid inside.
I forgive myself and embrace myself for not knowing that you were wrong.
That being a true man means not to act in a certain machoistic way, but to act in
a way that is authentic and congruent for each person.
I choose to love all men, all people, machoistic, gentle, manly or feminine.
Above all, I choose to love myself, my whole self.
Finally, Jacob, well, let me thank you. I thank you for giving me this
experience. Through this experience I learnt so much about myself and about
life.
I thank you for teaching me that sometimes being in position of authority can
make people a little drunk with power and out of line. It’s a good lesson to know,
and feel pity for them for not being able to avoid the toxic elements that may
come with power.
I thank you, Jacob, for doing this to me at such a young age, while I was still
so impressionable. It made me realize, through my own experience, just how
tender a teenage soul is.
I thank you, Jacob, for opening me up to emotions of self-loathing and selfhatred. While I do not intend to use them, I am thankful for having experienced
them, and for having the ‘contrast’ to know what I want to feel instead: self
acceptance and self love.
I thank you, Jacob, for saying that I’m transparent. In many ways, I’ve tried to
defy your statement and your prophecy. I have worked hard and labored much to
achieve things I hold dear to my heart. It may be that your statement has actually
pushed me to go further in life.
I thank you, Jacob, for choosing me of all people in the class. I would have
felt really bad for any other student had you picked them for your exhibition of
your self-loathing. I thank you because I could endure it. I did.
I thank you, Jacob, for instilling a secret feeling within me, that if someone is
picking on me, that they might be jealous. I thank you for making me understand
over the years that when people pick on others it’s out of their own demons and
self-hatred. I thank you for this valuable lesson.
I thank you for teaching me what it feels when someone doesn’t accept you
for who you are. Through this feeling of being rejected by you, I developed a
hunger to make everyone feel included and loved. And this hunger drives me to
work, lead, speak, write. I thank you for instilling this hunger in me.
I thank you for teaching me that I should never, NEVER give someone else
the power over me. It took me many years to understand it, but I now do. I feel
pity for you, and I choose to feel pity over every person who made me feel bad
as a mean to bring themselves pleasure. I see through that. I thank you for
helping me to see through that.
I also wish to thank you for knowing when to stop – I do believe, now that I
see your own wounds, that you could have carried on, and damaged me even
more. I appreciate that you did stop when you did. I bet it took some courage.
I wish to now express the words of the child in me. I wish to take the mask off
of me, literally, and to tell you, “Man, I feel so sorry for you, I feel pity for you.
Look at you, surrounded by kids, and for you to feel better about yourself, you
choose to put one of them down? Man, that’s so sad. I’m really sorry for you. I
send you healing and love. I feel your pain.”
I apologize to myself for having given you, you little poor you, the power
over me. What a mistake. I shall never let anyone have power over me. I shall
know the truth, in which we are all equal, and we are all one. I release you from
my dominion, and am willing to accept you only when your intentions are pure.
I apologize to myself. I love myself. I forgive you, Jacob. I see your pain. I do
love you. I’m sorry for having judged you all these years – sorry for me, and
sorry for you. I thank you for all that you have given me. May you be well, live a
long and happy life, and heal all your inner wounds. Amen.

LETTING GO OF SECRETS
We are entering one of the most important chapters in this book. Secrets.
But before we do, let’s close down what we went through in the last two
chapters about forgiveness. We understood that when we hold grudges and
resentment, we are actually hurting ourselves; that through forgiving we are
sending ourselves free. I then took you through a long process in which I had an
inner dialogue, a sort of a letter, through which I led myself to forgiveness.
I cannot stress enough how much I’d like for you to do this process yourself.
You may need to forgive your mother, your father, your ex-spouse, your child,
your best friend, your teacher – and through that you will not let them off the
hook, but you will release yourself of all that weight.
Please contemplate doing it. Take some time and write such a letter to one of
the people you hold resentment against. You don’t need to give it to them – it’s
the writing process that matters, whether they are still alive or have deceased.
It is powerful, it is worth the time, and it liberates you. It helps you in turn to
love yourself more, which is why you are reading these lines.
Another HUGE tool that helps liberating you is the tool of letting go of
secrets.
Secrets weigh us down. I’m no expert on the subject, but I do really
appreciate it – as it’s one of the subjects people are least likely to speak of.
You will find thousands of books about success and about relationships – and
only few about shame, guilt and secrets.
Of the few, I think it’s worth while mentioning Brené Brown’s work – her
books are absolutely liberating for me, and have given me much of the needed
vocabulary to facilitate my own personal growth into becoming a better and
stronger me.
Brown recommends only sharing your secrets with a person that you value,
respect, and you know that they will not judge you, and that they will accept you
even of what you did that you are ashamed of.
Let me share a secret with you. It’s a secret that has weighed me down for
years and years. And now I’m willing to let it go.
In my youth, as you may have understood, I had some confusion about my
sexuality. I had a girlfriend at the age of 13, and she was marvelous and sweet –
we had great few first sexual experiences together, kissing, making out, and even
experiencing first orgasms.
Yet at the time I had a dream that really confused me, of me and another older,
imaginary boy, in the shower together. And it was pleasant.
When I told it to my girlfriend, Naomi, she was distorted. “You know what it
means, don’t you?” she asked with her eyes widened.
“No…” I said.
“It means you are GAY,” she said and began crying.
I cried too. I think.
We were thirteen.
But what was so odd was that I loved her a lot, and was attracted to her, I
could feel that very clearly in my pants. But, Naomi was a very smart girl. So I
guessed she was right.
Few months later our relationship ended, mostly because I felt she was very
jealous and rather controlling (this pattern was to reemerge several more times in
my relationships until I broke it piece by piece in my mid twenties).
Anyhow, we broke up. I moved to a new school, this fancy art school, in
which there were quite a few students openly identifying themselves as gay.
Good, I thought, time to experiment and SEE.
Neil, one of the kids in the class, was one of the most outspoken gay people.
We began talking, and eventually Neil spent the night in my family’s apartment.
We kissed. It was weird, exciting, frightening.
Given all I heard and sensed about gayness, was both scared and thrilled. It
was forbidden, it was for grown ups only.
But it didn’t develop into a relationship. Neil was nice, but I couldn’t see us
actually… dating. Few weeks later I hit it off with another girl from class, and
we became a couple. Her name was Dinah (all names made up of course to
protect people’s privacy and enabling me to speak FREELY).
Now, Dinah and I were together for nearly two years, all through the ninth
and tenth grade. We didn’t sleep together, but we did everything else we could. It
was great. It was a true love, big love with fond memories.
Then we broke up and there came a year of experimenting. Been with few
girls. Had my first sex, with someone I didn’t love, and it was l-o-u-s-y. The
furthest thing from what I had expected. Made me think that possibly I was gay
after all? I then had another encounter with a guy. And it was really good,
actually.
Meantime, of course, I told nobody. My older brother David, who knows
everything, told me that gay people are sick, and that it is really scary to be hit
on by one. He was hit on by one in a party, and boy, was that scary or what!
I then travelled to Canada at the age of 16 for two years. There I experimented
with a girl, then a boy. I was sure I was gay, but found it quite disappointing with
this one guy. Tried it again in Israel with another guy - was even worse.
Then came along Rebecca, and became my girlfriend, and later, for a limited
time, even my fiancé. We were together from my late teens into my twenties.
Then came few serious relationships (as you can see I’m a serious relationship
kind-a-guy), until I found Hallel, and now we are married and support one
another in our lives’ journey.
Why did I take you through the trouble of my romance and sexual escapades?
I’m actually a very private person, so it ain’t easy to write this.
The reason is that for me, this information is classified under the “never share,
never tell” file cabinet. Due to much cleaning labor, I have cleaned this cabinet
over the past few years. This is one of the only files left. I can’t see any other
files currently.
Yet this file - boy, it paralyzes me! Even as I write these words I’m a little
sweaty.
I did tell it to Hallel early on in our relationship, and she has been extremely
supportive. She even said that it made me who I am. And that I shouldn’t hide it.
But I kept hiding it from the world.
You see, to you, the fact that I’ve been with boys, men, for few times in my
teens may seem like “OK, where’s the secret?”
But to me the fact that I have been with BOYS for FOUR times in my teens is
just… HIDE and NEVER TELL kind of thing.
Let’s put things into context. I was born into a religious and ethnic tradition of
thousands of years, that basically denounces any one of my experimentations as
“SINS”. Like, sins-sins.
It’s a SIN.
And I have tons of religious friends. In fact, I myself find my religion very
intriguing. I freakin’ wrote a book about it.
Also, I have many religious Christian friends, and many religious Muslim
friends. To them too, this is a SINNNNN.
I hate to think that I have sinned.
Now, in my head, I don’t see it as a sin anymore. I have many gay friends too,
and I actually admire those who are openly gay.
As to me, I feel that if there was a line, a continuum, between being totally
gay or totally straight, I would be somewhere in the middle leaning towards the
straight. I do find women, personally, more attractive. But I find men attractive
too.
I explained to Hallel early on (in fact, to myself too), that being able
theoretically to go both ways does not mean I’m going to actually do something
about it. I fell in love with her as a person, and I’m not going to cheat, either
with a man nor with a woman. I’m quite monogamous, actually one of the most
monogamous people I know (in serious relationships since freakin’ age 13).
Back to the secret thing. Being told what I was told by my brother, being
often taunted in my youth for being gay (what can I say, I do have some
feminine aspects that I don’t want to hide by playing the role of a jarhead when
I’m not). Being told throughout my life that I SHOULDN’T even THINK of
same-sex stuff – this has been the reality in which I experimented.
It was difficult, at least for me.
I wanna be liked. I really do. By writing these words, by revealing this secret,
I know that some will be drawn closer, due to my authenticity and humanity,
while some will be drawn further, due to their judgment of what I did as
“wrong”.
I don’t want to push anyone further away.
Especially, I don’t want to push any person who is close to me away. What
will my brother say? And my religious teacher?
“Listen,” they may say, “it’s ok that you did it, you’ve mistaken. But to then
write about it?”
I want to write about it. I want to not have secrets weigh me down. I find
myself as a highly moralistic person, with strong values and ideals. And ideally,
I don’t think any of us should walk around carrying secrets.
Not that I think you need to take your secret and share it with the world like
I’m doing now. No. That’s my journey. You should have your own, whatever
feels liberating for YOU.
Studies have found that sharing a secret with only one person helps taking
away the negative side effects of having a secret.
What are these side-effects, you may ask. Well, let’s have a look at that.
A 2015 research entitled “Exploring the secrecy burden: Secrets,
preoccupation, and perceptual judgments”, which was published in the Journal
of Experimental Psychology, uncovered through four different studies that
keeping a secret makes you feel weighed down — literally — and even limits
your ability to get things done.
“Spending effort to keep your secret leads you to feel like you have less effort
and energy for other tasks, and so they seem more challenging”, the researcher,
Dr. Michael Slepian, wrote. “This is the same kind of outcome we see when
people are carrying physical burdens.”
What’s the fix? The researchers found that revealing a secret eliminated the
negative effects that harboring a secret can have.
“When you talk about your secret, you start thinking about it constructively
— processing it, making sense of it, learning how to cope with it — reducing
your preoccupation with that secret and taking you off the path of burden,”
Slepian wrote.
But what if your secret simply CAN’T be revealed? Well, the research
recommends “simply writing the secret down could still mitigate its negative
effects.”
And I want to add, find someone who you can trust, and ANY secret can be
revealed.
There is a great relief in revealing secrets. It makes you waaaaay lighter. Jack
Canfield says that hiding a secret is like being in the water, and trying to hide a
beach ball under the water. The beach ball wants to go up, and by you pressing it
down you are really tiring yourself.
I still need to do some processing regarding this secret of mine. But I’ve
decided that life isn’t worth living if I can’t simply be myself. And if some
people will walk away from me because they know I’ve been with guys – then,
let them walk away from me. I want only people that love me AS I AM,
accepting me AS I AM, and by that echoing my own love towards myself – AS I
AM.

THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS
Loving yourself is something that requires work. You need to unlearn much of
the crap you learnt and adopted along the way. And you need to relearn lots of
good stuff that you have forgotten.
I watch little kids carefully. From the moment they understand how mirrors
work, and once they’ve realized the figure in there is their own, children tend to
smile, laugh, giggle, even become embarrassed – all by the figure in the mirror.
Whereas I also watch adults carefully. When a person does not think you are
looking, they tilt their chin upwards (do it now with me): they tilt their chin
upward, squint their eyes gently, and look for flaws in their face. They raise their
eyebrows (do it now!), open their eyes widely to look at the wrinkles or makeup
around their eyes. Sometimes they might even check there’s nothing stuck
between their teeth. How will they do that? They will open their mouth widely
while tightening their jaw and teeth, and quickly look around.
Only few people end up being pleased with what they see. Those few people
tend to smile or nod at the end approvingly. Those are people I try to learn from.
But we all, ALL of us, forget that inside of us there’s a sweet little child. That
child is very sensitive, observant, and mindful of every gesture. When you squint
your eyes at them – they feel… judged. When you raise your eyebrows at them –
they feel intimidated. When you open your mouth and show your teeth – well,
they feel quite scared!
You may find this whole previous paragraph funny or amusing. It may be. But
I’m dead serious. You see yourself in the mirror few times a day – how often do
you smile at yourself? How often do you nod to yourself? Let me tell you that
the few super successful people I know, who love themselves and are just the
person you’d like to hang around with, actually do smile at themselves. They
actually do nod agreeably to themselves. They actually do.
I want to invite you to do that. Really. No biggie – just a quick smile, here and
there… will you be willing to try?
Remember, there’s a child in there. That child longs for your validation,
approval, consent, and more than anything – your love. Smile when you look at
yourself. Make sure not to leave the mirror, the bathroom, that sink or that
window, before you smile a grateful smile to yourself.

ADORING YOUR BODY
“Adoring your body” – now this may sound a little too much for you, possibly.
But this is one key element to loving yourself. When you love your whole self,
that includes your body too.
Yes, those wrinkles too. That weight, too. The chin, the nose, the big toes, the
hairy parts, the not big enough boobs, the too big-a-boob, those saggy parts, the
look of your penis (not to mention the size), the facial hair and those zits, the
color of your eyes, your hair (should have been different of course), etc. etc. etc.
I personally struggled with several things. First, my nose felt WAY too
‘Jewish’ to me. Felt big. Then, those moles, skin-tags and other wonderful parts.
Especially those moles with hair coming from them – why did you choose to
strike your root here, hair, and why so freaking dark? And why in the middle of
my face? Even before I began shaving I began clipping my mole’s dark black
hair. Splendid!
Then there were those eyebrows, growing one into the other. My girlfriend in
my teens (are you holding tight?) actually plucked the middle between my
eyebrows with those freakin’ tweezers. Oh man.
Then there are other parts that received my undivided attention. That is,
negative attention. I thought (and still think at times) I have too big of a butt.
Yeah, I know it’s a girl’s problem usually – but girls, you don’t have the
monopoly over that one. I love dancing, and sometimes when I see my butt in
mirror or in a video I cringe.
Sigh.
Also, as weird as it may sound, I have issues with my toes. Yep. I can never
make them feel and look clean enough. In the summer I’m a little embarrassed
walking with sandals. Oh yes.
Listen, I know my trouble may seem small to you, but it ain’t for me. At least,
it wasn’t.
Few years ago I did an exercise in the bathtub, in which I began appreciating
each and every part of my body. I also apologized to parts of my body that I
judged.
It looked more or less like that:
Oh my forehead, my lovely forehead. How I have judged you over the years.
I’m so sorry, really. (stroking the forehead) I really didn’t mean to not appreciate
you. Truth is that I relay appreciate you. So manly and tall, beautiful. And how
you keep this brain of mine working so well behind you, you protect it, keep it
safe. I appreciate that. I love you, forehead.
Oh my eyebrows, oh poor eyebrows, how much have I mistreated you! First,
let me apologize for the tweezers thing, for me not having enough self
confidence to tell Danielle not to pluck you middle hairs out. I’m really sorry.
Then, also, let me apologize for years of wishing you were different, thinner and
restricted. I’m sorry for that. I really appreciate you – giving me such a beautiful
frame, accentuating my face, protecting my eyes from dust and all kinds of
storms… I like how you serve as a couture line to my eyes, in a way making
them look bigger. I appreciate you.
Oh eyes of mine. Poor eyes. How much of a hard time I had given you. No,
you’re not too small. No, your color is not blah or average – you are stunningly
beautiful. Do you hear me? Stunningly beautiful eyes! I’m sorry for thinking you
were too small and shoved under my eyebrows. I’m sorry for criticizing your
performance, for lamenting constantly and complaining about your
nearsightedness. Oh, I’m really sorry. Truth is that with all the work I have
commanded you to perform, all the books I forced you to read even when you
were tired, the driving, the watching, everything – you are miraculous. Really
miraculous. I love you and I appreciate everything that you are doing for me. I
love that you see in full color, that you enable me to enjoy the visual
magnificence of this world. I appreciate you so much!
Nose, oh nose, dear nose of mine. I’m so sorry for giving you a hard time,
thinking you are too big. Even being embarrassed of my ‘Jewishness’. I love you
and appreciate you. You rock, nose, you do. You are so heroic, and grand, and
royal-looking. I love that you are so strong and manly. I also love how you
remind me of my heritage and my lineage. I feel like my ancestors are with me
when I look at you. Thank you for making me proud of who I am, and not giving
up on me even when I demanded you to shrink. I want you to do nothing but be
yourself.
Nostrils, oh nostrils.
Now, do you all get what I was doing?
I know you may want to read more, possibly in the future I’ll write a “love
your body” book, and we’ll go into depth there. But for now there’s nothing else
you need, really, before you can do this exercise yourself.
Of course it makes you embarrassed. What the heck, this whole book should
make you feel uncomfortable. Who am I writing it for??
Do this. Do this with your whole body. Here’s an example of how I spoke to
my butt:
Butt, oh butt. Such a sweet butt. You always loved me, and I showed you so
little love. I’m so sorry, really. Oh butt, my beautiful bottom. I want you to be
exactly as you are. Big, round, jiggly, hairy – everything. You are one of my best
companions. I practically sit on you so many hours of the day. So happy you are
so cushie and comfy! Really, you are just the perfect size.
I’m sorry for not appreciating you and wanting for you to change for all these
years. I love your presence, the statement you make. Seriously, you kick-ass
(haha). You are a work of arse! (OK, I’ll stop). I’m sorry for making you the butt
of my jokes…
I love you butt, please keep being as you are, I love every little hair on you,
how you move and jiggle, how you help me relieve myself of poop so
graciously. You rock. I love you.
OK, I hope this wasn’t too much TMI, but I wanted to make the point clear:
each and every part of your body deserves your appreciation.
When you appreciate your body, you may find that your body is actually
answering to you. At least for me. My eyebrows said about the tweezers: “Yeah,
it hurt you mother-f****r!”
Even the hair on my shoulder (yeah, I got that one going in my late twenties.
“Recent edition!”) – even the hair there told me, “why do you think we popped
here? We are like epaulette of honor, and you have mistreated us! Wear us like a
badge of honor, you are a true man now!”
So if your body speaks to you, let it speak. And respond.
If you feel uncomfortable, that’s good. That’s the way. I promise you that if
you’ll do this exercise every three months or so, your self esteem will change
dramatically.
I don’t care how much you weigh. You can appreciate yourself. I recently
finished reading Whitney Thore’s “I Do It with the Lights On: And 10 More
Discoveries on the Road to a Blissfully Shame-Free Life.” It was great to read
how a person weighing 378 lb. (171 kg) can be so confident and love herself. It
was inspiring for me too, personally, and made me determined to love myself
even more.
I don’t care how physically disabled you are. You are perfect as you are. Even
if your legs are weak, even if you are ‘deformed’ in some way. There’s no such
thing as being ‘deformed’. Only ‘beautifully formed.’ Nick Vujicic, that amazing
no-arms and no-legs dude, says “I don’t believe I’m disabled. Yes, I have no
arms and no legs but big deal. Doesn’t matter how I look. It’s who I am and what
I do.”
Be inspired. Love yourself as you are. Show love to your body. Please, show
love to your body. Your body deserves it. It longs for it. And you are the only
person that can give it the appreciation it craves for.

power you believe in, they brought us to

TAKE EXTREME MEASURES
You have to do whatever it takes to imprint on your mind that you love yourself.
I’ve taken some extreme measures to do so. I want to share some of these with
you. Hopefully you’ll be a little extreme too!
But first, though it sounds silly, let’s think for a moment on WHY. We’ve
been talking all throughout this book on HOW. But why should we love
ourselves? Why should I have taken extreme measures to convince my mind that
I DO love myself?
Well, I think it’s simple, and no need to make it complicated: when we love
ourselves we get to do more, have more, and be more. Think of two people
going to a casino. One person has only four tokens, those small discs used in lieu
of currency in casinos. The other person has 400 tokens.
Who is going to have more chances to win? Who is going to do more playing
and having more fun? And who is going to be ultimately happier?
Now, there is no straight answer. And sure we can say that there are some
benefits to having only four tokens. But generally, personally, if I had to choose,
I’d choose the latter – 400 tokens please!
Just to get it out of the way – I’m not into casinos or gambling, in fact I pretty
much oppose the whole thing.
But it’s a great metaphor.
I think that SELF-LOVE is the token we play with in the casino called LIFE.
The more self love we have, the more ability we have to dare, play more, have
more fun, do more, and ultimately become more.
Self-love to me feels like a cushion. It helps us fall unto something soft
whenever we do fall. And we fall ALL the time. Falling may be negative
criticism. If we have enough of a ‘cushion’, enough of self-love, it wouldn’t hurt
as much.
There’s this great quote by American author Elbert Hubbard: “To avoid
criticism, do nothing, say nothing, and be nothing.”
I like it. It’s powerful.
In life we simply CAN’T avoid criticism. Especially when we want to do
SOMEthing, say SOMEthing, and be SOMEone. When we want to claim our
share in the universe, we WILL face criticism. And the only way I found to deal
with criticism is to have a pretty cushie and comfy and feathery cushion of self
love to fall on.
So this is what we do in this book: we increase our numbers of tokens, we add
feathers (synthetic if you wish!) to our cushions.
If someone asks you why you liked this book, you can tell it explained you a
lot about casino tokens and cushion feathers. ;)
Alright, now to the real deal. Here are some of the things I’ve done to increase
my amount of self-love tokens, and add to my cushion of love to myself.
I wrote a long letter to myself explaining to me why I love myself. Why I’m
sorry for being mean to myself some times. And why I am committed to love
myself more and more.
I wrote a love poem to myself. Yeah.
I took as many photos of my childhood as I could find and hung them
EVERYWHERE. The reason: I think children should receive love. Every child.
Should adults…? Well, whenever I’m cynical or negative, I am not sure adult
should all receive love. Therefore, whenever I bump into a picture of myself, age
three, five, seven, I feel positive emotions toward that boy. And that makes me
feel better. I want the best for him, meaning that I want the best for me.
Now, why do I say that I have taken things to extreme measure? Cause my
office, aka my ‘man cave’, has pictures from floor to ceiling. I don’t host anyone
in my office; Hallel actually canot enter without my consent. Yep, I’m crazy. But
I think Virginia Wolf was right when she had demanded an author should have
“a room of one’s own.”
Basically I have my own floor, at the bottom of the house, for which I pay
rent separately from my lovely income from my books and my art – and this
place is my studio, my office, my heaven. And the pictures constantly remind me
that I am loved, and that I’m worthy of love.
What else do I have in this shrine of mine to which NO friend has entered?
Well, basically, anything that makes me feel proud. Here, I’ll look around and
I’ll tell you: here’s a certificate from age 13 of me graduating a one week course
in surfing, and winning the third place at a competition in the end.
The reason I put it up is that in the beginning of that week I was the lousiest
of all the 15 kids who were there. Through practice and perseverance I managed
to slowly improve, and by the last day the kids who were not even considering
me as ‘competition’, began rethinking!
It reminds me that I am capable of anything I put my mind to.
Then there are many photos on the wall, childhood, romantic relationships
that helped me grow, friends from high school, from college (only those that I
felt loved me and appreciated me).
Here’s a badge that I put on my shirt, saying “Jonathan – Supervisor.” I had
this grand art project in Africa, where I had to oversee four workers. We made a
huge floor mosaic, sculptors, etc. And I had the most awful boss who oversaw
the whole project, and gave me a really hard time.
I called Hallel several times from Africa and cried and cried over the phone.
But eventually we finished the project, after less than four weeks. And I got the
MONEY and it was GOOD. And this “Supervisor” badge reminds me that I can
survive the most adverse circumstances, with this hateful boss who probably
didn’t get laid for too long.
Moving along the wall I see a greeting card I like from my friend Holly:
“Jonathan – thank you for being such a central part of my journey this year. I
love you! Holly”.
I like this card because it makes me feel that I am loved.
Do you get the point? I hang diplomas, certificates, letters, cards, grade
sheets, sketches, old calendar pictures that I like, even ATM slips that indicated
that I just deposited a fat check. I have the tickets indicating I went to a Joel
Osteen “Night of Hope” event (so proud of myself to have gone!) and the
pamphlet of a Jack Canfield full year course for trainers (which I attended and
graduated OMG!), and my most precious things, or at least some of the most
precious things are little notes from Hallel, may it be for my birthday, or just a
quick note she scribbled: “Jon love, you are so amazing for having done the
dishes! Thanks and a kiss!”
Now, what if you don’t have the ability to allow yourself the privacy of your
own ‘man-cave’ or ‘a room of one’s own’ or that you are just embarrassed to
actually take that space for you and you only? This is what I’ve done for the
years BEFORE I got my office-cave. (All this and more – in the next chapter!)

love; it is your deserved respite for
recharging your batteries.”

CAPTURING YOUR SUCCESSES
Basically, to continue the last chapter, we are all for enlarging our amounts of
tokens, or of cushion feathers.
Long before I had my man-cave I created a power-point presentation with my
successes. Now, you don’t have to be tech-savvy or anything. When smartphones came out, I basically did much of it using the phone.
So, what is it exactly.
It’s a folder or a power point presentation, in which you put all your photos or
other things (soon to be explained) of things that make you feel good,
accomplished, celebrated, loved.
In the power-point presentation I simply took photos of my old photos from
my childhood (no need to scan or overdue it. Phone photos are FINE!). I added
photos from recent time that I liked.
I also added few photos of landscapes that brought me a feeling of ease. The
talented photographer for all these photos is called Images. His given name is
Google. Look for him. He’s pretty versatile. He also got his own website,
images.google.com. He has taken millions of photos; I don’t know how he does
that. Anyway, as long as it’s for your own use, Mr. Google is happy for you to
take any photo and… Voilà!
The reason I’m being slightly whimsical here is that we all have such amazing
photos handy. And they let our soul loose and our heart sing. And if you put
them in your own phone folder, and look at them often, you FEEL better.
Apart from my own photos and photos of landscapes, babies and other things
that make me feel good, I began to DOCUMENT my successes.
For example, my friend Chaya saw a painting of mine in a home in Germany.
She hurried to take a photo and to tell me: “One day I wanna have one of your
works too!”
Now, instead of letting this moment of small victory vanish into the abyss of
my email archive, I snapped a photo of my screen.
You can do it on your computer (search for the printscreen key on your
keyboard), on your phone either press and hold the power and volume down
buttons at the same time until your screen flashes (for androids) or press
simultaneously the home button and the Power-off-on button located on the
opposite edge of the phone.
Do it now, so that you know you can do it.
Now, all your screenshots will find their way into a screenshot folder. It’s as
easy as that.
Here’s what I have in my screenshots folder on my phone: an inspirational
quote by Nick Vujicic I saw and wanted to remember (by now you understand
I’m a quote-addict right?); my sister’s photo of a painting of mine in a gallery in
Tel Aviv; a photo of my two nieces (they are adorable, really); a photo of my
hard-working friend abroad with his wife smiling (I convinced him to go!); a
Facebook message from my friend Judy saying I’m such an encourager and
motivator, saying that “through your prayers and friendship I am motivated to be
a better person” (aw shucks!); an e-mail from my Canadian friend Khursheed
saying about one of my videos “Jonathan darling this is fucking amazing! Sorry
there are no other words to describe it, I’m so impressed darling”; a Direct
Message I got on Twitter from @jmmoore_62 “I am glued to your writings. I’m
learning a lot!”, etc. etc.
Now, why is this important? Why am I taking your precious time, and
precious trees of this earth to spend yet another paper? Well, because this is
CRUCIAL.
You wanna have great successes in life? Begin by celebrating the tiny
successes. Even before I had friends taking photos of my art abroad, or before I
even had a Twitter account, I understood that there are moments in life you
MUST remember.
I have this friend, who texted me once after a long talk on the phone, “Jon,
thanks for listening. You’re a real friend.”
I screen-captured it. It’s important. When I feel down, to scroll through the
photos in my screenshot folder, and see, “Jon, thanks for listening. You’re a real
friend”… - that’s powerful. It makes me VALUE myself better, you see? Or
sometimes my self esteem is low, and I think I’m writing to myself and that NO
ONE will EVER read this BS cause it SUCKS. Yeah.
Then to see the Twitter message of my friend June saying she’s “glued” to my
writing. Man, that feels good.
I want you to truly celebrate your successes. Someone left you a note, a kind
note, in the office? Take a photo of it, then take a screenshot so it finds its way to
your screenshot folder. Then it’s there. And while I clean my phone often, I
never clean my screenshot folder. It’s there for me.
You celebrated your friend’s birthday and you like the photo of you?
Screenshot. You went through your old files and saw something from years ago
that made you feel “aww…” – Screenshot! You invested in buying yourself new
shoes, and enjoyed the feeling of treating yourself as you looked at your feet –
Screenshot!
How often should you look at your screenshot folder or PowerPoint
presentation? As often as you can.
I look at my photos once a day, in the morning. Sometimes when I wash the
dishes I even put the photos as a slideshow. Yeah, you can do it on your phone
too. The bottom line is that you want to inundate your brain with your successes.
Anyhow, without your effort, it will be inundated with crap and news and
negativity. Your conscious effort to feed your mind positive images related to
yourself, your successes, and your wellbeing – will pay back.
I promise.
And with time, you will FEEL better. You will walk into the casino of life
with more tokens than before. And if you receive any nasty criticism, your
cushion of self-love and self-esteem will comfort you when you get bumped and
fall down.
You may think – yeah, but it’s complicated, and too… technical for me. Well,
you can do it hands-on, with a journal. Have a journal for your successes and
triumph – only for those. And set it close to you and read through it often. It can
have pretty awesome results.
Do it. Invest in yourself. Make your folder thick. Make your PowerPoint
presentation heavy. Make your journal full. Make your love to yourself express
itself physically in this world.

THE THREE ENEMIES INSIDE Let’s take a short break from all the
technical how-to’s and to-do’s and “another good idea is…” and let’s speak now
of the worst enemy we all have.
You noticed by now, I’m a fairly positive person. I rarely focus intentionally
on the negative stuff. But now I’m going to go off the path of goodie-goodies
and talk about the dark trees off of the path.
I love trees. But these are DARK trees.
In them, there are DARK creatures. Creatures that if they GET YOU, you
become their prey, you are devoured by them. They will eat each and every part
of you, and leave nothing good.
Who are these dark forces, and who is their king?
These dark forces are self-loathing, self-hatred and self-criticism.
They are all PART of YOU.
They look like you, they behave like you. But you MUST remember that
these are dark forces that will EAT YOU ALIVE.
Self-loathing says: “I don’t like that you do this. You ALWAYS do this! You are
soooo stupid!”
Self-loathing awaits your failure, big or small. Right around the corner it jumps
at you, and says, with a smile, “you suck! You disgust me!”
Self-loathing forces seem fair and OK, but you should watch for them. They are
the ones that make you look at a photo and say, “you look ugly here!”
Yet self-loathing is nothing like Self-hatred. Oh no. Self-hatred makes Selfloathing look like an angle. Self-hatred is blatant. Self-hatred will wait for you,
be really quiet, and just when you are really close, shout in your ear: “I HATE
you!”
Self-hatred is more in-your-face than their friend Self-loathing. The forces called
Self-hatred will look for your worst moment. You see them less than Selfloathing, but boy, when they come, you need to BEWARE. They can choke your
soul to death. Run away from them when you smell them.
Unlike these two, the Self-criticism seems less appalling. Wearing an intellectual
disguise, they will try and sound so matter-of-factly and so knowledgeable, that
if you forget who you are talking with, you will easily fall into their trap. They
are the forces that tell you, “but you screwed up last time.” The Self-criticism
forces tell you in a whisper, rather than in shouting: “but you know that you are
not GOOD enough” and they whisper “you don’t deserve THAT!”
Self-criticism will come at your moments of success. They won’t come when
you are down, oh no, why should they? They’ll leave the work for two dumber
ones, those Self-loathing and Self-hatred. Oh no. Self-criticism will see
themselves as invited to your celebrations. They will come to the front of your
mind, at the vortex of your perception and say: “but this person doesn’t REALLY
love you. Wait till you need them, then you’ll see.” They will hiss things like,
“Oh, that speech of yours was a little inadequate. No worries. You can screw up
next time.”
The Self-criticism forces are smart, and you should watch for them. But they too,
like the two other forces, work for the King of all forces. The dark king. The one
with the mask.

thirties, and for almost a decade I
spiraled down into paranoia, rage, selfloathing, and thoughts of suicide.”

THE INNER-ENEMY
WITH THE MASK
No one is stronger or mightier than the King of all the inner dark forces.
He is the invisible King. You don’t see him. He wears a mask that makes him
seem like your best friend. Like an advisor. Like a true benefactor.
But don’t be mistaken. The King knows very well what it does. Whereas his
three subordinates come at moments of exercise, when it is time for them to
come, the King, without you knowing, is ever-near you. This is what made him
the King. He feeds on your soul more than the other three ever dream. Selfloathing is a baby next to the King. Self-hatred is an armature. Self-criticism is
an ignorant deputy.
Don’t worry, I’ll reveal his face to you in a moment. Not that you will believe
me. This is what the King of the dark forces is an expert in: making you think
he’s no biggie. He will tell you: “Oh, what he says is bullshit, no?”
The King of all your inner dark forces is not fear. It’s not rage and it’s not
depression. These are important forces, but they don’t strike as often and as
severely as the King.
The King has his ways. He has his mask, so that you will NEVER recognize
him. Take his mask off, and he vanishes. But he’ll come back immediately with
a new mask.
The King is Self-doubt.
Self-doubt?
How is Self-doubt stronger than Self-loathing, or Self-Hatred, or Selfcriticism? How is he mightier than paranoia, fear, depression, rage, anger…?
Oh, he is.
Don’t worry. You might be under his effects right now.
King Self-doubt has taught few things to the other forces, especially to Selfcriticism. Self-criticism often knows how to sound like King Self-doubt. Selfcriticism also employs a tone of speech that seems at time harmless. Selfcriticism learnt from the King that in order to be constantly invited and never
hushed away they must sound intelligent, wise, concerned for YOUR wellbeing.
But still, Self-criticism is only the deputy. Self-criticism does not have the
power that the King exercises over you. It’s the King that rules the Kingdom of
dark forces, always wishing to expand it to every good soil in your everexpanding soul.
The King has learnt the way through the guards. While often Self-criticism is
thrown away through the gates of your mind’s castle, the King knows how to
remain always invited.
The King doesn’t SEEM dark at all. The King is there FOR you, or so it
seems.
The king also doesn’t use such ignorant phrases such as the deputy, Selfcriticism. While the latter may say, “You screwed up! You always do it!” the
King will NEVER use such language.
Instead, the King speaks in soft-spoken words. His sentences are short. His
tone always finishes with a question. The King of the dark forces tries to win
your heart and take the place of your honored advisor, your Intuition.
The King has learnt to speak and sound like your Intuition. He has learnt that
she speaks in short sentences, sometimes even without words. And so the King
constantly tries to do the same.
Whereas Intuition tells you, “I feel you can do it!” the King only says,
“Mmmm…. Can you?”
Whereas Intuition tells you, “It will help you shine” the King says
“Hopefully… it will be unfortunate if it won’t, won’t it?”
The King likes you not to affiliate him with those other dark forces, his
subordinates. He would like to be ever present in your castle. To ever advise you.
All that you have done in your life that was well, was because you DIDN’T
listen to the King, to Self-doubt himself.
All that you have done in your life that did NOT go well, was because you
DID listen to the King, to Self-doubt in all his glory.
Do I really need to give you examples? The relationships that didn’t work?
Intuition told you, “No, I don’t have a good feeling.” But Self-doubt asked,
“Why, do you really think we may find someone better than that?”
In your health and fitness, in your career, in your free time, in your finances,
in ALL of your relationships, the King, Self-doubt, always struggles to
undermine your efforts. He tries to sway you off from the path that is GOOD for
you. He feeds on your energy going to HIM and to his Kingdom. He feeds on
your giving energy to Self-loathing, to Self-hatred and to Self-criticism.
By exercising his well-crafted speech, his ever-gentle questions, his dance
with uncertainty, his qualms of hesitation, the joy of having you stuck in
indecision though you KNOW the right thing to do…
The King’s powers are MIGHT. You don’t even know when he’s around,
when he’s speaking, when his dark energy begins to wrap your mind. You don’t
even need to go off the castle and wonder around the dark forest. You can remain
well seated in your chamber, and Self-doubt, the King, disguised by true concern
and love and care – will strike you ever so gently with dubiousness, suspicion,
confusion – all to bring your mind to HIS Kingdom. Where he can FEED off of
you.
When you have listened to more than one sentence of him, you are falling fast
down the path of darkness. Your eyes blare, your mouth slows down. Even the
voices of your dear Intuition drown by the King’s loving embrace. “Oh will it?
Perhaps we shall wait? Perhaps this is asking for too much? Perhaps? Possibly?
maybe?”
Then you find yourself in a trance. It started by a simple question, seemingly
well intended, caring one. But then you hesitated, didn’t know what to answer,
and the king hurried to tell you, “Well if I remember correctly, last time you
chose to do THAT, well, do I remember right? Was it not rather unsuccessful?”
Then the more you listen to the King the more the voice of Intuition drowns
and disappears. You don’t even hear her nor feel her hand grabbing you, and you
are led down the staircase by the smiling King, who whispers, “You shouldn’t,
should you? You don’t know, don’t you? You don’t want to, don’t you?”
And with each question you find yourself closer to the gates, leaving your
beloved castle. You don’t hear Intuition’s whispers, her voice long gone, and the
sound of your protective horses in their stables, their screaming and shouting for
you not to leave, doesn’t even register in your mind. And then you are out there,
in the trail, when you hear Self-criticism joining behind you, saying: “But you
always mess up that way anyway” and you see the wretched Self-loathing saying
“here comes the stupid one again, thinking that this time it’s different, ha-ha!”
and Self-hatred, “Why do you think you can even THINK of it as a possibility?!
You pitiful, pathetic, sorry you!”
And before long you are devoured, in the middle of the dark forest, by the
dark forces having a feast. Your energy is drained, your whole being is
consumed by the dark forces.
To the outside world you can’t explain what had happened. But you are tired,
exhausted, depleted, emptied of all good.
And it’s so weird, because you were actually optimistic.
To the outside world, to those who care about you, you can’t even explain
what happened. Truth is, that even to yourself you lack the words. You ask
yourself indeed, “What happened?”
Little do you know that it was Self-doubt that seduced you, that took you out
of your castle. Little do you know that you fell, yet again, to his seducing
powers. Little do you know how he operated, how he sounded totally innocent.
Little do you know what had happened to you.
All you want is OUT, to go to sleep, to drown yourself in food, in shopping,
in porn, in drugs, in other outer expression of the inner feast taking place within
you: the dark feast in which Self-loathing, Self-hatred, and Self-criticism feed on
your soul, with the sad look of their King.
But there is a way out.

WINNING AND OVERCOMING SELF-DOUBT
OK, I think it’s time for us to get clearer about how to win King Self-doubt.
Then we can move on with our book. I don’t want to give Self-doubt and his
dark forces too much space in this book. But I do sense that this part is needed.
So let’s do it, and move on, shall we?
King Self-doubt cannot be killed. That’s the first thing we need to understand.
If you are saying “Kill the damned bastard!” you are not in the right direction.
Why not? Because you are emitting energy to him. He’s getting your
attention. He can then said, “Wow, you seem unhinged, don’t you? It’s not like
you might think there’s some truth in my words, right?”
And then you begin falling into his trap. He is smarter than you. Should I
repeat this? He is smarter than you. He has access to your memory faster than
your consciousness. He will prove you wrong, prove himself right, and do it all
without much effort.
In fact, let’s stress again the fact that he IS responsible for much of the
unhappiness in your life. He IS your arch-enemy. And he CANNOT be killed,
nor convinced, nor won over by plausible explanations.
Anything you SAY to him, any attempt to CONVERSE with him maturely,
will give him the court advantage to blind you, impair your hearing, and put you
to a trance in which HE is the leader and not you.
He is only WAITING for you to begin responding to him. That’s what you’ve
been doing. You’ve tried all of the methods you know in your adult life.
The only problem is that the King is PART of you. He knows ALL your
arguments. He has been with you and watched EVERYTHING. And so, like in a
worst nightmare, he can attack you again and again, and you WILL not win.
Am I making the point clear? The King, Self-doubt himself, WANTS you to
respond to him. And you must NEVER do it.
NEVER respond to him.
The way to overcome the King is to first understand him.
In fact, though he is the King of the dark forces, it’s worth understanding his
story.
I once had a dog – it was a sweet dog, which was owned by my girlfriend
Rebecca. When we moved in together she brought her dog with her. Let’s call
him Genius.
Genius was a bichon frise dog, white, fluffy, chubby, the most adorable you
can find.
Genius, however, had some difficulties.
He had skin soars, and to relieve his pain, he would chew on his skin soars. It
would begin in licking. Seemingly, the licking was fine, as it was a natural thing
to do. Then, Genius would continue to nibbling. The nibbling would release him
of some of the pain, and would then lead to munching.
By then we’d say, “Genius!” and he’d look up, understand that he had done
something wrong, and lay his head down.
Two minutes later he’d begin licking again. Then nibbling, munching, and
actual guzzling on his own skin. If we are in the other room or so, he’d keep
eating until he’d hit some actual nerve or the bone or something (oh it hurts for
me to write about it!), and then he’d yelp the most painful yelp you ever heard.
Poor Genius.
We tried everything. We tried creams, oils, putting medical gauze on his leg
(he’d move it), wrapping his legs with various materials. Nothing helped.
When the veterinarian said, “It’s getting worse,” looking at the shiny red areas
devoured on Genius’ legs, we said, “We know!”
The veterinarian then said we’ll have to use an Elizabethan collar around his
neck, this plastic cone thing to prevent him from licking himself.
In the following days poor Genius was moaning and groaning, as if we at least
castrated him. His look was pitiful, he tried again and again to reach his legs, and
we’d see the plastic cone banging all over.
Genius’ look, whenever he looked at us, was resentful. His eyebrows were
tight and he seemed disapproving of our behavior and of how we DARED to put
the cone around him.
Oh how he liked when we took it off for him to eat actual FOOD rather than
his own body. Then we’d run after him with the cone, and he’d run as fast as he
could as if his life depended on it (which, no insult, wasn’t too fast for our
chubby Genius).
But week by week, the wounds began to heal, until eventually they healed
completely.
We then took the cone off, and Genius was really happy.
But we kept the cone. And every time Genius began developing the beginning
of such a wound, we’d immediately return the cone for few days.
So, how is Genius related to our Self-doubt, to that mighty and frightening
King?
The truth is that there is more similarity than we may guess.
Genius didn’t want to lead to his wounds growing worst. All he wanted was to
lick them, in a way, to relieve the pain.
Similarly, King Self-doubt, as awful as he may have sounded, doesn’t want, in
his heart, for your inner wounds to grow worst. All he wants is to protect you, in
a way, to relieve your future pain. To protect you from reliving the awful pain
you have already experienced in the past.
Genius, though his name says otherwise, wasn’t the smartest of creatures. Had
he known that his licking would cause him more harm, would have refrained
from it. But he was instead moved to agonizing self-inflicted terror, just because
his brain couldn’t comprehend the connection between licking, which seems to
relieve the pain, and between his deepening wounds.
This is getting more and more profound. Do you bear with me? Go to pee or
grab some bite to eat, I want you focused when you read this.
Similarly to Genius, the King, Self-doubt, doesn’t KNOW that through
voicing his legitimate concerns, he is going to inflict more pain on him. He
doesn’t know that doubt will lead to the wrong actions, which will create future
suffering.
For example, though you really WANT to do something, you instead let the
King to convince you that you really SHOULDN’T. Instead you choose to do
something you don’t REALLY want. In turn, the fact you don’t REALLY want
it, leads to a low commitment, low participation on your side. This, of course,
lead to failure, or, in the best scenario, to mediocre results.
The King then tells you, “remember that failure?” or “Those results were
pretty mediocre, weren’t they?” and his mere words lead you to be led by him,
further and further down the spiraling staircase, led by Self-doubt, until you find
yourself in the dark forest again.
What’s so unique is that King Self-doubt does not really LIKE to be in the
forest.
Seriously.
King Self-doubt is a more intelligent creature than his three forces. This is
why he is the King, and they are his subordinates.
The King prefers the coziness of the Castle, being in the comfortable
grandeur, than being in the cold forest seeing the stupid dark forces devour you
and your energy.
When Genius used to yelp, after eating his skin out and creating the most
frightening bright red sour, his face would seem so… sad. He really looked sad. I
felt pity for him.
Yes. I know you understood. There, in the feast of the dark forces, out there in
the dark forest, the King actually looks sad.
He’d prefer going back to the warm and cozy Castle.
There, in the woods, he is waiting for you to jump up and kick the three forces
in the balls. Eventually you always do it.
Eventually you ALWAYS get up. It’s your nature. Much like it’s the nature of
the King to lead you down the staircase and into the forest.
But WHY does the King do it? Why does he do it, if he LIKES to remain in
the Castle?
You need to understand that whenever the King receives your ENERGY, he
CANNOT do ANYTHING BUT put you in a trance, and lead you down the
staircase. He doesn’t have any other option. That’s HIS nature.
Much like Genius doesn’t have any other option than to munch on his wounds
though it’s not good for him, so cannot the King do anything else but lead you
down, though it’s not good for him either.
Let’s move on. How do we therefore overcome the King?
First of all, now we have more empathy to the King. And that’s good. It
makes us realize that he has a role. He does.
There’s a reason why the King can get into the Castle, and why his dark
subordinates can’t. The King was actually invited there early on. You NEEDED
him. His words often protected you. Remember?
Remember when you were a kid, the King saved you from some stupid stuff.
That’s when your Intuition was still developing.
Over the years Intuition developed beautifully. It’s true that she speaks
quietly, that her words are reticent, that sometimes you can get frustrated and
say, “But I can’t hear you!”
But Intuition cannot raise her voice. He nature is a delicate one. It’s YOU that
needs to silence the noise, so that you can LISTEN to her.
But more often than not you listen to the King. The King is a smart being.
He’s dumb because he doesn’t know better than to kick himself –and you – out
of the castle. But he is also smart because he learnt that there are many ways of
speech to which you will NOT listen.
The King, Self-doubt, learnt that if he employs the speech of Self-criticism,
Self-hatred and Self-loathing, you spot him in a second. You yell: “Stop it, Selfdoubt!”
And aw, does that hurt the King or what. He thinks to himself, “But I’m a
King. How can you SPEAK to ME that way?!?! And it was YOU who invited
ME here in the first place!”
Then the King agonizes. All he wants is your attention and love. He does
NOT want to be yelled at. He wants to stay in your castle, and for you to be
really nice to him, invite him everywhere, feed him and nurture him. He DID
serve you well many times. Your treatment of being ungrateful to him is indeed a
wrongdoing on your part. Don’t be ungrateful for those who helped you.
When you yell at him, when you kick him in the butt, that’s when the King
goes off to the corner, and begins rubbing his hands in one another. That’s when
his dark nature comes through. That’s when he thinks of HOW to get your
energy. He thinks of the BEST ways to get to you.
He did it before, and he will ALWAYS do it. Much like Intuition NEVER
raises her voice and always speaks quietly, Self-doubt ALWAYS comes back
with a better mask, to win you over again. It’s HIS nature.
Which kinds of masks does the King have? Oh, wow, it would take me a
whole book (not like this one, a BIG one), to even begin describing all his
masks.
Sometimes he wears the mask of a caring mother. Or a caring father.
Sometimes he wears the mask of an older lady, or a teacher. Sometimes he wears
the mask of a baby, or a child. Sometimes his mask is the rational and slightlyremote professor, saying, “I do doubt that this will work, but I may be wrong,
even though I have never been wrong, not that I remember.” Yet other times he
wears the cheerleader’s mask: “You can do it! You can do it! Just watch out not
to get hurt, you do remember what happened last time, right?” Other times he
wears the doctor’s mask: “I do think it’s better to rest, wouldn’t you?” and
sometimes the partier’s mask: “Oh, you can have so much fun here, it means you
are a fun person! Going away would mean missing on all the good stuff, and you
don’t want to miss all the GOOD stuff, right?”
There are thousands and thousands, if not millions of masks that the King can
employ and create in a second. Yet, my favorite mask is the mask of no other
than…
“I don’t have a good feeling about it, do you?”
You hear this gentle voice and you become alarmed. “Intuition?”
“I just don’t know about this, you know?”
“Intuition? Is that YOU?”
“I would tell you if I had a good feeling, but I don’t. But it’s totally up to you,
is it not?”
“Well, yes. But I want to hear your opinion, Intuition,” you say.
“I think this might not be the best thing,” you hear the whispering voice, “I
really care for you, and I just don’t have a good… hunch for that, do you?”
“I…” you say, “I…—”
“Why don’t you just wait and see? No need to rush, right?”
“I… guess…” you say, and you don’t even notice how your drowsy mind
begins to speak slower and slower.
The rest is already clear.
Only later, in the woods, drained of energy and passion, emptied of hope and
joy, there, do you realize what had happened.
“Self-doubt!” you shout, and look at the saddened King.
You kick off the three dark forces, which have brought their giant friends
Paranoia and Depression over.
Everyone runs to the woods in fear. They see that you have HAD IT.
You look with anger at Self-doubt. You brush your clothes off, and walk back
to the Castle.
Self-doubt, behind you, walks with his head bowed down.
Frustrated, you walk back through the gates. You nod to the disappointed
horses, who bow their heads down. You climb up your magnificent Castle. You
don’t even remember going down this spiraling staircase.
Then you see Intuition, smiling, ever-calm, ever-loving.
“But,” you say, “why didn’t you SAY anything?”
She whispers, with a gentle smile, “I did.”

intuition.”

INTUITION
She is the most precious guest in your Castle. And you need to listen to her. She
will direct you and guide you. She is your best source of intelligence.
For years we lived on the notion there is ONE intelligence. This was measure
by Intelligence Quotient (IQ). Then we learnt that finding the IQ level of a
person does not help solve many of our riddles, such as why some people are
more financially successful than others, even though they have a lower IQ?
Then came Emotional Intelligence. Though the term first appeared in the
1960s, it took several more decades to be developed into something we all can
speak without people bursting in laughter (like they did in the 1990s).
In the future, we will see another form of Intelligence receiving more and
more attention. That is: Intuitive Intelligence. This is a form of intelligence that
cannot be tracked by our old ways of measuring.
But it is true and strong, and the following years will show it as REAL.
Currently, at the time of the writing of this book, the term Emotional
Intelligence brings some 8 million results on Google. At the same time, the term
Intuitive Intelligence brings only 400 thousand results. The term Intuitive
Intelligence doesn’t even have, as of now, its own Wikipedia article, while
Emotional Intelligence has an exhaustive article, with over 100 references.
We live in an era in which the power of intuition slowly emerges in front of
our eyes. Wait and see.
To come back to our allegory about your mind, about Intuition and King Selfdoubt, your goal is to constantly quiet down King Self-doubt, and to listen to
what Intuition whispers.
That is easier said than done. As we saw, the King can often SEEM, TALK
and ACT as if he is Intuition herself.
But don’t be fooled. He is easily discoverable.
If you ask your Intuition: “Is it you that speak, my Intuition?” she answers, “I
am her.”
If you ask your King, wearing one of his many masks, “Is it you that speak,
my Intuition?” his answers ALWAYS end up with a question. He may say: “Why
are you asking? Let’s focus on the decision at hand, and the decision does seem
to me quite irrational, is it not?”
Or, when you ask, “Is it you, my Intuition?” you may hear the King trying to
whisper:
“I am your bloody Intuition, I talk like her, I act like her, I even freakin’
whisper, why would you NOT think it is ME?”
Soon you’ll see that it is not your Intuition speaking.
The King can be EASILY exposed, as long as YOU remember to ask
QUESTIONS.
By that you are using HIS sword, HIS drug, HIS trick.
“Is this YOU, my King Self-Doubt?”
“Why, why should you think it was me? And if it was me? Should you not
focus instead on WHAT I’m saying rather than clinging to WHO said that? Does
that seem smart? That’s only another proof that you currently do NOT posses the
ability to decide, is it not?”
Instead of answering to the King’s questions, keep asking him, “Is this you,
sweet King Self-doubt?”
“Well why is all this insistence on WHO is here rather than on WHAT I’m
screaming? Is this not mere stupidity?”
The distinction can be made easily. Self-doubt feels attacked when he is
confronted. Self-doubt only wants you to respond and fall into HIS trap. By
asking him your OWN QUESTION you can easily see how his mask falls off.
Now, instead of exposing him and then throwing him up the window, and then
having him enter the chamber again as one of the servants, as Intuition, dressed
as a baby, or as a poor peasant – instead of you triggering him to start figuring
his next move, just do the following. This can CHANGE your life, as long as
you remember to do it: “Oh sweet King, most loyal King, thank you so much for
your input. You are SOOO valuable, and SOOO sweet and loyal…”
Now you will notice his mask-less face showing a hopeful look.
“Come,” you say to him, “come and sit on me, near me, I want you up close.”
Now he comes, ashamed but willing.
If you want to be really smart, tell him, “I was just about to listen to Intuition,
would you like to join me while I caress your head?”
Then you’ll see the King nodding his head gently. Caress him. Love him.
Embrace him.
Your King is good. His intentions are good. Yet he is unintelligent. He cannot
develop the abilities that Intuition has. He cannot see clearly that the path in
which you give HIM energy leads you BOTH out of the castle and into the dark
forces hands.
So LOVE your King. Embrace Self-doubt. Spend time together doing what
YOU love. Whenever he begins asking his doubtful questions about your
abilities, about what you deserve and what you don’t, about how awful it may be
if you trust and then you get hurt… - whenever he does that, ask him: “Oh, is it
you, sweet Self-doubt?”
And then, without waiting for an answer, invite him closer again, “Come,
love, sit here with me,” and notice how he gets silence.
You may ask, “But, shouldn’t I LISTEN to him sometimes? Doesn’t his voice
represent REASON or CAUTION?”
The answer here is clear. NO.
Reason or caution are parts of your Intuition’s abilities. If you delegate to her
all of the responsibilities that you supposedly give Self-doubt, you will soon hear
her say things that will sound very much like Self-doubt, with a similar wording,
but with a different source.
“I wouldn’t hurry,” you may hear her say, “I would wait and see how
committed THEY are first.”
Or you may hear her saying, “I don’t want to go there. I don’t want to go
there.”
If you develop and train your ear to listen well to her voice, you may hear that
some sentences actually end up with an exclamation mark. “I don’t want to go
there!”
But you will never hear her giving you a question mark at the end. It’s NOT in
her NATURE.
Intuition is ever-knowing. If she doesn’t know, she’ll tell you, “I don’t know
right now. Let’s sleep on it. I need to connect and gather more information.”
But she will NEVER consult with you, or with any other HUMAN being.
Your intuition is connected to Source, she is connected to God, connected all that
has been, all that is, and to all that will ever be. She is connected to the shared
intelligence of all humanity, of all reality.
Don’t underestimate her. Underestimating her leads to suffering, to constant
erring, to misfortune and to unhappiness. Adopting her, caressing her, listening
to her, embracing her, taking care of her, nurturing her, being there for her,
quieting it all for her, dedicating time to her, SEEING her – that’s what you are
now asked to do.

DUMPING GRATITUDE Look, this subject has been hashed and rehashed
over and over again. But I cannot leave without including it. This “subject” is
Gratitude.
Now, there’s a reason why I didn’t title this chapter “Gratitude”. With so
many books, articles and mentions, we’ve become immune to the word and to its
powers.
Similarly, with quite the opposite, the word “Terror” used to evoke real fear
and actual terror within us. But with this word being on the news ALL the time,
it slowly lost much of its inner weight and emotions attached. Not that we aren’t
afraid, we are, but we are not ‘terrorized’ as we were before by this word.
Similarly, the word “Gratitude” has lost somewhat from its weight. “Gratitude
feels almost like a Hallmark card, like a quote you’ll bump into, like yet another
book in the Self-help section.
And nevertheless, like the word LOVE, even though it has been used so many
times, it still holds GREAT powers.
Really GREAT.
So, allow me to try and re-structure this word in your head, will you? This
will enable you to see this word in a fresh way, which might then drive you to
actually enjoy the HUGE benefits this word carries with it.
The word Gratitude comes from the Latin root grat, meaning pleasing or
thanking. Words from this root have something to do with being pleased or being
thankful. To ingratiate yourself is to make others feel thankful for something
you've done. To congratulate is to express how pleasing someone's success is.
Similarly, to feel grateful is to feel thankful, or to feel the pleasure for
something. Gratitude is a feeling of thankfulness or of pleasure.
I want us to divert from the “Gratitude as thankfulness” mode, in which we all
operate, and shift to the “Gratitude as pleasuring” mode, in which only the supersuccessful people operate.
You see, when Oprah Winfrey speaks of her gratitude journal, she speaks of it
not as if it was a mere tool of noting thankfulness, but as a tool of noting
PLEASURE. She writes what brought her PLEASURE throughout the day,
rather than what she is merely “grateful” for.
I know it may sound like a small difference, but this small difference can be
life changing.
Gratitude is currently affiliated for many of us with a list of things that we
SHOULD do. There’s an undertone of reprimand in the word gratitude, as it
often comes along with the word SHOULD in the same sentence: “You should
be GRATEFUL that we have this ‘boring’ food on our table!” or “I know I
should feel gratitude for this present I got from him, but all I feel is sheer
disappointment.”
Yes. Gratitude to many of us holds a religious-should-obligation-must-todo’s-expected-required kind of attitude. And this CANNOT work as a mean to
LOVE yourself.
But nevertheless, the concept of gratitude is one of the most important
concepts there are. It CAN change your life. It DOES shift your mind from a
mentality of scarcity to a mentality of ‘more than enough’. It’s really powerful.
And this is why we are now to relearn this concept, in a way that sticks, in a
way that you will find pleasure in.
“Take your pleasure seriously.”

AMPLIFYING YOUR WORDS
What we are learning can really sound foreign and almost sacrilegious to those
of you hard-working-puritans-perfectionists-to-do-lists type of people.
But I care for you.
So I’m not going to give up on you.
I’m going to try and prove to you, in this chapter, that you should seek
PLEASURE in your everyday life.
I’m not saying that you should stop doing what you are doing and going
carelessly after lusts of the moment. I DIDN’T say that.
What I did say, dear, is that you MUST find TONS of pleasures in your day to
day life, if you want to be happier. Finding these moments is a MUST, and it’s a
sign to your subconscious that you LOVE yourself.
So let’s look into that – finding pleasure in your every day life.
If we look at the previous quote, by Oprah Winfrey, we see that Oprah is
advising to write down “five things every day that brought…”
Look at the EXACT wording. What’s the word?
Yep. PLEASURE. Also, “gratefulness.” But pleasure comes FIRST.
Why is it that we are so INTIMIDATED by this word, “pleasure”? It sounds
almost like a sin.
But this is what life is to be about: pleasure. Pleasure!
Speaking of Oprah, it’s no coincidence that her favorite Bible verse is Psalm
37:4: “Delight yourself in the Lord, and he will give you the desires of your
heart.”
I love this verse. The word “Delight” is a very powerful word.
Yet in today’s world we are a little afraid of such STRONG words as
“delight” or “pleasure”. We much prefer “enjoy” or “OK” or “cool”.
But, speaking of the Bible (atheists, bare with me just two more verses!) it
also says that “Death and life are in the power of the tongue.” (Proverbs 18:21)
Now, in Hebrew, the word ‘tongue’ is the same word as the word: “wording.”
Now, let’s re-read the sentence: “Death and life are in the power of the
WORDING.”
If you chose your wording WISELY, then the rest of the verse goes that you
shall “eat the fruit thereof.” The previous verse in Proverbs, just one before the
famous Death and life verse, states that “with the increase of his lips” so shall a
man “be filled.”
The point I’m trying to make is that your WORDING counts. And if you
choose your wording well, your life will become WELL. If you choose your
wording poorly, well, you understand, right?
And so, in Oprah’s favorite verse the meaning of “delight” is important,
because if you “delight” you shall rip back, as you will be provided “the desires
of your heart.”
I want to have all of my desires of my heart fulfilled! What did you say I
should do? Oh, “delight myself in your Lord.”
So where IS this Lord, this God? Everywhere. If we find DELIGHT all
around us, then we are promised we’ll be provided our desires.
That’s cool. Let’s keep with this line.
So, basically, we’ve said that instead of mere “gratitude” we should shift our
consciousness to “Find pleasure in” or “take pleasure in” our lives. We’ve said
that our wordings are important, and that they determine the quality of our lives.
Actually, one of the great Roman emperors who ever lived, a person whose book
is still revered nearly 2000 years later, Marcus Aurelius said that “The happiness
of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts.”
So we are now trying to RAISE the quality of our thoughts, and thereby
RAISE the quality of our life.
The wording of our thoughts is indeed important. There’s a reason why we’ve
encountered words as “Delight yourself” and “Desires of your heart”, and
“Pleasure”. In fact, the original Hebrew word for the word “Delight” is
equivalent to the word “Pleasure”.
Therefore that verse from Proverbs can be read “Find PLEASURE” instead of
‘delight’ and you shall receive “the desires of your heart.”
Now – let’s look at these three words:
Delight, Pleasure, Desire.
Is it only me or do they sound a little… inappropriate? A little… too…
sensual?
I guess we live in a world in which everything that is passionate is deemed
“wrong” and “improper”, even if it has nothing to do with sexuality.
But words carry ENERGY and POWER.
I want YOU and I to begin using words that have HIGH energy and power
attached to them. It’s no coincidence that Oprah speaks of Pleasure, and that the
most successful people speak of passion and pleasure ALL the time.
You may say, “Well, when I get a passionate life, I will speak with passion
and pleasure.” But my love, we know it’s the other way around. You and I must
be more daring, throw away much of our faded, dull, vague, energy-less blahwords such as “OK” and “fine”.
“How was your day? Oh, fine.”
Yuck! “How was your life? Oh, fine.”
I don’t want to have an OK-fine life. I wanna find Pleasure in life, and
through being pleasure-prone, to show love to myself, to my life. It’s simple. We
need to AMPLIFY our wording, so we can AMPLIFY our love to life.
And that’s what all the super successful people DO.
“I find my greatest pleasure, and so my
reward, in the work that precedes what
the world calls success.”
—Thomas Edison
American inventor and businessman
“I find pleasure in everything - if I'm in
a flea market, I'm there on my
downtime, but I'm also there searching
for the collection. I don't separate the
two.”
—Francisco Costa
Brazilian fashion designer
COLLECTING YOUR JOYS
So we looked into the importance of our words. And we offered to amplify our
words. We also profoundly looked at the word “Gratitude” and how it stems
from the root of “bringing pleasure”. We therefore offered to look at “Pleasure”
as our guide, rather than “gratitude”. Now we’ll look into embedding a culture of
pleasure into our life.
How does that sound: “embedding a culture of pleasure into my life.”
Does that sound good?
Or do you still have some residue of judgment and puritan criticism: “life isn’t
about having pleasure, it’s about hard work!”
So what is this “pleasure” that I elaborate about so much, and why is it SO
important?
Pleasure is one of my favorite words. Want to hear of some other favorite
words?
Delight, Enchantment, Glee, Gratification Exultation, Exhilaration, Elation,
Bliss…
These are just a few.
Shifting your consciousness to LIVING these words can be a very
GRATIFYING thing indeed.
There are many ways of shifting one’s awareness. But the easiest and most
profound way is through everyday REFLECTION.
See, if I called you each evening, and we spoke for say, five minutes, and I’d
ask you to tell me “what did you find pleasure in today?” the conversation might
go like this:
“Pleasure?” you may say.
“Yep. Pleasure. What did you take pleasure in today, what brought you
delight?”
“I…” you may hesitate, “I had a pretty good day, now, let’s see, what brought
me pleasure…”
“Or delight.”
“Yes. Well…”
The first few days would be rather odd. You’d be finishing most of your
sentences with an upward tone, like, “I guess my friend Brian called, and it was
nice…?”
But after few weeks of me calling you EVERY evening, you will be quicker.
Faster. “Oh, and also, I heard this great song I love on the radio… and I bought
this new book just as a present to myself… and also- ”
If I keep nagging you and calling you every single day, after few months
you’d begin to see that your WHOLE life has changed. The change might have
been subtle, but there was definitely a change.
When you get USED to it, you begin NOTICING things differently.
Something good happens and you immediately say: “Oh, remember this for the
evening call!”
When this happens, it means that your brain shifted to WANTING to
remember the good. You will FOCUS on what works, what’s good, what’s
pleasurable, what brings you delight. And we all know that what you FOCUS
on, EXPANDS.
When I focus on my wife Hallel’s lack of good mood recently, I might get
agitated about that. I might comment to her that she is a little snappy recently.
This is likely to bring to even more unhappiness from her, and a feeling that I
criticize her. What will expand in this case is her unhappiness.
Now, if instead, after I notice that she’s in not so good mood lately, and I
choose to FOCUS on the small things in which she IS in good mood, then I
might enjoy seeing her when she nevertheless seems happy, and comment about
that. That might bring us closer, it might open her up, we might talk, and slowly
her happiness will EXPAND.
What we focus on EXPANDS. If we focus on “I don’t have enough time”
we’ll get more of not having enough time. If we focus on “I have more than
enough time for what really matters” we’ll end up having more than enough time
for what matters. This is simple, we ALL know it.
And, similarly, if we FOCUS on what brings us pleasure and delight, it will in
turn EXPAND in our life.
I’m willing to bet you on that. On money, actually.
So, while I criticized the negative aspects of “Gratitude” (it feels like another
SHOULD, you are EXPECTED to give thanks, etc.) I nevertheless support the
actual GENUINE PRACTICE of gratitude.
We spoke about the power of questions in designing our life. Coach Tony
Robbins says that quality questions lead to a quality life. Nobel Prize Laureate,
Egyptian author Naguib Mahfouz has a wonderful quote I love:
“You can tell whether a man is clever by his answers. You can tell whether a
man is wise by his questions.”
Mahfouz puts the emphasis not on the answers we give, but on our questions.
I want to challenge you to ask a question each evening, and it should NOT be
‘what am I grateful for?’
Instead, the question should be:
“What did I find pleasure in? What delighted me today?”
And be quiet. Hold the space. In the beginning you will HATE this question,
as it speaks in a FOREIGN language. Most people speak “spoken OKnese”,
“FINEish”, “Common NOT-BADian”.
Most people don’t speak the “Rare PLEASUREish” and “Dialectic
DELIGHTian”. Actually, most people squirm when they hear people speak that
way. They may say, “What happened to HER?!” or “Someone took a WOOWOO pill!!!”
Yep. People don’t SPEAK this language around you. But don’t be upset with
them. Begin, and they will follow too.
One hundred years ago there was a crazy guy called Ben-Yehuda, who sought
to revive the dead Hebrew language, and use it as a modern language to unite
Jewish immigrants to the Holy Land. Everyone laughed at him, and eggs were
thrown at him. But years proved him right, and now modern Hebrew is spoken
by millions.
I’m asking you to adopt a NEW language. This new language will in turn
create a NEW outlook. The theory of Linguistic Relativity shows clearly that the
structure of a language affects its speakers' cognition and world view.
I invite you, strongly, to enter a new chapter in your life, to learn the language
of PLEASURE and DELIGHT through daily lessons.
Each day, write three things you took pleasure in or found delight in. It can be
really powerful.
One thing I should note, though: this should NEVER feel like a chore. If you
don’t want to write, doodle instead. Draw hearts. Whatever suits you best that
day. But keep the habit: it can take you only few minutes, and those few minutes
can change your WHOLE outlook, and your life :)

PRACTICING SELF-LOVE
We managed to cram a lot into this little book, didn’t we? Let’s review some of
the things we mentioned.
We mentioned the exercise I do each night in front of the mirror, speaking
good words to myself, and at the end - hugging myself. Does that sound like
something you might consider doing?
We spoke about putting yourself first. Constantly asking yourself, “But what
do I want?” and then doing just that.
We spoke about not giving from what you don’t have, meaning, to first give
yourself, so that then you can overflow with love, and give others from that
overflow, rather than from your own cup.
We did an exercise in which I spoke to your subconciousness, encouraging
your inner self. It may have felt odd, but it came from a very sincere place.
We spoke of not caring too much what other people say (remember? What
other people say or think of you is none of your business!), but following your
own heart.
We spoke about not running around doing things for other people all the time,
of how my father prefers being abroad because he exhausts himself pleasing
others. We spoke of how cellphones shouldn’t be allowed in the bedroom.
We spoke about practicing the word “no” and saying it once a day, or at least
once a week - learning to set your boundaries.
We did this exercise of “If I truly loved myself, I would…” and I encouraged
you to THINK what would you do differently in your life. Now write it all down,
and begin seeing to it!
We spoke of your duty to give the world a GREAT example of how to TREAT
you. And you need to give us all a good example!
We spoke of not postponing your happiness “until”, and giving it to you
RIGHT NOW. No accomplishment in the future will change your self-love
habits. Let me promise you that.
I asked you, “If today was your last day on earth, will you treat yourself the
same way?” I wonder what did you answer. I wonder what are you answering
right now.
We spoke of how we should treat ourselves like stars, and I did a little game
with you, asking you “why is it cool to be you?” and we answered, you and I. I
do hope that you participated, if not, I’ll give you only one more chance when
you reread this book. Otherwise I’m not playing again!
We spoke of how we should not use our “stories” to keep us stuck in our lives.
Rather, I gave you an example of how I strive to see my story, with difficult
moments in my childhood, as something that served me in making me more
sensitive and aware. I encourage you to look into your story that same way.
This led us to speak of forgiveness. I did this elaborate exercise in front of
you on how to forgive my former acting teacher, Jacob. It was powerful. Few
days ago I thought of him again, and my emotions were not nearly as strong. I
advised you to do the same process with someone you are angry with, not for
THEM, but for YOU. You can do it in any way you wish, most people choose to
do it in a letter, without any obligation to ever send it. It’s for YOU, do whatever
works for you, but liberate yourself from carrying the burden of anger. It’s not
good for you.
Then we took getting rid of our baggage to another level: getting rid of our
secrets. Whether by telling a secret about our past or present to a trustworthy
person, or through writing it down, we need to let go of our secrets. We spoke of
how a research showed that keeping a secret makes you feel weighed down —
literally — and even limits your ability to get things done.
We spoke of smiling yourself in the mirror. At least not just examining
yourself so critically without at least LEAVING with a smile. That’s unfair to the
child inside you!
Then we spoke at length about adoring your body. I did a whole long exercise
with you, describing how I acknowledge my forehead, my eyebrows, my nose…
I encouraged and still encourage you to do the same!
Then we spoke of some “extreme” measures. I told you how I wrote a long
love letter to myself; I told you how I wrote a love poem to myself; how I hung
pictures of me as a child all around my office. How I took that one step forward
and hung ALL KINDS of things, from diplomas, thank you letters, fun emails,
greeting cards, memorabilia and other things that make me feel love to myself.
I offered you to do the same, and to also consider creating a PowerPoint
presentation or a designated folder in your smart phone, in which you save all
your screenshots, and you make sure to capture empowering moments (for
example, whenever I receive a warm SMS from someone, I take a screenshot;
whenever I see ANYTHING I like either on my lap top or my smartphone I
capture it for my memory to be reminded over and over of the good stuff).
Then we took a necessary detour and we spoke about our inner psyche. That’s
when I brought up the three Self’s (remember which three?) and their King. We
spoke about how they work. This is a part of the book I’d recommend reading
again and again, very often, so that you will be able to start exposing your self
deprecating mechanisms, call them for who and what they are, and instead listen
to your Intuition - who will tell you its all BULL and ask you to practice self
love (she’ll also tell you EXACTLY what you need to do. She’s brilliant!).
That part is uneasy to some people. But practice does bring improvement (no
perfection - we’re throwing that word out!). So practice!
We then spoke of gratitude, it’s Latin root, and how we should think of
PLEASURE instead. I encouraged you to AMPLIFY your words, include more
words such as “delight”, “pleasure”, “bliss”, while I warned you, BEWARE of
such words as OK, not-bad, fine - your life is a collection of your days. Make
sure your days are filled with pleasure and delight over the little things, and so
will your life be one of pleasure and delight.
As you can see, we covered LOTS of things in this little book. I see it as a
little treasure, to which I packed, day by day, week by week, more and more
ideas and personal stories in order to encourage YOU (and nobody else!) to
begin PRACTICING the art of loving yourself.
The only question is: are you willing?

success. Listen to your answer, and

Greek philosopher and former slave
PRACTICING NEVERTHELESS
We just went through a short summary of what we covered in this book. The
question now is, whether this book will be yet another nice read in your selfhelp, becoming a shelf-help rather than a true self-help – helping the books on
your shelf rather than your own wellbeing?
I’m going to be a little bit in your face this chapter. Please forgive me, but I’m
doing this FOR you.
We covered so much good in this book. Not because of ME as a writer, but
because of the timeless principles it presented.
But for me, it will be a mere insult if you just move on without at least
committing to two things you learnt in this book. Otherwise, my effort would
feel to me a vain one. All of my honesty, my genuine and sincere interest in your
success, in your ever-increasing self love, will be in vain.
You see, there’s a reason why I mentioned below the previous quote the fact
the author of the quote was an ex-slave.
Epictetus was a guy that was born a slave, and yet through education he was
able to liberate himself and become a great philosopher. His philosophy helped
countless of people. Especially, it helped convicts and prisoners throw their old
habits of self-sabotage, and become truly free. For example, James Stockdale, an
American fighter pilot who became a prisoner of war during the Vietnam War,
credited Epictetus with helping him endure seven and a half years in a North
Vietnamese military prison—including torture—and four years in solitary
confinement.
Personally, I’m an amateur when it comes to Epictetus, but I do feel very
close to him when I hear him say: “Practice yourself, for heaven's sake, in little
things, and then proceed to greater.”
I almost see him nodding his head from side to side in disapproval, saying,
“for heaven’s sake, what’s good is reading Jonathan’s book if you aren’t willing
to practice the little things?”
I feel that we often run in life after great promises. Surely I’ve done so for
many years, and I still fall into this trap now and then. I love self-help books. I
long for the feeling of hope that I get in a beginning of book. I love the feeling of
optimism that I have when I end it.
But I have learnt that I need to take PRACTICAL things and INCORPORATE
them into my life, if I want to see ANY change.
And so I want to challenge you:
Will you commit to speaking yourself fondly in front of the mirror, and to
writing three things that brought you pleasure each day?
Will you commit to hanging up pictures from your childhood, looking at them
every day, while also taking two minutes each day to listen to your Intuition?
Will you commit to saying one ‘no’ each week, celebrating it and writing it as
a success in a victory log you’ll keep by your bed; will you also commit to
writing a poem of love to yourself?
Will you be willing to commit to taking half a day once a month, to process
the forgiveness process in your mind, and forgiving four people who you feel
resentment for? Will you also commit to read two or three pages in this book
every day in the next six months?
Will you commit to capturing screenshots of things that bring you joy, and
looking through the folder once a day for few minutes on your smartphone or
computer? Will you smile to yourself each and every time you pass by a mirror
or a window, for at least five seconds?
Will you do the body acknowledgement exercise, going through each part of
your body and expressing love, gratitude and apologizing for your judgment –
once every three months? Will you ask yourself each day at lunch, “If this was
my last day, will I be treating myself the same way?”
Will you commit to a moment of privacy each day, or half a day of privacy
each week? Will you not allow cellphones in the bedroom?
Will you commit to reading to yourself the chapter I wrote for your
subconciousness, each day, until you will replace it with your own?
Will you commit to never saying “Yes” but instead, “Can I get back to you on
that tomorrow”? Will you play the “I’m cool because” game once a day for 30
days?
Will you sit down to rewrite your life’s story – and to find out all the reasons
why that dark stain is actually serving you today? Will you commit to reading
the chapters about letting go of your secrets, and read it each day for however
long it takes till you get the courage to confide in someone or to write your
secret down?
My question to you is: what will you commit to?
Write to me: j@kis-lev.com
I want to hear what are YOU committed to.

RECREATING YOURSELF
I did MEAN it. Write to me. I WANT you to commit. I want you to improve
your life. More than anything, I want you to improve your relationship with
yourself.
We have this belief that we are who we are, “that’s the way I am.”
We see ourselves as a finished sculpture.
Let’s look at that for a moment.
I studied sculpting in art school, and learnt a lot about working with clay. This
is relevant to us as human beings, as many ancient traditions compared the
human being to clay. Even the Bible states, “We are the clay, you are the potter”
(Isaiah 64:8), and some translations translate the Hebrew word of “dust” to
“clay”, implying that instead of reading Genesis 3:19 as: “for dust you are...” we
should read instead “for CLAY you are and to CLAY you will return."
Now, clay, I learnt in art school, and you probably know it too, is never really
‘done’ until you burn it. It may SEEM hard as a rock. It may FEEL
unchangeable. But unless it has been burnt, it is still SHAPABLE.
Now, to rescue an old piece of clay that you want to reshape, you need to soak
it in tons of water, while giving it also lots of air (cause yucky fumes come out).
You want to give it some time to really soak up the water.
After a while it gets tid bit softer, and it’s time for you to start pressing on it,
molding it with your hands, until it becomes softer, then you can begin really
remolding it, and it’s easy to work with, it’s like butter!
Most of us, as people, think of us as a finished burnt product. Yet we are
NEVER burnt. We can always remold ourselves.
What you just did, through reading this book, is to soak yourself up in water.
Was it enough? Only you can tell. Some people need to read this book few times
before they get a little ‘softer’ so that they can start ‘remolding’ themselves.
They might feel, as Potters call it, that they are ‘bone-dry’ and that they need to
soak more. “Soaking” can be reading and rereading, taking notes, highlighting,
whatever wraps your mind around the information and energy in this book.
In the beginning, when you try to use your mental hands and mold yourself
into the more self-loving person you want to become, you will find while you
are softer, you are not yet malleable. Potters call it ‘leather hard’ – when the clay
needs more movement, to be molded with your hands again and again, while
making sure it has enough moisture.
This is what practice is for. Each time you repeat your habit of self-love, you
are making yourself more flexible. I promise you that with time you WILL
become easily molded into the person you want to be. Add some ‘water’ and
‘moisture’ on your hands by reading this book again and again, and steeping
yourself in the quotes, in a moment we’ll speak about the importance of the
quotes. But basically, remember that each month you keep up with your daily
habit, you are becoming softer.
After a long period of time, it may be months or even years, you’ll find that
you are UNRECOGNIZABLE. Oh yes. That’s when you look at yourself, at
your sweet loving self, at the person who is so self-loving and self-nurturing, and
you don’t recognize yourself. That’s when you have become so ‘plastic’ or
‘malleable’. You have designed yourself according to YOUR mental and
spiritual hands, rather than according to your LIFE’s circumstances.
That’s when you participate in the divine CREATION. That’s when you are
closest to God, to the FLOW of the universe. That’s when you ARE love, and
you ARE joy.
Sure, you will harden at times. You will need more water, more inspiration,
new habits or revitalizing your old ones. But still, you will be a different person.
A person to YOUR liking, to YOUR design. And that is BLISS.

to carve it, like a sculpture.”

STEEPING YOURSELF
I KNOW that you can change yourself, change your life. I did it myself, and I
keep doing it.
I remember sitting once in a lecture, and the lecturer said, “These days I don’t
have that negative inner chatter anymore. It took many years of work, but it’s
pretty much gone. Now it’s mostly positive talk that I have inside, with only the
occasional lapses, you know…”
I remember how hearing the lecturer made my heart feel. It’s as if the words
were like a beacon of light for my darkened heart.
At the time I was not believing my feeling of being not worthy of love will
ever go away.
At the time I thought I needed to EARN someone’s love.
And that included myself. For me to be nice to myself, I had to work really
hard, achieve extraordinary things, and then I might get a pat on the shoulder
from myself.
My self-talk was one that I do not wish for anyone to have. It was
NEGATIVE.
Sure, from the outside you might have thought that I have it altogether. I was
a young artist, making a living from his art in his mid-20s. Not bad. But I was in
an unhealthy romantic relationship, which resembled all too much the
relationship I had just left.
Intellectually I THOUGHT that I should be deserving of love and
appreciation. But I didn’t FEEL it, you know?
I remember once, how someone said that every baby deserves to be loved.
And my inner voice objected. ANY baby?? Really? What if… Well, what if…
—
I couldn’t come up with a sufficient excuse why a baby shouldn’t be loved,
but inside I felt like I – me – I was THAT baby, the one who shouldn’t be loved.
It’s hard for me to write these words. In fact these might be the most personal
words I shared with you, and I think I shared some personal words with you. But
this, well, I don’t remember telling about it to anyone, really.
My self-talk was leading me to depression, to unhappiness, to constant work.
I used to overwork myself, exhaust myself.
At this time of insufficient sleeping, of negative inner-attitude, I began to have
awful back pains.
I cleaned the bathroom in a shared studio I was renting, it was my turn. I had
to head somewhere immediately afterwards, and I was in a rush. All of a sudden
I felt an enormous pain, and found myself unable to keep standing. I fell to the
floor.
This marked the beginning of some three years of horrific lower-back-pain. It
would paralyze me for days, sometimes for weeks. When it did, I had to lean on
the wall going from my bed to the bathroom and back.
At the time my body was signaling to me something I didn’t want to hear. My
body was saying: “SLOW DOWN!” and also “BE KIND TO YOURSELF!”
But all I was hearing was a distant echo, passing through thick forests of selfloathing and self-criticism. Was there self-hatred there too? Probably.
And Intuition, my lovely Intuition, she was nowhere to be found. I didn’t
know how to listen to her.
They say that when it rains it pours. I was in the second romantic relationship
that had some elements of… abuse.
Why am I censoring my words? Guess I’m afraid of your judgment. The truth
is that it was filled with elements of abuse. And so was the previous relationship.
I just couldn’t attract a good relationship to my life.
My business was going well, but I had to sweat for it. It didn’t come easily.
And every few months I would find myself doing some movement, whether it
is closing the baggage door of the bus, carrying paintings from place to place –
and all of a sudden a huge pain would attack me, and I would be paralyzed for a
week, going to my parents’ home or staying and lamenting my poor fate in my
shared apartment, living with an incommunicative roommate I couldn’t talk too,
who left his dishes in the sink till they piled and I had to beg him not to do it
again. And he did.
So, my self-talk, my self-esteem, my self-love - were at a low moment. I was
on the fast track to long term unhappiness.
And what hurt the most was the relationship, feeling unloved and unaccepted
for who I was.
Oh my God, it’s SOOO hard for me to even recall this time in my life.
But something within me caused me to change. I began going to a shrink (I
mentioned that earlier). I also began reading Chicken Soup for the Soul again. I
liked these books.
In my late teens I read a couple of them, and loved them. But when my
girlfriend then found out I read them, she laughed at me.
I then put them aside. When it came time to pack in Canada and go back to
Israel, I left the book outside the suitcase.
But in my mid-20s, with a new girlfriend, I began reading this book again,
and others in the series. And I watched some lectures by this Jack Canfield guy,
who co-wrote these books. I liked him. He seemed so… gentle and genuine.
In one of his interviews he told about a workshop he did each summer, which
was one week long. He said it falls each year on his birthday, and that he loves
celebrating his birthday that way, while being in a workshop setting encouraging
people to go for their dreams.
I liked the fact he did that on his BIRTHDAY. And so, I began looking online
for details.
And I signed up.
I haven’t been to the States for several years, and the flights and the hotel
costs were pretty high. But I said, “This is for myself.”
In that one workshop I felt… as if… I returned home. I cried a lot. I laughed a
lot. I danced, I hugged, I felt at home. Better than the ‘home’ I knew. Real
HOME. Like I could be MYSELF.
I hurried to sign up for a year long training with Canfield. It included four
separate one-week-long workshops with him, and then I’d be a certified trainer, a
sort of a coach.
Should I sign? I didn’t want to be a trainer. But I LOVED the work. And Jack
proved to be very genuine and loving.
I committed to a program that cost me basically all of my savings, and more.
“This,” I said to myself, “is for ME.”
The next year I kept flying every few months to California for another
workshop. One time, few days before the workshop, I was working hard to
prepare few paintings before my 10 days away, when suddenly my back went
out again.
Laying in my bed for the third day, with the flight approaching, I couldn’t
imagine not going. I hurriedly tried two different physical therapies that didn’t
work.
I called the airport and the airline, and arranged for a wheelchair to be ready
for me in the three airports.
Being taken around on a wheelchair in a crowded airport, at the age of 26, felt
a little unnerving. What made me a handicap? Well, I guess the way I
overworked myself? It felt dumb. I felt stupid, and that nourished even more my
cycle of self-loathing.
But I GOT there. Seeing the people I came to call my new friends, people
committed to self-growth, made me extremely happy, and made my pain ease a
little. I nevertheless had to lay on the carpet whenever my back was unwilling to
keep sitting on the chair.
In between each workshop we had to have a sort of a coaching talk in small
groups on Skype once or twice a week. That’s when I was advised to begin
saying ‘no’ to some of my obligations.
Also, it was in that time that I realized, painfully as it was, that my romantic
relationship AGAIN was not working. Though I tried to put my everything into
the relationship, I had to end it.
Months later, surfing on dating sites, I began writing love letters to myself,
and trying to treat myself in the way I wanted others to treat me.
I then met Hallel. And I felt like my life was going in a better direction.
Each year since then seems to be better than the last. I’m still not where I
want to be – I want to reach a stage in which my self-talk is extremely positive. I
want to care less and less what others think. I want to be out there, in the world,
doing and saying and standing for what I believe in, even though some people
won’t like my opinions. I feel that I have so much that I want to give the world,
and I hope to find myself each year feeling more and more confident.
But I must say that where I am today is a miracle in comparison to where I’ve
been. I used to have other people manage me. I used to feel torn between trying
to please this gallery owner, that non-profit I was volunteering for, my parents,
siblings, friends, girlfriend – I used to be so… unclear as to what I wanted.
These days I feel like I HAVE myself. Like I’m here for ME. Like my job is
to ultimately make ME happy first, and only then the others. Others being my
wife, my beautiful baby girl – I cannot give them from what I don’t have myself.
I therefore am constantly aware as to when I need time for myself, when I need a
vacation on my own, when I need to be away from the cellphone for few hours,
walking in the woods, dancing in my office, writing in my diary…
I take time for ME. I say NO quite often. I tell the truth even when I know the
other side won’t be happy with me. I took my parents and me to a therapy, and
we’re working on things. They are very brave.
I tell Hallel when something she says or does doesn’t feel pleasant for me. We
talk. Real TALKING, I feel that she truly SEES me, you know? She’s one of the
greatest encouragements in my life, possibly the greatest after my own inner
super-manly cheerleader ;)
These days I hug our baby girl, six-months old Sarah, a lot. In fact, she is
laying on the carpet next to me right now, as I write. A Karen Drucker song,
“I’m Gentle With Myself is played on repeat on my computer. It’s midmorning,
summer in the Galilee, and the sun is bright through the window.
I look at Sarah and I think that she is gorgeous. I do think that every child
needs to be fully and wholly loved. And yes, without conditions, without
prerequisites. Having her makes me understand how I should treat myself. Karen
Drucker’s voice sings, “I will only go as fast as the slowest part of me feels safe
to go.”
And I find these words wise. “I will be easy on myself, and I’ll love myself
like a newborn baby child.”
I realize today that my parents, my grandparents, my siblings, my teachers,
everyone around me did the best they could. And I realize that I needed more.
Now I’m giving it to myself.
“Create the kind of self that you will be
happy to live with all your life. Make
the most of yourself by fanning the tiny,
inner sparks of possibility into flames of
achievement.”

OTHER JONATHAN KIS-LEV BOOKS
Readers have asked me to include a section at the end of the book and speak of
my other books. This section is therefore dedicated to all of you, my readers.
I’ve always loved writing, since childhood. Writing as well as reading (can
you guess I was a real nerd?). For me, books were a way to expand my world. To
travel. To “wake up”. In the little village I grew up in books were all I had.
Television was okay. But books – they were magnificent…!
I therefore always wanted to be a writer. In my early twenties I won an
encouraging prize from an Israeli magazine called Bamahane for a short story I
wrote. Yet it was only in my late 20s that I felt inclined to write a whole book: I
realized back then that much of the lessons which helped me in my life came
from my own tradition, from Judaism, from the holidays, from customs and
sayings, from my parents’ and grandparents’ wisdom.
I therefore sat down and wrote for over a year a book which I called
“Chutzpah: Success Secrets from My Jewish Upbringing”. This book is filled
with stories, anecdotes and lessons from Judaism. I believe that it helps explain
why the Jews, who comprise only a half of one percent of the world’s
population, receive some 20 percent of the Nobel Prizes. It has nothing to do
with genes, but with a way of thinking about service, and purpose, and calling...
It’s a very personal book, I share much about my grandfather, what I learned in
my Bar Mitzvah ceremony, what are the key lessons imparted to children in each
holiday and how, in my opinion, they shape the children into adults who want to
contribute to the world. The book is filled with many photos as well, covering
3000 years of Jewish thought – but doing so in a simple and captivating way. I’d
love for you to read it.
I then proceeded to write a book about pain and loss and hope in the Middle
East. Ever since age eleven I participated in numerous peace programs between
Israelis and Palestinians. These personal encounters not only won me Arab
friends but also taught me quite a few valuable lessons about peacemaking. It’s
an emotional book, which I guarantee will not only make you moved, but also
make you hopeful. It portrays the movement for peace in both sides of the
conflict, a movement about which you rarely hear in the news... This book is
called “My Quest For Peace: One Israeli’s Journey from Hatred to
Peacemaking” and I’m super proud of it.
One of the key ways for me to work for peace has been my art. Since my
early 20s I was fortunate enough to be able to make a living from my art,
painting large canvases and selling them in galleries around the world. Many
artists have asked me over the years how come I was able to achieve that level of
success with my art. Between you and me – it wasn’t really my talent. There are
artists who are way better than I am. It was instead a set of values which I
adopted from several older artist mentors I found. These values and valuable
lessons made me successful in a field which most people affiliate with starving
and suffering and being poor. Right?
Over the years, I shared these valuable lessons with many artists – not only
with painters, but also with musicians, writers, and anyone interested. This led
me to writing my third book, which I called “Masterwork: a Guide to All Artists
on Turning from Amateurs into Masters”. It’s a beautiful book, filled with
inspiring quotes by the history’s greatest artists. I speak a lot in that book about
the importance of finding a mentor and how to find one, of how originality isn’t
important but authenticity is crucial, and why the old myth of money spoiling
the quality of art simply has to be thrown out the window. Many artists have
reported to me that this book was a game changer for them, and I’m honored
each time I hear that. “Masterwork” is an ideal gift to anyone you know who is
into the arts or wishes to take their hobby to the next level.
My fourth book was not really a book. It was a journal. As part of my daily
habits, I tried for many years to write five things each day for which I was
grateful. This led me to design a journal that I would love to write in myself:
each page has a date written on top. Five small lines are laid out for you to just
jot down five things for which you’re grateful. But the cream of the cake is a
small picture frame for you to doodle in for few seconds. Those few seconds of
doodling, gives a rather fun thing to do at the end of the day. At the bottom of
the page I put an inspiring quote by people such as Gandhi or Oprah Winfrey or
Eleanor Roosevelt - different quotes each day. For me, it’s the perfect way to
close the day before going to bed.
I called this journal “Gratitude Doodle: The One Minute a Day that Can
Change Your Life.” In it, there are a few chapters about the importance of
gratitude, and an explanation as to how to use the journal to get the most out of
it. I’m proud to say that there are whole families using it, each person in the
family having their own copy. My wife Hallel and I also write in ours daily. It’s a
neat thing. It’s one of the best ways I know to turn your life around and become
more positive and grateful for all the good we have and forget to notice.
Another key way with which I bring joy to my life is affirmations. While for
most of my adult life I doubted the benefits of reading out loud positive phrases,
in recent years I nevertheless found that it… works! I compiled over two
hundred of my favorite empowering affirmations, and designed a book that is the
most aesthetically pleasing book I could have ever envisioned. Each affirmation
is given its own unique botanical illustration (gorgeous!). Flowers, plants, and
even birds and butterflies fill each page, and it’s impossible to not feel tranquil
when you read it.
This book is called “Better Thoughts, Better Life: Super Powerful
Affirmations to Snap You Out of the Funk in Two Minutes or Less.” In it I also
thoroughly explain about how to rewire our minds. Research shows that most of
our thoughts are negative. A trained mind can shift that. I am working on it
myself, and I’m glad to report that due to using affirmations, my negative innerchatter has dramatically subsided. I look at this book, “Better Thoughts, Better
Life” as the best gift you can give yourself. It’s simple, but true: when you
improve your thoughts, you improve your life. That’s what “Better Thoughts,
Better Life” is all about.
I followed that book with a book about choosing happiness. Over the years I
learned that in each and every moment I have a choice. A simple choice: I can
either focus on what doesn’t work, or on what brings me pleasure in that
moment. It’s a simple exercise that can be overlooked due to its simplicity. But it
is as powerful as gravity. Every other moment during the day I shift my thoughts
from negative to positive ones. This enables me to be happier, as well as makes
me more motivated to achieve more in life. It’s really powerful. I wrote a small
book about this habit and how to acquire it, and called it “Every Other Moment:
A Manual on Choosing Happiness”. I love it. It’s a great reminder about the
power we have at each given moment to change our lives for the better.
Being a rather positive guy, over the years I encouraged many friends around
me to go for their dreams, to get that ideal job, to ask for a raise, to create a side
business. I noticed how many of my women friends had a harder time boasting
about their abilities than my friends who are men. This puzzled me for many
years, and it wasn’t until the last five years, where I found myself with a highly
capable woman as my partner, that I began questioning why is that. Why is that
that women tend to be smarter than men (there’s research to back this up) but at
the same time don’t toot their horns nearly as much? Why do women don’t tend
to negotiate their salaries like men do? And why do women attribute their
success to luck while men attribute their success to their own doing?
This led me into writing a very emotional guide for women called “Brag
Woman Brag!” This book is my gift to my wife, my mother, my daughter, my
sisters, and all of my friends who happen to be women. I quote many researches
showing how there is a negative bias toward girls who lead. Boys who lead are
called ‘strong’, while girls who lead are called ‘bossy’. I take the reader through
a very profound emotional journey to rediscover their power. It’s my gift to
women. And even the most skeptic of women, who have disliked the title, the
cover, and the whole idea, write to me back saying “Wow.” I cried over reading
some of the emails from readers of “Brag Woman Brag”, simply because this
book hits a nerve. I hope that in a few years it will become irrelevant. But for
now, it is one of the most relevant topics each woman (and man) should explore.
It’s important for us ALL to own our power.
All of these books are available both electronically, as well as in print. You
can find them easily online. Thank you for your support and interest!
Jonathan.

BEFORE YOU READ THIS BOOK
A Question
cereal bowl gets thrown across the kitchen, splattering milk
and Cheerios all over the wall.
The dog runs in from the backyard and has inexplicably been
painted blue.
One of your kids threatens a younger sibling.
You get a call from the principal’s oɽce for the third time this
month.
What do you do?
Before you answer, we want to ask you to completely forget
about everything you know about discipline. Forget what you think
the word means, and forget what you’ve heard about how parents
should respond when kids do something they’re not supposed to.
Instead, ask yourself a question: Are you open to at least
thinking about a diʃerent approach to discipline? One that helps
you achieve your immediate goals of getting your kids to do the
right thing in the moment, as well as your longer-range goals of
helping them become good people who are happy, successful, kind,
responsible, and even self-disciplined?
If so, this book is for you.

INTRODUCTION
Relational, Low-Drama Discipline: Encouraging
Cooperation While Building a Child’s Brain
ou are not alone.
If you feel at a loss when it comes to getting your kids to
argue less or speak more respectfully … if you can’t ɹgure out how
to keep your toddler from climbing up to the top bunk, or get him
to put on clothes before answering the front door … if you feel
frustrated having to utter the same phrase over and over again
(“Hurry! You’re going to be late for school!”) or to engage in
another battle over bedtime or homework or screen time … if
you’ve experienced any of these frustrations, you are not alone.
In fact, you’re not even unusual. You know what you are? A
parent. A human being, and a parent.
It’s hard to figure out how to discipline our kids. It just is. All too
often it goes like this: They do something they shouldn’t do. We get
mad. They get upset. Tears ɻow. (Sometimes the tears belong to
the kids.)
It’s exhausting. It’s infuriating. All the drama, the yelling, the
hurt feelings, the guilt, the heartache, the disconnection.
Do you ever ɹnd yourself asking, after an especially agonizing
interaction with your kids,
“Can’t I do better than this? Can’t I
handle myself better, and be a more eʃective parent? Can’t I
discipline in ways that calm the situation rather than create more
chaos?” You want the bad behavior to stop, but you want to
respond in a way that values and enhances your relationship with
your children. You want to build your relationship, not damage it.
You want to create less drama, not more.
You can.
In fact, that’s the central message of this book: You really can
discipline in a way that’s full of respect and nurturing, but that also
maintains clear and consistent boundaries. In other words, you can do
better. You can discipline in a way that’s high on relationship, high
on respect, and low on drama and conɻict—and in the process, you
can foster development that builds good relationship skills and
improves your children’s ability to make good decisions, think
about others, and act in ways that prepare them for lifelong success
and happiness.
We’ve talked to thousands and thousands of parents all over the
world, teaching them basics about the brain and how it affects their
relationship with their kids, and we’ve seen how hungry parents
are to learn to address children’s behavior in ways that are more
respectful and more eʃective. Parents are tired of yelling so much,
tired of seeing their kids get so upset, tired of their children
continuing to misbehave. These parents know the kind of discipline
they don’t want to use, but they don’t know what to do instead.
They want to discipline in a kind and loving way, but they feel
exhausted and overwhelmed when it comes to actually getting their
kids to do what they’re supposed to do. They want discipline that
works and that they feel good about.
In this book, we’ll introduce you to what we call a No-Drama,
Whole-Brain approach to discipline, oʃering principles and
strategies that will remove most of the drama and high emotions
that so typically characterize discipline. As a result, your life as a
parent will be easier and your parenting will become more
eʃective. More important, you’ll create connections in your
children’s brains that build emotional and social skills that will
serve them now and throughout their entire life—all while
strengthening your relationship with them. What we hope you’ll
discover is that the moments when discipline is called for are
actually some of the most important moments of parenting, times
when we have the opportunity to shape our children most
powerfully. When these challenges arise—and they will—you’ll be
able to look at them not merely as dreaded discipline situations full
of anger and frustration and drama, but as opportunities to connect
with your children and redirect them toward behavior that better
serves them and your whole family.
If you are an educator, therapist, or coach who is also
responsible for the growth and well-being of children, you will ɹnd
that these techniques work just as well for your students, patients
and clients, or teams. Recent discoveries about the brain give us
deep insights into the children we care for, what they need, and
how to discipline them in ways that foster optimal development.
We’ve written this book for anyone who cares for a child and is
interested in loving, scientiɹcally informed, eʃective strategies to
help children grow well. We’ll use the word “parent” throughout
the book, but if you’re a grandparent, a teacher, or some other
signiɹcant person in the life of a child, this book is also for you.
Our lives are more meaningful with collaboration, and this joining
together can begin with the many adults who cooperate in the
nurturing of a child in the earliest days of life onward. We hope all
children have many caregivers in their lives who are intentional
about how they interact with them and, when necessary, discipline
them in ways that build skills and enhance their relationship.
Reclaiming the Word “Discipline”
Let’s begin with the actual goal of discipline. When your child
misbehaves, what do you want to accomplish? Are consequences
your ultimate goal? In other words, is the objective to punish?
Of course not. When we’re angry, we may feel like we want to
punish our child. Irritation, impatience, frustration, or just being
unsure can make us feel that. It’s totally understandable—even
common. But once we’ve calmed down and cleaned the raw egg
out of everyone’s hair, we know that giving consequences is not
our ultimate goal.
So what do we want? What is the goal of discipline?
Well, let’s start with a formal deɹnition. The word “discipline”
comes directly from the Latin word disciplina, which was used as
far back as the eleventh century to mean teaching, learning, and
giving instruction. So, from its inception in the English language,
“discipline” has meant “to teach.”
These days, most people associate only punishment or
consequences with the practice of discipline. It’s like the mother
with the eighteen-month-old son who asked Dan: “I’m doing a lot
of teaching with Sam, but when do I start disciplining him?” The
mother saw that she needed to address her son’s behaviors, and she
assumed that punishment is what discipline is meant to be.
As you read the rest of this book, we want you to keep in mind
what Dan explained: that whenever we discipline our kids, our
overall goal is not to punish or to give a consequence, but to teach.
The root of “discipline” is the word disciple, which means
“student,
” “pupil,
” and “learner.” A disciple, the one receiving
discipline, is not a prisoner or recipient of punishment, but one
who is learning through instruction. Punishment might shut down a
behavior in the short term, but teaching oʃers skills that last a
lifetime.
We thought a lot about whether we even wanted to use the word
“discipline” in our title. We weren’t sure what to call this practice
of setting limits while still being emotionally attuned to our
children, this approach that centers on teaching and working with
our kids to help them build the skills to make good choices. We
decided that we want to reclaim the word “discipline,
” along with
its original meaning. We want to completely reframe the whole
discussion and differentiate discipline from punishment.
Essentially, we want caregivers to begin to think of discipline as one
of the most loving and nurturing things we can do for kids. Our
children need to learn skills like inhibiting impulses, managing big
angry feelings, and considering the impact of their behavior on
others. Learning these essentials of life and relationships is what
they need, and if you can provide it for them, you’ll be oʃering a
signiɹcant gift not only to your children, but to your whole family
and even the rest of the world. Seriously. This is not mere
hyperbole. No-Drama Discipline, as we’ll describe it in the coming
pages, will help your kids become the people they are meant to be,
improving their ability to control themselves, respect others,
participate in deep relationships, and live moral and ethical lives.
Just think, then, about the generational impact that will have as
they grow up with these gifts and abilities, and raise children of
their own, who can then pass on these same gifts to future
generations!
It begins with rethinking what discipline really means,
reclaiming it as a term that’s not about punishment or control, but
about teaching and skill building—and doing so from a place of
love, respect, and emotional connection.
The Dual Goals of No-Drama Discipline
Eʃective discipline aims for two primary goals. The ɹrst is
obviously to get our kids to cooperate and do the right thing. In the
heat of the moment, when our child is throwing a toy in a
restaurant or being rude or refusing to do homework, we simply
want her to act like she’s supposed to. We want her to stop
throwing the toy. We want her to communicate respectfully. We
want her to get her homework done.
With a small child, achieving the ɹrst goal, cooperation, might
involve getting him to hold your hand as he crosses the street, or
helping him put down the bottle of olive oil he’s swinging like a
baseball bat in aisle 4 at the grocery store. For an older child it
might mean problem-solving with him to do his chores in a more
timely fashion, or discussing how his sister might feel about the
phrase “fat-butted lonely girl.”
You’ll hear us say it repeatedly throughout the book: every child
is diʃerent, and no parenting approach or strategy will work every
time. But the most obvious goal in all of these situations is to elicit
cooperation and to help a child behave in ways that are acceptable
(like using kind words, or putting dirty clothes in the hamper) and
avoid behaviors that aren’t (like hitting, or touching the gum
someone left under the table at the library). This is the short-term
goal of discipline.
For many people, that’s the only goal: gaining immediate
cooperation. They want their kids to stop doing something they
shouldn’t be doing or begin doing something they should be doing.
That’s why we so often hear parents use phrases like “Stop it now!”
and the timeless “Because I said so!”
But really, we want more than mere cooperation, don’t we? Of
course we want to prevent the breakfast spoon from becoming a
weapon. Of course we want to promote kind and respectful
actions, and reduce the insults and belligerence.
But there’s a second goal that’s just as important, and whereas
getting cooperation is the short-term objective, this second goal is
more long-term. It focuses on instructing our children in ways that
develop skills and the capacity to resiliently handle challenging
situations, frustrations, and emotional storms that might make
them lose control. These are the internal skills that can be
generalized beyond the immediate behavior in the moment and
then used not only now, but later in a variety of situations. This
internal, second major goal of discipline is about helping them
develop self-control and a moral compass, so that even when
authority ɹgures aren’t around, they are thoughtful and
conscientious. It’s about helping them grow up and become kind
and responsible people who can enjoy successful relationships and
meaningful lives.
We call this a Whole-Brain approach to discipline because, as
we’ll explain, when we use the whole of our own brain as parents,
we can focus on both the immediate external teachings and the
long-term internal lessons. And when our children receive this form
of intentional teaching, they, too, come to use their whole brains.
Over the generations, countless theories have cropped up about
how to help our children “grow up right.” There was the “spare the
rod and spoil the child” school, and its opposite, the “free to be you
and me” school. But in the last twenty years or so, during what’s
been called “the decade of the brain” and the years that have
followed, scientists have discovered an immense amount of
information about the way the brain works, and it has plenty to
tell us about loving, respectful, consistent, effective discipline.
We now know that the way to help a child develop optimally is
to help create connections in her brain—her whole brain—that
develop skills that lead to better relationships, better mental
health, and more meaningful lives. You could call it brain
sculpting, or brain nourishing, or brain building. Whatever phrase
you prefer, the point is crucial, and thrilling: as a result of the
words we use and the actions we take, children’s brains will
actually change, and be built, as they undergo new experiences.
Eʃective discipline means that we’re not only stopping a bad behavior
or promoting a good one, but also teaching skills and nurturing the
connections in our children’s brains that will help them make better
decisions and handle themselves well in the future. Automatically.
Because that’s how their brains will have been wired. We’re
helping them understand what it means to manage their emotions,
to control their own impulses, to consider others’ feelings, to think
about consequences, to make thoughtful decisions, and much more.
We’re helping them develop their brains and become people who
are better friends, better siblings, better sons and daughters, and
better human beings. Then, one day, better parents themselves.
As a huge bonus, the more we help build our kids’ brains, the
less we have to struggle to achieve the short-term goal of gaining
cooperation. Encouraging cooperation and building the brain: these
are the dual goals—the external and the internal—that guide a
loving, eʃective, Whole-Brain approach to discipline. It’s parenting
with the brain in mind!
Accomplishing Our Goals: Saying No to the Behavior, but Yes to the
Child
How do parents typically accomplish their discipline goals? Most
commonly, through threats and punishment. Kids misbehave, and
the immediate parental reaction is to oʃer consequences with both
guns blazing.


Kids act, parents react, then kids react. Rinse, lather, repeat. And
for many parents—probably for most parents—consequences (along
with a healthy dose of yelling) are pretty much the primary go- to
discipline strategy: time-outs, spanking, taking away a privilege,
grounding, and on and on. No wonder there’s so much drama! But
as we’ll explain, it’s possible to discipline in a way that actually
removes many of the reasons we give consequences in the ɹrst
place.
To take it even further, consequences and punitive reactions are
actually often counterproductive, not only in terms of building brains,
but even when it comes to getting kids to cooperate. Based on our
personal and clinical experience, as well as the latest science about
the developing brain, we can tell you that automatically giving
consequences is not the best way to accomplish the goals of
discipline.
What is? That’s the foundation of the No-Drama Discipline
approach, and it comes down to one simple phrase: connect and
redirect.
Connect and Redirect
Again, every child, like every parenting situation, is diʃerent. But
one constant that’s true in virtually every encounter is that the ɹrst
step in eʃective discipline is to connect with our children
emotionally. Our relationship with our kids should be central to
everything we do. Whether we’re playing with them, talking with
them, laughing with them, or, yes, disciplining them, we want
them to experience at a deep level the full force of our love and
aʃection, whether we’re acknowledging an act of kindness or
addressing a misbehavior. Connection means that we give our kids
our attention, that we respect them enough to listen to them, that
we value their contribution to problem solving, and that we
communicate to them that we’re on their side—whether we like
the way they’re acting or not.
When we discipline we want to join with our kids in a deep way
that demonstrates how much we love them. In fact, when our
children are misbehaving, that’s often when they most need
connection with us. Disciplinary responses should change based on
a child’s age, temperament, and stage of development, along with
the context of the situation. But the constant throughout the entire
disciplinary interaction should be the clear communication of the
deep connection between parent and child. Relationship trumps
any one particular behavior.
However, connection isn’t the same thing as permissiveness.
Connecting with our kids during discipline doesn’t mean letting
them do whatever they want. In fact, just the opposite. Part of
truly loving our kids, and giving them what they need, means
oʃering them clear and consistent boundaries, creating predictable
structure in their lives, as well as having high expectations for
them. Children need to understand the way the world works:
what’s permissible and what’s not. A well-deɹned understanding of
rules and boundaries helps them achieve success in relationships
and other areas of their lives. When they learn about structure in
the safety of their home, they will be better able to ɻourish in
outside environments—school, work, relationships—where they’ll
face numerous expectations for appropriate behavior. Our children
need repeated experiences that allow them to develop wiring in
their brain that helps them delay gratiɹcation, contain urges to
react aggressively toward others, and ɻexibly deal with not getting
their way. The absence of limits and boundaries is actually quite
stressful, and stressed kids are more reactive. So when we say no
and set limits for our children, we help them discover
predictability and safety in an otherwise chaotic world. And we
build brain connections that allow kids to handle diɽculties well in
the future.
In other words, deep, empathic connection can and should be
combined with clear and ɹrm boundaries that create needed structure
in children’s lives. That’s where “redirect” comes in. Once we’ve
connected with our child and helped her calm herself so she can
hear us and fully understand what we’re saying, we can then
redirect her toward more appropriate behavior and help her see a
better way to handle herself.
But keep in mind, redirection is rarely going to be successful
while a child’s emotions are running high. Consequences and
lessons are ineʃective as long as a child is upset and unable to hear
the lessons you’re oʃering. It’s like trying to teach a dog to sit
while he’s ɹghting another dog. A ɹghting dog won’t sit. But if you
can help a child calm down, receptiveness will emerge and allow
her to understand what you’re trying to tell her, much more
quickly than if you just punished or lectured her.
That’s what we explain when people ask about the demands of
connecting with children. Someone might say,
“That sounds like a
respectful and loving way to discipline, and I can see how it would
help my kids in the long run, and even make discipline easier down
the road. But come on! I’ve got a job! And other kids! And dinner
to make, and piano and ballet and Little League and a hundred
other things. I’m barely keeping my head above water as it is! How
am I supposed to ɹnd the extra time necessary to connect and
redirect when I discipline?”
We get it. We really do. Both of us work, our spouses work, and
we’re both committed parents. It’s not easy. But what we’ve
learned as we’ve practiced the principles and strategies we discuss
in the following chapters is that No-Drama Discipline isn’t some
sort of luxury available only to people with all kinds of extra time
on their hands. (We’re not sure that kind of parent actually exists.)
It’s not that the Whole-Brain approach requires that you carve out
tons of extra time to engage your kids in discussions about the right
way to do things. In fact, No-Drama Discipline is all about taking
ordinary, in-the-moment parenting situations and using them as
opportunities to reach your kids and teach them what’s important.
You might think that yelling “Knock it oʃ!” or “Quit whining!” or
giving an immediate time-out would be quicker, simpler, and more
eʃective than connecting with a child’s feelings. But as we’ll soon
explain, paying attention to your child’s emotions will usually lead
to greater calm and cooperation, and do so much more quickly,
than will a dramatic parental outburst that escalates the emotions
all around.
And here’s the best part. When we avoid bringing extra chaos
and drama to disciplinary situations—in other words, when we
combine clear and consistent limits with loving empathy—
everyone wins. Why? For one thing a No-Drama, Whole-Brain
approach makes life easier for both parents and kids. In high-stress
moments—for instance, when your child threatens to throw the TV
remote into the toilet mere seconds before the season ɹnale of
your beloved hospital drama—you can appeal to the higher,
thinking part of her brain, rather than triggering the lower, more
reactive part. (We explain this strategy in detail in Chapter 3.) As a
result, you’re going to be able to avoid most of the yelling and
crying and anger that discipline so often causes, not to mention
keeping the remote dry and getting you to your program long
before the first ambulance rolls onto your screen.
More important, connecting and redirecting will, to put it as
simply as possible, help your kids become better human beings,
both now and as they grow toward adulthood. It will build the
internal skills they’ll need throughout their lives. Not only will
they move from a reactive state to a receptive place where they
can actually learn—that’s the external, cooperation part—but
connections in their brain will be built as well. These connections
will allow them to grow more and more into people who know
how to control themselves, think about others, regulate their
emotions, and make good choices. You’ll be helping them build an
internal compass they can learn to rely on. Rather than simply
telling them what to do and demanding that they conform to your
requests, you’ll be giving them experiences that strengthen their
executive functions and develop skills related to empathy, personal
insight, and morality. That’s the internal, brain-building part.
The research is really clear on this point. Kids who achieve the
best outcomes in life—emotionally, relationally, and even
educationally—have parents who raise them with a high degree of
connection and nurturing, while also communicating and
maintaining clear limits and high expectations. Their parents
remain consistent while still interacting with them in a way that
communicates love, respect, and compassion. As a result, the kids
are happier, do better in school, get into less trouble, and enjoy
more meaningful relationships.
You won’t always be able to discipline in a way that both
connects and redirects. We don’t do it perfectly with our own kids,
either. But the more we connect and redirect, the less drama we
see when we respond to our kids’ misbehavior. Even better, they
learn more, they build better relationship and conɻict-resolution
skills, and they enjoy an even stronger relationship with us as they
grow and develop.
About the Book
What’s involved in creating a discipline strategy that’s high on
relationship and low on drama? That’s what the rest of the book
will explain. Chapter 1,
“ReTHINKING Discipline,
” poses some
questions about what discipline is, helping you identify and
develop your own discipline approach with these No-Drama
strategies in mind. Chapter 2,
“Your Brain on Discipline,
” discusses
the developing brain and its role in discipline. Chapter 3,
“From
Tantrum to Tranquility,
” will focus on the “connect” aspect of
discipline, emphasizing the importance of communicating that we
love and embrace our children for who they are, even in the midst
of a disciplinary moment. Chapter 4 stays with this theme, oʃering
speciɹc strategies and suggestions for connecting with kids so that
they can calm down enough to really hear us and learn, thus
making better decisions in both the short term and the long term.
Then it’s time to redirect, which is the focus of Chapter 5. The
emphasis will be on helping you remember the one deɹnition of
discipline (to teach), two key principles (wait until your child is
ready, and be consistent but not rigid), and three desired outcomes
(insight, empathy, and repair). Chapter 6 then concentrates on
speciɹc redirection strategies you can use for achieving the
immediate goal of eliciting cooperation in the moment, and for
teaching kids about personal insight, relational empathy, and
taking steps toward making good choices. The book’s concluding
chapter oʃers four messages of hope intended to help you take the
pressure oʃ yourself as you discipline. As we’ll explain, we all
mess up when we discipline. We’re all human. There is no such
thing as a “perfect parent.” But if we model how to deal with our
mistakes and then repair the relationship afterward, even our lessthan-perfect responses to misbehavior can be valuable and give
kids opportunities to deal with diɽcult situations and therefore
develop new skills. (Phew!) No-Drama Discipline isn’t about
perfection. It’s about personal connection and repairing ruptures
when they inevitably occur.
You’ll see that we’ve included a “Further Resources” section at
the back of the book. We hope this additional material will add to
your experience of reading the book and help you implement the
“connect and redirect” strategies in your own home. The ɹrst
document we call a “Refrigerator Sheet.” It contains the most
essential concepts from the book, presented so you can easily
remind yourself of the core No-Drama principles and strategies.
Feel free to copy this sheet and hang it on your refrigerator, tape it
to the dashboard of your car, or post it anywhere else it might be
helpful.
Next you’ll see a section called “When a Parenting Expert Loses
It,
” which tells stories of when we, Dan and Tina, have ɻipped our
lids and taken the low road in our own roles as parents, rather than
disciplining from a No-Drama, Whole-Brain approach. In sharing
these stories with you, we simply want to acknowledge that none
of us is perfect, and that all of us make mistakes with our kids. We
hope you’ll laugh along with us as you read, and not judge us too
harshly.
Next comes “A Note to Our Child’s Caregivers.” These pages are
just what you’d expect: a note you can give to the other people
who take care of your children. Most of us rely on grandparents,
babysitters, friends, and others to help us raise our kids. This note
lays out a brief and simple list of the key No-Drama principles. It’s
similar to the Refrigerator Sheet, but it’s written for someone who
has not read No-Drama Discipline. That way you don’t have to ask
your in-laws to buy and read the entire book (although nobody’s
stopping you from doing that if you want!).
After the note to caregivers, you’ll see a list called “Twenty
Discipline Mistakes Even Great Parents Make.” This is one more set
of reminders to help you think through the principles and issues we
raise in the coming chapters. The book then closes with an excerpt
from our earlier book, The Whole-Brain Child. By reading through
this excerpt, you can get a better idea of what we mean when we
talk about parenting from a Whole-Brain perspective. It’s not
necessary that you read this excerpt to understand what we present
here, but it’s there if you’d like to go deeper into these ideas and
learn other concepts and strategies for building your children’s
brains and leading them toward health, happiness, and resilience.
Our overall goal in this book is to deliver a message of hope that
will transform how people understand and practice discipline. One
of the typically least pleasant parts of working with children—
discipline—can actually be one of the most meaningful, and it
doesn’t have to be full of constant drama and reactivity for both
you and your child. Children’s misbehavior really can be
transformed into better connections both in your relationship and
within your child’s brain. Disciplining from a Whole-Brain
perspective will allow you to completely shift the way you think
about your interactions with your children when they misbehave,
and recognize those moments as opportunities to build skills that
will help them now and into adulthood, not to mention making life
easier and more enjoyable for everyone in the family.
H
CHAPTER 1
ReTHINKING Discipline
ere are some actual statements we’ve heard from parents
we’ve worked with. Do any of them resonate with you?


Do these comments sound familiar? So many parents feel like
this. They want to handle things well when their kids are struggling
to do the right thing, but more often than not, they end up simply
reacting to a situation, rather than working from a clear set of
principles and strategies. They shift into autopilot and give up
control of their more intentional parenting decisions.
Autopilot may be a great tool when you’re ɻying a plane. Just
ɻip the switch, sit back and relax, and let the computer take you
where it’s been preprogrammed to go. But when it comes to
disciplining children, working from a preprogrammed autopilot
isn’t so great. It can ɻy us straight into whatever dark and stormy
cloud bank is looming, meaning parents and kids alike are in for a
bumpy ride.
Instead of being reactive, we want to be responsive to our kids.
We want to be intentional and make conscious decisions based on
principles we’ve thought about and agreed on beforehand. Being
intentional means considering various options and then choosing
the one that engages a thoughtful approach toward our intended
outcomes. For No-Drama Discipline, this means the short-term
external outcome of behavioral boundaries and structure and the
long-term internal outcome of teaching life skills.
Let’s say, for example, your four-year-old hits you. Maybe he’s
angry because you told him you needed to ɹnish an email before
you could play Legos with him, and he responded by slapping you
on the back. (It’s always surprising, isn’t it, that a person that small
can inflict so much pain?)
What do you do? If you’re on autopilot, not working from a
speciɹc philosophy for how to handle misbehavior, you might
simply react immediately without much reɻection or intention.
Maybe you’d grab him, possibly harder than you should, and tell
him through clenched teeth,
“Hitting is not OK!” Then you might
give him some sort of consequence, maybe marching him to his
room for a time-out.
Is this the worst possible parental reaction? No, it’s not. But
could it be better? Deɹnitely. What’s needed is a clear understanding
of what you actually want to accomplish when your child misbehaves.
That’s the overall goal of this chapter, to help you understand
the importance of working from an intentional philosophy and
having a clear and consistent strategy for responding to
misbehavior. As we said in the introduction, the dual goals of
discipline are to promote good external behavior in the short term
and build the internal structure of the brain for better behavior and
relationship skills in the long term. Keep in mind that discipline is
ultimately about teaching. So when you clench your teeth, spit out
a rule, and give a consequence, is that going to be eʃective in
teaching your child about hitting?
Well, yes and no. It might achieve the short-term eʃect of getting
him not to hit you. Fear and punishment can be eʃective in the
moment, but they don’t work over the long term. And are fear,
punishment, and drama really what we want to use as primary
motivators of our children? If so, we teach that power and control
are the best tools to get others to do what we want them to do.
Again, it’s completely normal to just react when we get angry,
especially when someone inɻicts physical or emotional pain on us.
But there are better responses, responses that can achieve the same
short-term goal of reducing the likelihood of the unwanted
behavior in the future, while also building skills. So rather than just
fearing your response and inhibiting an impulse in the future, your
child will undergo a learning experience that creates an internal
skill beyond simply an association of fear. And all of this learning
can occur while reducing the drama in the interaction and
strengthening your connection with your child.
Let’s talk about how you can respond to make discipline less of a
fear-creating reaction and more of a skill-building response on your
part.
The Three Questions: Why? What? How?
Before you respond to misbehavior, take a moment to ask yourself
three simple questions:
1. Why did my child act this way? In our anger, our answer might be
“Because he’s a spoiled brat” or “Because he’s trying to push my
buttons!” But when we approach with curiosity instead of
assumptions, looking deeper at what’s going on behind a
particular misbehavior, we can often understand that our child
was trying to express or attempt something but simply didn’t
handle it appropriately. If we understand this, we ourselves can
respond more effectively—and compassionately.
2. What lesson do I want to teach in this moment? Again, the goal of
discipline isn’t to give a consequence. We want to teach a lesson
—whether it’s about self-control, the importance of sharing,
acting responsibly, or anything else.
3. How can I best teach this lesson? Considering a child’s age and
developmental stage, along with the context of the situation (did
he realize the bullhorn was switched on before he raised it to the
dog’s ear?), how can we most eʃectively communicate what we
want to get across? Too often, we respond to misbehavior as if
consequences were the goal of discipline. Sometimes natural
consequences result from a child’s decision, and the lesson is
taught without our needing to do much. But there are usually
more eʃective and loving ways to help our kids understand what
we’re trying to communicate than to immediately hand out onesize-fits-all consequences.
By asking ourselves these three questions—why, what, and how
—when our children do something we don’t like, we can more
easily shift out of autopilot mode. That means we’ll be much more
likely to respond in a way that’s eʃective in stopping the behavior
in the short term while also teaching bigger, long-lasting life
lessons and skills that build character and prepare kids for making
good decisions in the future.
Let’s look more closely at how these three questions might help
us respond to the four-year-old who slaps you while you’re
emailing. When you hear the smack and feel the tiny, hand-shaped
imprint of pain on your back, it may take you a moment to calm
down and avoid simply reacting. It’s not always easy, is it? In fact,
our brains are programmed to interpret physical pain as a threat,
which activates the neural circuitry that can make us more reactive
and put us in a “ɹght” mode. So it takes some eʃort, sometimes
intense eʃort, to maintain control and practice No-Drama
Discipline. We have to override our primitive reactive brain when
this happens. Not easy. (By the way, this gets much harder to do if
we’re sleep deprived, hungry, overwhelmed, or not prioritizing
self-care.) This pause between reactive and responsive is the
beginning of choice, intention, and skillfulness as a parent.
So as quickly as possible, you want to try to pause and ask
yourself the three questions. Then you can see much more clearly
what’s going on in your interaction with your child. Every situation
is diʃerent and depends on many diʃerent factors, but the answers
to the questions might look something like this:
1. Why did my child act this way? He hit you because he wanted
your attention and wasn’t getting it. Sounds pretty typical for a
four-year-old, doesn’t it? Desirable? No. Developmentally
appropriate? Absolutely. It’s hard for a child this age to wait, and
big feelings surfaced, making it even harder. He’s not yet old
enough to consistently calm himself eʃectively or quickly
enough to prevent acting out. You wish he’d just soothe himself
and with composure declare,
“Mom, I’m feeling frustrated that
you’re asking me to keep waiting, and I’m having a strong,
aggressive impulse to hit you right now—but I have chosen not
to and am using my words instead.” But that’s not going to
happen. (It would be pretty funny if it did.) In that moment,
hitting is your son’s default strategy for expressing his big
feelings of frustration and impatience, and he needs some time
and skill-building practice to learn how to handle both delaying
gratification and appropriately managing anger. That’s why he hit
you.
That feels much less personal, doesn’t it? Our kids don’t usually
lash out at us because they’re simply rude, or because we’re failures
as parents. They usually lash out because they don’t yet have the
capacity to regulate their emotional states and control their impulses.
And they feel safe enough with us to know that they won’t lose
our love, even when they’re at their worst. In fact, when a fouryear-old doesn’t hit and acts “perfect” all the time, we have
concerns about the child’s bond with his parent. When children
are securely attached to their parents, they feel safe enough to
test that relationship. In other words, your child’s misbehavior is
often a sign of his trust and safety with you. Many parents notice
that their children “save it all up for them,
” behaving much
better at school or with other adults than they do at home. This
is why. These ɻare-ups are often signs of safety and trust, rather
than just some form of rebellion.
2. What lesson do I want to teach in this moment? The lesson is not
that misbehavior merits a consequence, but that there are better
ways of getting your attention and managing his anger than
resorting to violence. You want him to learn that hitting isn’t
OK, and that there are lots of appropriate ways to express his big
feelings.
3. How can I best teach this lesson? While giving him a time-out or
some other unrelated consequence might or might not make your
son think twice next time about hitting, there’s a better
alternative. What if you connected with him by pulling him to
you and letting him know he has your full attention? Then you
could acknowledge his feelings and model how to communicate
those emotions: “It’s hard to wait. You really want me to play,
and you’re mad that I’m at the computer. Is that right?” Most
likely you’ll receive an angry “Yes!” in response. That’s not a bad
thing; he’ll know he has your attention. And you’ll have his, too.
You can now talk with him and, as he becomes calmer and better
able to listen, get eye contact, explain that hitting is never all
right, and talk about some alternatives he could choose—like
using his words to express his frustration—the next time he
wants your attention.
This approach works with older kids as well. Let’s look at one of
the most common issues faced by parents everywhere: homework
battles. Imagine that your nine-year-old is seriously struggling
when it’s time to study, and you two are going round and round on
a regular basis. At least once a week she melts down. She gets so
frustrated she ends up in tears, yelling at you and calling her
teachers “mean” for assigning such diɽcult homework and herself
“stupid” for having trouble. After these proclamations she buries
her face in the crook of her arm and collapses in a puddle of tears
on the table.
For a parent, this situation can be every bit as maddening as
being slapped on the back by a four-year-old. An autopilot response
would be to give in to the frustration and, in the heat of anger,
argue with your daughter and lecture her, blaming her for
managing her time poorly and not listening well enough during
class. You’re probably familiar with the “If you had started earlier,
when I asked you to, you’d be done by now” lecture. We’ve never
heard of a kid responding to that lecture with “You’re right, Dad. I
really should have started when you asked. I’ll take responsibility
for not beginning when I was supposed to, and I’ve learned my
lesson. I’ll just jump right on my homework earlier tomorrow.
Thanks for enlightening me on this.”
Instead of the lecture, what if you asked the why-what-how
questions?
1. Why did my child act this way? Again, disciplinary approaches are
going to change depending on who your child is and what her
personality is like. Maybe homework is a struggle for her and
she feels frustrated, like it’s a battle she can never win. Maybe
there’s something about it that feels too hard or overwhelming
and makes her feel bad about herself, or maybe she’s just
needing more physical activity. The main feelings here could be
frustration and helplessness.
Or maybe school isn’t usually that tough for her, but she
melted down because she’s tired and feeling overwhelmed today.
She got up early, went to school for six hours, then had a Girl
Scouts meeting that lasted right up to dinnertime. Now that she’s
eaten, she’s supposed to sit at the kitchen table and work on
fractions for forty-ɹve minutes? No wonder she’s freaking out a
bit. That’s a lot to ask of a nine-year-old (or even an adult!).
That doesn’t mean she doesn’t still need to do her homework,
but it can change your perspective—and your response—when
you realize where she’s coming from.
2. What lesson do I want to teach in this moment? It might be that
you want to teach about eʃective time management and
responsibility. Or about making choices regarding which
activities to participate in. Or about how to handle frustration
more adaptively.
3. How can I best teach this lesson? However you answer question 2,
a lecture when she’s already upset deɹnitely isn’t the best
approach. This isn’t a teachable moment, because the emotional,
reactive parts of her brain are raging, overwhelming the more
calm, rational, thinking, and receptive parts of her brain. So
instead, you might want to help her with her fractions and just
get through this particular crisis: “I know it’s a lot tonight and
you’re tired. You can do this. I’ll sit with you and we’ll knock it
out.” Then once she’s calmed down and you two are sharing a
bowl of ice cream—or maybe even the next day—you can
discuss whether she’s overscheduled, or consider that she’s really
struggling to understand a concept, or explore the possibility that
she’s talking with friends in class and bringing home unɹnished
classwork, meaning she ends up with more homework. Ask her
questions, and problem-solve together to ɹgure out what’s going
on. Ask what’s getting in the way of completing her homework,
why she thinks it’s not working well, and what her suggestions
would be. Look at the whole experience as an opportunity to
collaborate on improving the homework experience. She might
need some help building skills for coming up with solutions, but
involve her in the process as much as possible.
Remember to pick a time when you’re both in a good,
receptive state of mind, then begin by saying something like,
“The homework situation isn’t working very well, is it? I bet we
can ɹnd a better way. What do you think might work?” (By the
way, we’ll give you lots of speciɹc, practical suggestions to help
with this type of conversation in Chapter 6, where we discuss
No-Drama redirection strategies.)
Diʃerent kids will require diʃerent responses to the why-whathow questions, so we’re not saying that any of these speciɹc
answers will necessarily apply to your children at a given time. The
point is to look at discipline in a new way, to rethink it. Then you
can be guided by an overall philosophy when you interact with
your kids, rather than simply reacting with whatever pops out
when your kids do something you don’t like. Why-what-how
questions give us a new way of moving from reactive parenting to
receptive and intentional Whole-Brain parenting strategies.
Granted, you won’t always have time to think through the three
questions. When good-natured wrestling in the living room turns
into a bloody cage match, or when you have young twins who are
already late for ballet, it’s not that easy to go through a threequestion protocol. We get it. It may sound completely unrealistic
that you’d have time to be this mindful in the heat of the moment.

We’re not saying you’ll do it perfectly every time, or that you’ll
immediately be able to think through your response when your
kids get upset. But the more you consider and practice this
approach, the more natural and automatic it will become to oʃer a
quick assessment and respond with an intentional response. It can
even become your default, your go-to. With practice, these
questions can help you remain intentional and receptive in the face
of previously reaction-inducing interactions. Asking why, what, and
how can help create an internal sense of clarity even in the face of
external chaos.
As a result, you’ll receive the bonus of having to discipline less
and less, because not only will you be shaping your child’s brain so
that he makes better decisions and learns the connection between
his feelings and his behavior, but you’ll be more attuned to what’s
happening with him—why he does what he does—meaning that
you’ll be better able to guide him before things escalate. Plus,
you’ll be more able to see things from his perspective, which will
let you recognize when he needs your help, rather than your wrath.
Can’t vs. Won’t: Discipline Isn’t One-Size-Fits-All
To put it simply, asking the why-what-how questions helps us
remember who our kids are and what they need. The questions
challenge us to be conscious of the age and unique needs of each
individual. After all, what works for one child may be the exact
opposite of what her brother needs. And what works for one child
one minute might not work for the same child ten minutes later. So
don’t think of discipline as a one-size-ɹts-all solution. Instead,
remember how important it is to discipline this one child in this one
moment.
Too often, when we discipline on autopilot, we respond to a
situation much more from our general state of mind than from
what our child needs at that particular time. It’s easy to forget that
our children are just that—children—and to expect behavior
beyond their developmental capacity. For example, we can’t expect
a four-year-old to handle his emotions well when he’s angry that
his mom is still on the computer, any more than we can expect a
nine-year-old not to freak out about homework from time to time.
Tina recently saw a mother and grandmother shopping. They had
buckled a little boy, who looked about ɹfteen months old, into
their cart. As the women browsed, looking at purses and shoes, the
boy cried and cried, clearly wanting to get out of the cart. He
needed to move and walk and explore. The caregivers
absentmindedly handed him items to distract him, which just
frustrated him more. This little boy couldn’t talk, but his message
was clear: “You’re asking way too much of me! I need you to see
what I need!” His behavior and emotional wails were completely
understandable.
In fact, we should assume that kids will sometimes experience
and display emotional reactivity, as well as “oppositional”
behavior. Developmentally, they’re not working from fully formed
brains yet (as we’ll explain in Chapter 2), so they are literally
incapable of meeting our expectations all of the time. That means
t h a t when we discipline, we must always consider a child’s
developmental capacity, particular temperament, and emotional style,
as well as the situational context.
A valuable distinction is the idea of can’t vs. won’t. Parental
frustration radically and drastically decreases when we distinguish
between a can’t and a won’t. Sometimes we assume that our kids
won’t behave the way we want them to, when in reality, they
simply can’t, at least not in this particular moment.
The truth is that a huge percentage of misbehavior is more about
can’t than won’t. The next time your child is having a hard time
managing herself, ask yourself,
“Does the way she’s acting make
sense, considering her age and the circumstances?” Much more
often than not, the answer will be yes. Run errands for hours with
a three-year-old in the car, and she’s going to get fussy. An elevenyear-old who stayed out late watching ɹreworks the previous night
and then had to get up early for a student council car wash the next
morning is likely to melt down sometime during the day. Not
because he won’t keep it together, but because he can’t.
We make this point to parents all the time. It was especially
eʃective with one single father who visited Tina in her oɽce. He
was at his wits’ end because his ɹve-year-old clearly demonstrated
the ability to act appropriately and make good decisions. But at
times, his son would melt down over the smallest thing. Here’s
how Tina approached the conversation.
I began by trying to explain to this dad that at times his
s o n couldn’t regulate himself, which meant that he
wasn’t choosing to be willful or deɹant. The father’s
body language in response to my explanation was clear.
He crossed his arms and leaned back in his chair.
Although he didn’t literally roll his eyes, it was clear he
wasn’t about to start a Tina Bryson fan club. So I said,
“I’m getting the sense you don’t agree with me here.”
He responded,
“It just doesn’t make sense. Sometimes
he’s great about handling even big disappointments.
Like last week when he didn’t get to go to the hockey
game. Then other times he’ll completely lose his mind
because he can’t have the blue cup because it’s in the
dishwasher! It’s not about what he can’t do. He’s just
spoiled and needs stricter discipline. He needs to learn
how to obey. And he can! He’s already proven he can
totally choose how to handle himself.”
I decided to take a therapeutic risk—doing something
out of the ordinary without knowing quite how it would
go. I nodded, then asked,
“I bet you’re a loving and
patient dad most of the time, right?”
He replied,
“Yes, most of the time. Sometimes, of
course, I’m not.”
I tried to communicate some humor and playfulness
in my tone as I said,
“So you can be patient and loving,
but sometimes you’re choosing not to be?” Fortunately,
he smiled, beginning to see where I was going. So I
pressed on. “If you loved your son, wouldn’t you make
better choices and be a good dad all of the time? Why
are you choosing to be impatient or reactive?” He began
to nod and broke out in an even bigger smile,
acknowledging my playfulness as the point sank in.
I continued. “What is it that makes it hard to be
patient?”
He said,
“Well, it depends on how I’m feeling, like if
I’m tired or I’ve had a rough day at work or something.”
I smiled and said,
“You know where I’m going with
this, don’t you?”
Of course he did. Tina went on to explain that a person’s
capacity to handle situations well and make good decisions can
really ɻuctuate according to the circumstances and the context of a
given situation. Simply because we’re human, our capacity to
handle ourselves well is not stable and constant. And that’s
certainly the case with a five-year-old.
The father clearly understood what Tina was saying: that it’s
misguided to assume that just because his son could handle himself
well in one moment, he’d always be able to do so. And that when
his son didn’t manage his feelings and behaviors, it wasn’t evidence
that he was spoiled and needed stricter discipline. Rather, he
needed understanding and help, and through emotional connection
and setting limits, the father could increase and expand his son’s
capacity. The truth is that for all of us, our capacity ɻuctuates given
our state of mind and state of body, and these states are inɻuenced by
so many factors—especially in the case of a developing brain in a
developing child.
Tina and the father talked further, and it was clear that he had
fully understood Tina’s point. He got the diʃerence between can’t
and won’t, and he saw that he was imposing rigid and
developmentally inappropriate (one-size-ɹts-all) expectations on
his young son, as well as on the boy’s sister. This new perspective
empowered him to switch oʃ his parental autopilot and start
working on making intentional, moment-by-moment decisions with
his children, both of whom had their own particular personality
and needs at diʃerent moments. The father realized that not only
could he still set clear, ɹrm boundaries, but he could do so even more
eʃectively and respectfully, because he was taking into account each
child’s individual temperament and ɻuctuating capacity, along with the
context of each situation. As a result, he’d be able to achieve both
disciplinary goals: to see less overall uncooperativeness from his
son, and to teach him important skills and life lessons that would
help him as he grew into a man.
This father was learning to challenge certain assumptions in his
own thinking, such as that misbehavior is always willful opposition
instead of a moment of diɽculty while trying to manage feelings
and behaviors. Future conversations with Tina led him to question
not only this assumption, but also his emphasis on having his son
and daughter obey him unconditionally and without exception. Yes,
he reasonably and justiɹably wanted his discipline to encourage
cooperation from his children. But complete and unquestioning
obedience? Did he want his kids to grow up blindly obeying
everyone their whole lives? Or would he rather have them develop
their own individual personalities and identities, learning along the
way what it means to get along with others, observe limits, make
good decisions, be self-disciplined, and navigate diɽcult situations
by thinking for themselves? Again, he got the point, and it made all
the difference for his children.
One other assumption this father began to challenge within
himself was that there’s some silver bullet or magic wand that can
be used to address any behavioral issue or concern. We wish there
were such a cure-all, but there’s not. It’s tempting to buy into one
discipline practice that promises to work all the time and in every
situation or to radically change a kid in a few days. But the
dynamics of interacting with children are always much more
complex than that. Behavioral issues simply can’t be resolved with
a one-size-ɹts-all approach that we apply to every circumstance or
environment or child.
Let’s take a few minutes now and discuss the two most common
one-size-ɹts-all disciplinary techniques that parents rely on:
spanking and time-outs.
Spanking and the Brain
One autopilot response that a number of parents resort to is
spanking. We often get asked where we stand on the subject.
Although we’re really big advocates for boundaries and limits,
we are both strongly against spanking. Physical punishment is a
complex and highly charged topic, and a full discussion of the
research, the various contexts in which physical punishment takes
place, and the negative impacts of spanking is beyond the scope of
this book. But based on our neuroscientiɹc perspective and review
of the research literature, we believe that spanking is likely to be
counterproductive when it comes to building respectful
relationships with our children, teaching kids the lessons we want
them to learn, and encouraging optimal development. We also
believe that children should have the right to be free from any
form of violence, especially at the hands of the people they trust
most to protect them.
We know there are all kinds of parents, all kinds of kids, and all
kinds of contexts in which discipline takes place. And we certainly
understand that frustration, along with the desire to do the right
thing for their children, leads some parents to use spanking as a
discipline strategy. But the research consistently demonstrates that
even when parents are warm, loving, and nurturing, not only is
spanking children less eʃective in changing behavior in the long
run, it’s associated with negative outcomes in many domains.
Granted, there are plenty of non-spanking discipline approaches
that can be just as damaging as spanking. Isolating children for long
periods of time, humiliating them, terrifying them by screaming
threats, and using other forms of verbal or psychological aggression
are all examples of disciplinary practices that wound children’s
minds even when their parents never physically touch them.
We therefore encourage parents to avoid any discipline approach
that is aggressive, inɻicts pain, or creates fear or terror. For one
thing, it’s counterproductive. The child’s attention shifts from her
own behavior and how to modify it, to the caregiver’s response to
the behavior, meaning that the child no longer considers her own
actions at all. Instead, she thinks only about how unfair and mean
her parent was to hurt her—or even how scary her parent was in
that moment. The parental response, then, undermines both of the
primary goals of discipline—changing behavior and building the brain—
because it sidesteps an opportunity for the child to think about her own
behavior and even feel some healthy guilt or remorse.
Another important problem with spanking is what happens to the
child physiologically and neurologically. The brain interprets pain
as a threat. So when a parent inɻicts physical pain on a child, that
child faces an unsolvable biological paradox. On one hand, we’re
all born with an instinct to go toward our caregivers for protection
when we’re hurt or afraid. But when our caregivers are also the
source of the pain and fear, when the parent has caused the state of
terror inside the child by what he or she has done, it can be very
confusing for the child’s brain. One circuit drives the child to try to
escape the parent who is inɻicting pain; another circuit drives the
child toward the attachment ɹgure for safety. So when the parent is
the source of fear or pain, the brain can become disorganized in its
functioning, as there is no solution. We call this at the extreme a
form of disorganized attachment. The stress hormone cortisol,
released with such a disorganized internal state and repeated
interpersonal experiences of rage and terror, can lead to longlasting negative impacts on the brain’s development, as cortisol is
toxic to the brain and inhibits healthy growth. Harsh and severe
punishment can actually lead to signiɹcant changes in the brain,
such as the death of brain connections and even brain cells.
Another problem with spanking is that it teaches the child that
the parent has no eʃective strategy short of inɻicting bodily pain.
That’s a direct lesson every parent should consider quite deeply: do
we want to teach our kids that the way to resolve a conɻict is to
inɻict physical pain, particularly on someone who is defenseless
and cannot fight back?
Looking through the lens of the brain and body, we know that
humans are instinctually wired to avoid pain. And it is also the
same part of the brain that mediates physical pain that processes
social rejection. Inɻicting physical pain is also creating social
rejection in the child’s brain. Since children can’t be perfect, we see
the importance of the ɹndings indicating that while spanking often
stops a behavior in a particular moment, it’s not as eʃective at
changing behavior in the long run. Instead, children will often just
get better at concealing what they’ve done. In other words, the
danger is that kids will do whatever it takes to avoid the pain of
physical punishment (and social rejection), which will often mean
more lying and hiding—not collaboratively communicating and
being open to learning.
One ɹnal point about spanking has to do with which part of the
brain we want to appeal to and develop with our discipline. As
we’ll explain in the next chapter, parents have the option of
engaging the higher, thinking part of the child’s wise brain, or the
lower, more reactive, reptilian part. If you threaten or physically
attack a reptile, what kind of a response do you think you’ll get?
Imagine a cornered cobra, spitting at you. There is nothing wise or
connecting about being reactive.
When we are threatened or physically attacked, our reptilian or
primitive brain takes over. We move into an adaptive survival
mode, often called “ɹght, ɻight, or freeze.” We can also faint, a
response that occurs in some when they feel totally helpless.
Likewise, when we cause our kids to experience fear, pain, and
anger, we activate an increase in the ɻow of energy and
information to the primitive, reactive brain, instead of directing
the ɻow to the receptive, thinking, more sophisticated and
potentially wise regions of the brain that allow kids to make
healthy and flexible choices and handle their emotions well.
Do you want to trigger reactivity in your child’s primitive brain,
or engage her thinking, rational brain in being receptive and openly
engaged with the world? When we activate the reactive states of
the brain, we miss the chance to develop the thinking part of the
brain. It’s a lost opportunity. What’s more, we have so many other,
more eʃective options for disciplining our kids—strategies that
give children practice using their “upstairs brain” so that it’s
stronger and further developed, meaning that they’re much better
able to be responsible people who do the right thing more often
than not. (Much more about that in Chapters 3–6.)
What About Time-outs? Aren’t They an Effective Discipline Tool?
These days, most parents who have decided they don’t want to
spank their kids assume that time-outs are the best available
option. But are they? Do they help us achieve our discipline goals?
In general terms, we don’t think so.
We know lots of loving parents who use time-outs as their
primary discipline technique. But after exploring the research,
talking to thousands of parents, and raising our own kids, we’ve
come up with several main reasons we do not think that time-outs
are the best discipline strategy. For one thing, when parents use
time-outs, they often use them a lot, and out of anger. But parents
can give children more positive and meaningful experiences that
better achieve our dual goals of encouraging cooperation and
building the brain. As we’ll explain in more detail in the next
chapter, brain connections are formed from repeated experiences.
And what experience does a time-out give a child? Isolation. Even
if you can oʃer a time-out in a loving manner, do you want your
child’s repeated experiences when she makes a mistake to be time
by herself, which is often experienced, particularly by young
children, as rejection?
Wouldn’t it be better to have her experience what it means to do
things the right way? So instead of a time-out, you might ask her to
practice handling a situation diʃerently. If she’s being disrespectful
in her tone or words, you can have her try it again and
communicate what she’s saying respectfully. If she’s been mean to
her brother, you might ask her to ɹnd three kind things to do for
him before bedtime. That way, the repeated experience of positive
behavior begins to get wired into her brain. (Again, we’ll cover this
in more depth in the following chapters.)
In short, time-outs often fail to accomplish their objective, which
is supposed to be for children to calm down and reɻect on their
behavior. In our experience, time-outs frequently just make
children angrier and more dysregulated, leaving them even less
able to control themselves or think about what they’ve done. Plus,
how often do you think kids use their time-out to reɻect on their
behavior? We’ve got news for you: the main thing kids reɻect on
while in time-out is how mean their parents are to have put them
there.
When children are reflecting on their horrible luck to have such a
mean, unfair mom or dad, they’re missing out on an opportunity to
build insight, empathy, and problem-solving skills. Putting them in
time-out deprives them of a chance to practice being active,
empathic decision makers who are empowered to ɹgure things out.
We want to give them opportunities to be problem solvers, to
make good choices, and to be comforted when they are falling
apart. You can do your kids a lot of good simply by asking,
“What
are some ideas you have to make it better and solve this problem?”
Given the chance once they’re calm, kids will usually do the right
thing, and learn in the process.
In addition, too often time-outs aren’t directly and logically
linked to a particular behavior, which is a key to eʃective learning.
Making a toilet-paper mountain means helping clean up. Riding a
bike without a helmet means that rather than simply jumping on
the bike and riding, for two weeks there will be a required safety
check anytime the bicycle comes out of the garage. Leaving a bat at
baseball practice means having to borrow a teammate’s bat until
the other one turns up. Those are connected parental responses that
are clearly linked to the behavior. They aren’t punitive or
retaliatory in any way. They are focused on teaching kids lessons
and helping them understand about making things right. Time-outs,
though, often don’t relate in any clear way to a child’s poor
decision or out-of-control reaction. As a result, they’re often not as
effective in terms of changing behavior.
Even when parents have good intentions, time-outs are often
used inappropriately. We might want time-outs to give kids a
chance to calm down and pull themselves together so they can
move out of their internal chaos into calm and cooperation. But
much of the time, parents use time-outs punitively, where the goal
isn’t to help the child return to his calm baseline or to learn an
important lesson, but to punish him for some misbehavior. The
calming, teaching aspect of the time-out gets totally lost.
But the biggest reason we question the value of time-outs has to
do with a child’s profound need for connection. Often, misbehavior
is a result of a child getting overtaxed emotionally, so the
expression of a need or a big feeling comes out in ways that are
aggressive, disrespectful, or uncooperative. She may be hungry or
tired, or maybe there’s some other reason she’s incapable in that
moment of self-control and making a good decision. Maybe the
explanation is simply that she’s three, and her brain isn’t
sophisticated enough to understand and calmly express her feelings.
So instead of doing her best to convey her crushing disappointment
and anger that there’s no grape juice left, she begins throwing toys
at you.

It’s during these times that a child most needs our comfort and
calm presence. Forcing her to go oʃ and sit by herself can feel like
abandonment to a child, especially if she’s feeling out of control
already. It may even send the subtle message that when she isn’t
“doing the right thing” you don’t want to be near her. You don’t
want to send the message that you’ll be in relationship with her when
she’s “good” or happy, but you’ll withhold your love and aʃection when
she’s not. Would you want to stay in that kind of a relationship?
Wouldn’t we suggest to our teenagers that they might think about
avoiding friends or partners who treat them like that when they’ve
made a mistake?
We’re not saying that short time-outs are the worst possible
discipline technique, that they cause trauma, or that there’s never
an instance to use them. If done appropriately with loving
connection, such as sitting with the child and talking or comforting
—what can be called a “time-in”—some time to calm down can be
helpful for children. In fact, teaching kids how to pause and take
some inner reɻection time, some time-in, is essential for building
executive functions that reduce impulsivity and harness the power
of focused attention. But such reɻection is created in relationship,
not in complete isolation, especially for younger children. As
children get older, they can beneɹt from inner reɻection, from
time-in, to focus their attention on their inner world. This is how
they learn to “see the sea inside” and develop the skill to calm the
storms inside. Such time-in is the basis of mindsight, of seeing one’s
own mind and the mind of others with insight and empathy. And
mindsight includes the process of integration that enables inner
states to be changed, to move from chaos or rigidity to an inner
state of harmony and ɻexibility. Mindsight—insight, empathy, and
integration—is the basis of social and emotional intelligence, so
using time-in to develop inner reɻective skills is how we help
children and adolescents build the circuitry of such important
abilities. No-Drama Discipline would use a time-in to stop behavior
(the ɹrst goal) and to invite inner reɻection that builds executive
skills (our second goal).
One proactive strategy that can be eʃective is to help the child
create a “calm zone” with toys, books, or a favorite stuʃed animal,
which she visits when she needs the time and place to calm down.
That’s internal self-regulation, a fundamental skill of executive
function. (This is a good idea for parents, too! Maybe some
chocolate, magazines, music, red wine …) It’s not about
punishment or making a child pay for her mistake. It’s about
oʃering a choice and a place that helps the child self-regulate and
down-regulate, which involves downshifting out of her emotional
overload.
As you’ll see in the coming pages, there are dozens of other,
more nurturing, relationship-building, and effective ways to respond
to kids than to automatically give them a time-out as a one-sizeɹts-all default consequence for any misbehavior. The same goes for
spanking, and even for giving consequences in general. Fortunately,
as we’ll soon explain, there are better alternatives than to spank,
give a time-out, or automatically take away a toy or a privilege.
Alternatives that are logically and naturally linked to the child’s
behavior, that build the brain, and that maintain a strong
connection between parent and child.
What Is Your Discipline Philosophy?
The main point we’ve communicated in this chapter is that parents
need to be intentional about how they respond when their kids
misbehave. Rather than dramatically or emotionally reacting, or
responding to every infraction with a one-size-ɹts-all strategy that
ignores the context of the situation or a child’s developmental
stage, parents can work from principles and strategies that both
match their belief system and respect their children as the
individuals they are. No-Drama Discipline focuses not only on
addressing immediate circumstances and short-term behavior, but
also on building skills and creating connections in the brain that, in
the long run, will help children make thoughtful choices and handle
their emotions well automatically, meaning that discipline will be
needed less and less.
How are you doing on this? How intentional are you when you
discipline your children?
Take a moment right now and think about your normal response
to your kids’ behavior. Do you automatically spank, give a timeout, or yell? Do you have some other immediate go- to for when
your kids act out? Maybe you simply do what your parents did—or
just the opposite. The real question is, how much of your
disciplinary strategy comes from an intentional and consistent
approach, as opposed to simply reacting or relying on old habits
and default mechanisms?
Here are some questions to ask yourself as you think about your
overall discipline philosophy:
1. Do I have a discipline philosophy? How purposeful and consistent
am I when I don’t like how my kids are behaving?
2. Is what I’m doing working? Does my approach allow me to teach
my kids the lessons I want to teach, in terms of both immediate
behavior and how they grow and develop as human beings? And
am I ɹnding that I need to address behaviors less and less, or am
I having to discipline about the same behaviors over and over?
3. Do I feel good about what I’m doing? Does my discipline approach
help me enjoy my relationship with my children more? Do I
usually reɻect on discipline moments and feel pleased with how
I handled myself? Do I frequently wonder if there’s a better
way?
4. Do my kids feel good about it? Discipline is rarely going to be
popular, but do my children understand my approach and feel
my love? Am I communicating and modeling respect in a way
that allows them to still feel good about themselves?
5 . Do I feel good about the messages I’m communicating to my
children? Are there times I teach lessons I don’t want them to
internalize—for example, that obeying what I say is more
important than learning to make good decisions about doing the
right thing? Or that power and control are the best ways to get
people to do what we want? Or that I only want to be around
them if they’re pleasant?
6 . How much does my approach resemble that of my own parents?
How did my parents discipline me? Can I remember a speciɹc
experience of discipline and how it made me feel? Am I just
repeating old patterns? Rebelling against them?
7 . Does my approach ever lead to my kids apologizing in a sincere
manner? Even though this might not happen on a regular basis,
does my approach at least leave the door open for it?
8. Does it allow for me to take responsibility and apologize for my own
actions? How open am I with my kids about the fact that I make
mistakes? Am I willing to model for them what it means to own
up to one’s errors?
How do you feel right now, having asked yourself these
questions? Many parents experience regret, guilt, shame, or even
hopelessness when they acknowledge what has not been working
and worry that they may not have been doing the best they can.
But the truth is, you have done the best you can. If you could have
done better, you would have. As you learn new principles and
strategies, the goal is not to berate yourself for missed
opportunities, but to try to create new opportunities. When we
know better, we do better. There are things we, as experts, have
learned over the years that we wish we’d known or thought about
when our children were babies. Our children’s brains are extremely
plastic—they change their structure in response to experience—and
our children can respond very quickly and very productively to
new experiences. The more compassion you can have for yourself,
the more compassion you can have for your child. Even the best
parents realize that there will always be times they can be more
intentional, eʃective, and respectful regarding how they discipline
their children.
In the remaining chapters, our goal is to help you think about
what you want for your kids when it comes to guiding and teaching
them. None of us will ever be perfect. But we can take steps
toward modeling calm and self-control when our kids mess up. We
can ask the why-what-how questions. We can steer clear of onesize-ɹts-all disciplinary techniques. We can oʃer the two goals of
shaping external behaviors and learning internal skills. And we can
work on reducing the number of times we simply react (or
overreact) to a situation, and increasing the times we respond out
of a clear and receptive sense of what we believe our kids need—in
each particular moment, and as they move through childhood
toward adolescence and adulthood.

CHAPTER 2
Your Brain on Discipline
iz’s morning was going along ɹne. Both of her kids had eaten
breakfast, everyone was dressed, and she and her husband, Tim,
were heading out the door to take their daughters to their
respective schools. Then all of a sudden, when Liz uttered the most
seemingly trivial statement as she closed the front door behind her
—“Nina, you get in Daddy’s car, and Vera, you get in the van”—
everything fell apart.
Tim and their seven-year-old, Vera, had already started toward
the driveway, and Liz was locking the front door when a feral
scream from just behind her made her heart stop. She quickly
turned around to see Nina, her four-year-old, standing on the
bottom step of the porch, screaming “No!” in an astonishingly
earsplitting register.
Liz looked at Tim, then at Vera, both of whom shrugged, eyes
wide with confusion. Nina’s long, sustained “No!” had been
replaced by a staccato “No! No! No!” repeated, again, at full
volume. Liz quickly knelt and pulled Nina to her, her daughter’s
shrieks mercifully petering out and turning into sobs.
“Honey, what is it?” Liz asked. She was dumbfounded at this
outburst. “What is it?”
Nina continued to cry but was able to utter,
“You took Vera
yesterday!”
Liz again looked at Tim, who had walked toward them and
oʃered a puzzled “I have no idea” shrug. Liz, her ears still ringing,
tried to explain: “I know, sweetheart. That’s because Vera’s school
is right by my work.”
Nina pulled back from her mother and screamed,
“But it’s my
turn!”
Now that she knew her daughter wasn’t in danger, Liz took a
deep breath and brieɻy wondered what decibel level a high-pitched
scream would have to reach to actually break glass.
Vera, typically unsympathetic when it came to her sister’s
distress, impatiently announced,
“Mom, I’m gonna be late.”
Before we describe how Liz handled this classic parenting
situation, we need to introduce a few simple facts about the human
brain and the way it can impact our disciplinary decisions when
our kids misbehave or, as in this case, just lose control of
themselves. Let’s begin with three foundational discoveries about
the brain—we’ll call them the three “Brain C’s”—that can be
immensely beneɹcial when it comes to helping you discipline
eʃectively and with less drama, all while teaching your children
important lessons about self-control and relationships.
“Brain C” #1: The Brain Is Changing
The ɹrst Brain C—that the brain is changing—sounds simple, but
its implications are enormous and should inform just about
everything we do with our kids, including discipline.
A child’s brain is like a house that’s under construction. The
downstairs brain is made up of the brainstem and the limbic
region, which together form the lower sections of the brain, often
called the “reptilian brain” and the “old mammalian brain.” These
lower regions exist inside your skull from about the level of the
bridge of your nose down to the top of your neck, and some of it,
the brainstem, is well-developed at birth. We consider this
downstairs brain to be much more primitive, because it’s
responsible for our most fundamental neural and mental
operations: strong emotions; instincts like protecting our young;
and basic functions like breathing, regulating sleep and wake
cycles, and digestion. The downstairs brain is what causes a toddler
to throw a toy or bite someone when he doesn’t get his way. It can
be the source of our reactivity, and its motto is a rushed “Fire!
Ready! Aim!”—and often it skips the “ready” and “aim” parts
altogether. It was Nina’s downstairs brain that took over when she
was told her mom wouldn’t be driving her to school.
As you well know if you’re a parent, the downstairs brain, with
all of its primitive functions, is alive and well in even the youngest
children. The upstairs brain, though, which is responsible for more
sophisticated and complex thinking, is undeveloped at birth and
begins to grow during infancy and childhood. The upstairs brain is
made up of the cerebral cortex, which is the outermost layer of the
brain, and it resides directly behind your forehead and continues to
the back of your head like a half dome covering the downstairs
brain below it. Sometimes people refer to the cortex as the “outer
bark of the brain.” Unlike the primitive downstairs brain, with all
of its rudimentary functions, the upstairs brain is responsible for a
laundry list of thinking, emotional, and relational skills that allow
us to live balanced, meaningful lives and enjoy healthy
relationships:
• Sound decision making and planning
• Regulation of emotions and body
• Personal insight
• Flexibility and adaptability
• Empathy
• Morality
These are the very qualities we want to help instill in our children,
and they all require a well-developed upstairs brain.
The problem is that the upstairs brain takes time to develop. A
long time. We’re sorry to report—especially if today happens to be
the third time this week that your twelve-year-old left his
homework binder in his locker—that the upstairs brain actually
won’t be fully formed until a person reaches his mid-twenties. That
doesn’t mean there’s nothing for it to do along the way—it simply
means that while the child’s brain is being constructed, the
adolescent brain is in a period of remodeling itself and will be
changing the basic upstairs brain structures that were created in the
ɹrst dozen years of life. Dan explores all of this in his book for and
about adolescents called Brainstorm. The great news is that knowing
about the brain—for you and your child or adolescent—can change
the way each of you approaches learning and behaving. When we
know about the brain, we can guide our minds—how we pay
attention, how we think, how we feel, how we interact with others
—in ways that support solid, healthy brain development across the
life span.
Still, what this all means is that as much as we’d like for our kids
to consistently behave as if they were fully developed,
conscientious adults, with reliably functioning logic, emotional
balance, and morality, they just can’t yet when they are young. At
least not all the time. As a result, we have to proceed accordingly
and adjust our expectations. We want to turn to our nine-year-old
and ask, as we comfort our five-year-old whose eye has been struck
by a Nerf bullet ɹred at infuriatingly close range,
“What were you
thinking?”
His answer, of course, will be “I don’t know” or “I wasn’t
thinking.” And most likely he’ll be right. His upstairs brain wasn’t
engaged when he aimed at his sister’s pupil, just as her upstairs
brain wasn’t engaged yesterday when she demanded that her
cousin’s beach party be moved inside because she got a cut on her
heel and didn’t want to get sand in it. The bottom line is that no
matter how smart, responsible, or conscientious your child is, it’s
unfair to expect her to always handle herself well, or to always
distinguish between a good choice and a bad one. That’s even
impossible for adults to do all the time.
A good example of this gradual development can be found in a
particular area of the upstairs brain called the right temporal
parietal junction (TPJ).
The right TPJ plays a special role when it comes to helping us
understand what’s going on in the mind of another. When we view
a situation or a problem as someone else would, the right TPJ
becomes active and works with areas in the prefrontal cortex, just
behind the forehead, essentially to allow us to empathize with
another. These and other areas are part of what is called a
“mentalizing circuit” because they are involved in mindsight—that
is, seeing the mind of others, and even of ourselves! We can build
mindsight in our children as we guide them toward insight,
empathy, and moral thinking. Empathy, of course, aʃects our
moral and relational lives in signiɹcant and foundational ways.
We’re willing to cut someone some slack if she meant well when
she messed up. We’re willing to give someone the beneɹt of the
doubt if we trust his motives.
A child, though, who is still developing and whose upstairs brain
—which includes his right TPJ and prefrontal regions—is still
under construction, will often be unable to consider motives and
intention when he looks at a situation or problem. Ethical decisions
will be much more black and white, and concerns about issues like
justice and fairness will be much more clear-cut. Nina, for example,
had no interest in discussing contextual information about how
close her sister’s school was to her mom’s job. That logical, factual
bit of data was irrelevant to her. She cared only that her sister had
ridden with her mother yesterday, and fairness would dictate that
Nina should get to ride with her today. So for Liz to understand her
daughter’s point of view, she needed to realize that Nina was
viewing events through the lens of her still-growing upstairs brain,
which wasn’t always able to consider situational and contextual
information.
As we’ll explain in subsequent chapters, when we use our own
mindsight circuits to sense the mind behind our children’s behavior,
we model for them how to sense the mind within themselves and
others. Mindsight is a teachable skill at the heart of being empathic
and insightful, moral and compassionate. Mindsight is the basis of
social and emotional intelligence, and we can model this for our
children as we help guide the development of their changing
brains.
The point is that when we parent, and especially when we
discipline, we need to work hard to understand our children’s
points of view, their developmental stage, and what they are
ultimately capable of. This is how we use our own mindsight skills
to see the mind behind our children’s behavior. We don’t simply
react to their external actions, we tune in to the mind behind the
behavior. We also must remember that what they’re capable of
isn’t always the same; their capacity changes when they are feeling
tired, hungry, or overwhelmed. Comprehending this particular
Brain C, that the brain is changing and still developing, can move
us to a place where we can listen to our kids with more
understanding and compassion, and more fully understand why it is
that they’re upset and having a hard time managing themselves. It
is simply unfair to assume that our children are making decisions
using fully formed, perfectly functioning brains and can view the
world as we do.
Think about the list of functions the upstairs brain is responsible
for. Is that a realistic description of any child’s character? Of course
we’d love to see our kids demonstrate these qualities each and
every moment of their lives. Who wouldn’t want a child who plans
ahead and consistently makes good decisions, controls his emotions
and body, displays ɻexibility and empathy and self-understanding,
and acts out of a well-developed sense of morality? But it’s just not
going to happen. At least not all the time. Depending on the child
and the age, maybe not even frequently.
So is this an excuse for bad behavior? Do we need to simply turn
a blind eye when our kids misbehave? Certainly not. In fact, a
child’s developing brain is simply another reason we need to set
clear boundaries and help her understand what’s acceptable. The
fact that she doesn’t have a consistently working upstairs brain,
which provides internal constraints that govern her behavior, means
that she needs to be provided with external constraints. And guess
where those external constraints need to come from: her parents
and other caregivers, and the guidelines and expectations they
communicate to her. We need to help develop our children’s upstairs
brain—along with all of the skills it makes possible—and while doing so,
we may need to act as an external upstairs brain along the way,
working with them and helping them make decisions they’re not quite
capable yet of making for themselves.
We’ll soon go into this idea in much greater depth, and oʃer
practical suggestions for making it happen. For now, though, just
keep this initial Brain C in mind: a child’s brain is changing and
developing, so we need to temper our expectations and understand
that emotional and behavioral challenges are simply par for the
course. Of course we should still teach and expect respectful
behavior. But in doing so, we need to always keep in mind the
changing, developing brain. Once we understand and accept this
fundamental reality, we’ll be much more capable of responding in a
way that honors the child and the relationship, while still attending
to any behaviors we need to address.
“Brain C” #2: The Brain Is Changeable
The second Brain C is immensely exciting and oʃers hope to
parents everywhere: the brain is not only changing—it develops
over time—but changeable—it can be molded intentionally by
experience. If you read much about the brain these days, you’ll
likely come across the concept of “neuroplasticity,
” which refers to
the way the brain physically changes based on experiences we
undergo. As scientists put it, the brain is plastic, or moldable. Yes,
the actual physical architecture of the brain changes based on what
happens to us.
You may have heard about scientiɹc studies that demonstrate
evidence of neuroplasticity. In The Whole-Brain Child, we talk about
research showing enlarged auditory centers in the brains of animals
who depend on their hearing for hunting, and studies showing that
for violinists, the regions of the cortex that represent the left hand
—which ɹngers the instrument’s strings at amazing speeds—are
larger than normal.
Other recent studies demonstrate that children who are taught to
read music and play the keyboard undergo signiɹcant changes in
their brain and have an advanced capacity for what’s called “spatial
sensorimotor mapping.” In other words, when kids learn even the
fundamentals of playing piano, their brains develop diʃerently
from the brains of kids who don’t, so they can more fully
understand their own bodies in relationship to the objects around
them. We’ve seen similar results in studies on people who
meditate. Mindfulness exercises produce literal changes in the
brain’s connections, signiɹcantly aʃecting how well a person
interacts with other people and adapts to difficult situations.
Obviously, this isn’t to say that all children should take piano
lessons, or that everyone should meditate (although we wouldn’t
discourage either activity!). The point is that the experience of
taking the lessons, like the experience of participating in
mindfulness practices (or playing the violin or even practicing
karate), fundamentally and physically changes the plastic brain—
especially while it’s developing in childhood and adolescence, but
even throughout our lives. To take a more extreme example, early
childhood abuse can leave people vulnerable to mental illness later
in life. Recent studies have used functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI), or brain scans, to discover speciɹc changes in
certain areas of what’s called the hippocampus in the brains of
young adults who have experienced abuse. They experience higher
rates of depression, addiction, and post-traumatic stress disorder
(PTSD). Their brains have fundamentally changed in response to
the trauma they faced as children.
Neuroplasticity has enormous ramiɹcations for what we do as
parents. If repeated experiences actually change the physical
architecture of the brain, then it becomes paramount that we be
intentional about the experiences we give our children. Think about the
ways you interact with your kids. How do you communicate with
them? How do you help them reɻect on their actions and
behavior? What do you teach them about relationships—about
respect, trust, and eʃort? What opportunities do you expose them
to? What important people do you introduce into their lives?
Everything they see, hear, feel, touch, or even smell impacts their
brain and thus inɻuences the way they view and interact with their
world—including their family, neighbors, strangers, friends,
classmates, and even themselves.
All of this takes place at the cellular level, in our neurons and in
the connections among our brain cells called synapses. One way
neuroscientists have expressed the idea is that “neurons that ɹre
together wire together.”
This phrase, known as “Hebb’s axiom,
” named after the Canadian
neuropsychologist Donald Hebb, essentially explains that when
neurons ɹre simultaneously in response to an experience, those
neurons become connected to each other, forming a network. And
when an experience is repeated over and over, it deepens and
strengthens the connections among those neurons. So when they
fire together, they wire together.
The famous physiologist Ivan Pavlov was coming to terms with
this idea when he found that his dogs would salivate not only when
actual food appeared before them, but also when he rang the
dinner bell for them to come eat. The dogs’ “salivation neurons”
became wired, or functionally linked, to their “dinner-bell
neurons.” A more recent example from the animal world appears
every time the San Francisco Giants play a night game at AT&T
Park. Near the end of each game swarms of seagulls appear, ready
for a feast of left-behind hot dogs, peanuts, and Cracker Jack once
the bayside stadium empties. Biologists are stumped as to how,
exactly, the birds time their arrival for the ninth inning. Is it the
increased noise of the crowd? The lure of the stadium lights? The
organ playing “Take Me Out to the Ball Game” during the seventhinning stretch? One thing seems clear, though: the birds have been
conditioned, or primed, to expect food once the game ends.
Neurons have fired together and subsequently been wired together.
Hebb’s axiom is what causes a toddler to raise his hands and say
“Hold you?” when he wants to be picked up. He hardly
understands the meaning of the exact words, and obviously hasn’t
quite ɹgured out his pronouns. But he knows that when he’s been
asked,
“Do you want me to hold you?” he’s been picked up. So
when he wants to be held, he asks,
“Hold you?” Firing and wiring.
Having neurons wire together can be a good thing. A positive
experience with a math teacher can lead to neural connections that
link math with pleasure, accomplishment, and feeling good about
yourself as a student. But the opposite is equally true. Negative
experiences with a harsh instructor or a timed test and the anxiety
that accompanies it can form connections in the brain that create a
serious obstacle to the enjoyment not only of math and numbers,
but exams and even school in general.
The point is simple but crucial to understand: experiences lead to
changes in the architecture of the brain. Practically, then, we want
to keep neuroplasticity in mind when we make decisions about
how we interact with kids and how they spend their time. We want
to consider what neural connections are being formed and how
they will play out in the future.
For example, what movies do you want your kids to see, and
what activities do you want them to spend hours of time enjoying?
Knowing that the plastic brain will be altered with experience, we
might be less comfortable with hours spent watching certain
television programs or playing violent video games. We might
instead encourage our kids to engage in activities that build their
capacity for relationships and for understanding other people—
whether that means hanging out with friends, playing games with
their family, or participating in sports and other group activities
that ask them to work with others as a team. We might even
purposely create time for boredom on a summer day, so they have
to go to the garage and see what interesting fun they can have with
a pulley, some rope, and a roll of duct tape. (If someone comes
back inside to Google the phrase “duct tape parachute for baby
brother,
” you might want to break out the Monopoly board.)
We cannot, nor would we want to, protect or rescue our kids
from all adversity and negative experiences. These challenging
experiences are an important part of growing up and developing
resilience, along with acquiring internal skills needed to cope with
stress and failure and to respond with flexibility. What we can do is
help our children make sense of their experiences so that those
challenges will more likely be encoded in the brain consciously as
“learning experiences,
” rather than unconscious associations or
even traumas that limit them in the future. When parents discuss
experiences and memories with their kids, the children tend to
have better access to memories of those experiences. Kids whose
parents talk to them about their feelings also develop a more
robust emotional intelligence and can therefore be better at
noticing and understanding their own and other people’s feelings.
Neurons that ɹre together wire together, changing the changeable
brain.
It all comes back to the point that the brain changes in response
to experience. What do you want your children to experience that
will aʃect their changeable brains? What brain connections do you
want to nurture? And more to the point in this book: knowing that
a child’s brain is changeable, how do you want to respond to
misbehavior? After all, your kids’ repeated experiences with
discipline will be wiring their brains as well.
“Brain C” #3: The Brain Is Complex
So the brain is changing and changeable. It’s also complex, which is
our third Brain C. The brain is multifaceted, with diʃerent parts
responsible for diʃerent tasks. Some parts are responsible for
memory, others for language, others for empathy, and so on.
This third Brain C is one of the most important realities to keep
in mind when it comes to discipline. The brain’s complexity means
that when our kids are upset, or when they’re acting in ways we
don’t like, we can appeal to diʃerent “parts” of their brains, to
diʃerent regions and ways the brain functions, with diʃerent
parental responses activating diʃerent circuitry. We can therefore
appeal to one part of the brain to get one result, another part to get
a different result.
For example, let’s go back to the upstairs and downstairs brains.
If your child is melting down and out of control, which part of the
brain would you rather appeal to? The one that’s primitive and
reactive? Or the one that’s sophisticated and capable of logic,
compassion, and self-understanding? Do we try to connect to the
one that responds as a reptile would—with defensiveness and
attacks—or to the one with the potential to calm down, problemsolve, and even apologize? The answer is obvious. We want to
engage the upstairs brain’s receptivity, rather than trigger the
downstairs brain’s reactivity. Then the higher parts of the brain can
communicate and help override the lower, more impulsive and
reactive parts.
When we discipline with threats—whether explicitly through our
words or implicitly through scary nonverbals like our tone,
posture, and facial expressions—we activate the defensive circuits
of our child’s reactive reptilian downstairs brain. We call this
“poking the lizard,
” and we don’t recommend it because it almost
always leads to escalating emotions, for both parent and child.
When your ɹve-year-old throws a ɹt at the grocery store, and you
tower over him and point your ɹnger and insist through clenched
teeth that he “calm down this instant,
” you’re poking the lizard.
You’re triggering a downstairs reaction, which is almost never
going to lead anywhere productive for anyone involved. Your
child’s sensory system takes in your body language and words and
detects threat, which biologically sets oʃ the neural circuitry that
allows him to survive a threat from his environment—to ɹght, to
ɻee, to freeze, or to faint. His downstairs brain springs into action,
preparing to react quickly rather than fully considering alternatives
in a more responsive, receptive state. His muscles might tense as
he prepares to defend himself and, if necessary, attack with freeze
and ɹght. Or he may run away in ɻight, or collapse in a fainting
response. Each of these is a pathway of reactivity of the downstairs
brain. And his thinking, rational self-control circuitry of the
upstairs brain goes oʃ-line, becoming unavailable in that moment.
That’s the key—we can’t be in both a reactive downstairs state and
a receptive upstairs state at the same time. The downstairs
reactivity holds sway.
In this situation, you can appeal to your child’s more
sophisticated upstairs brain, and allow it to help rein in the more
reactive downstairs brain. By demonstrating respect for your child,
nurturing him with lots of empathy, and remaining open to
collaborative and reɻective discussions, you communicate “no
threat,
” so the reptilian brain can relax its reactivity. In doing so,
you activate the upstairs circuits, including the extremely
important prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for calm decision
making and controlling emotions and impulses. That’s how we
move from reactivity to receptivity. And that’s what we want to
teach our children to do.
So instead of ɹercely demanding that your ɹve-year-old calm
down, you can help quiet and soothe the downstairs brain and
instead bring the upstairs brain online by gently inviting him to be
physically close to you and listening to whatever he’s upset about.
(If you’re in a public place and your child is disturbing everyone
around you, it may be necessary to take him outside while you
attempt to appeal to his upstairs brain.)
Research supports this strategy of engaging the upstairs brain
rather than enraging the downstairs. We’ve seen, for example, that
when a person is shown a photo of a face that’s angry or afraid,
activity increases in a region of the downstairs brain called the
amygdala (pronounced uh-MIG-duh-luh), which is responsible for
quickly processing and expressing strong emotions, especially anger
and fear. One of the amygdala’s primary jobs is to remain alert and
to sound an alarm anytime we are threatened, allowing us to act
quickly. Interestingly, simply seeing a photograph of a person with
an angry or frightened face causes the viewer’s amygdala to
activate. In fact, even if the viewer sees the photo so quickly that
he or she isn’t consciously aware of having seen the picture, a
subliminal, instinctual, emotional reaction causes the amygdala to
fire, or become active.
What’s even more fascinating about the study is that when
viewers were asked to label the emotion in the picture, and named
it as fear or anger, their amygdala immediately became less active.
Why? Because part of the upstairs brain—a part called the
ventrolateral prefrontal cortex—took charge with the labeling and
then processed the emotion, allowing the thinking, analytical part
of the brain to take over and soothe the irritated lower regions,
rather than letting the reactive, emotional downstairs brain
dominate and dictate the person’s feelings and responses. This is a
classic example of the “name it to tame it” strategy we discuss in
detail in The Whole-Brain Child. Simply by naming the emotion, a
person feels her levels of fear and anger decrease. That’s how the
upstairs brain can calm the downstairs brain. And that’s a skill that
can last a lifetime.

This is what we want to do for our kids when they become upset
and act out: help them engage their upstairs brain. The prefrontal
part of the upstairs brain actually has soothing ɹbers that can calm
the lower regions when they are reactive. The key is to grow them
well in our children, and to activate them in a moment of distress
by ɹrst connecting before redirecting. We want our kids to develop
the internal skill to calm the storm and reɻect on what’s happening
inside.
Think back about the functions of the upstairs brain: good
decision making, control over emotions and body, ɻexibility,
empathy, self-understanding, and morality. These are the aspects of
our kids’ character we want to develop, right? As we put it in The
Whole-Brain Child, we want to engage the upstairs brain, rather
than enraging the downstairs brain. Engage, don’t enrage. When we
enrage the downstairs brain, that’s usually because our amygdala is
ɹring as well. And guess what the amygdala wants to do. Win! So
when the amygdalae in both the parent and the child are ɹring at
top speed, both looking to win, it’s virtually always going to be a
dramatic battle that ends with both sides losing. No one will win,
and relational casualties will litter the battleɹeld. All because we
enraged the downstairs, rather than engaging the upstairs.
To use a diʃerent metaphor, it’s as if you have a remote control
for your child, and you have the power, at least to some extent, to
determine what kind of a response you’ll receive when you two
interact. Press the engage button—the “calm down and think”
button—and you’ll appeal to the upstairs brain, activating a
calming response. But push the enrage button—the “freak out and
escalate emotions” button—by using threats and demands, and
you’ll be practically begging for the ɹghting part of the brain to
click into action. You’ll poke the lizard and get a reptilian, reactive
response. It’s up to you which button to press.

Remember, none of this is to excuse parents from the
responsibility of setting boundaries and clearly communicating
expectations. We’ll give you lots of practical suggestions for doing
so in the coming pages. But as you set those boundaries and
communicate those expectations, you’ll make things much easier on
yourself, your child, and anyone else within shouting range if you
appeal to your child’s wiser and receptive self and her upstairs
brain, as opposed to her lizard reactiveness and her downstairs
brain.
What’s even more exciting is what happens after we appeal to the
upstairs brain. When it gets engaged repeatedly, it becomes strong.
Neurons that ɹre together wire together. So when a child is in an
upset state of mind and we invite the upstairs brain to become
active, we create a functional linkage between that dysregulated
state and an activation of the part of her brain that brings her back
into a well-regulated state. We can likely grow those soothing
ɹbers that extend from the prefrontal upstairs brain into the
downstairs brain.
That means the more we appeal to our child’s more integrated
nature—the more we ask her to think before she acts or to consider
someone else’s feelings, the more we ask her to act ethically or
empathically—then the more she’ll use her upstairs brain, and the
stronger it will become, because it is building connections and
becoming more integrated with the downstairs areas. Using her
upstairs brain will more and more become her accessible pathway,
her automatic default, even when emotions run high. As a result,
she’ll become better and better at making good decisions, handling
her emotions, and caring for others.
Applying the Brain C’s
Let’s talk now about what the three Brain C’s—changing,
changeable, and complex—look like in action. When Nina freaked
out on the porch step, Liz’s ɹrst instinct was to logically explain
how the transportation decisions had been made: “Your sister’s
school is right by my work.” She could have gone on to explain
that Tim had more time to drive Nina to her school, and that Nina
had just yesterday been asking for more time with her father. All
of these statements were true, and rational.
However, as we’ve said, when a child is in the throes of a
meltdown, logic will often be ineʃective, sometimes even
counterproductive. This is what Liz recognized as she looked at her
fury-ɹlled daughter. In eʃect, what she realized was the ɹrst of the
three Brain C’s: Nina’s brain was changing. It was developing. Not
developed, developing. Which meant that Liz needed to be patient
with her little girl and not expect her to consistently control herself
like an adult, or even like an older child. She took a deep breath
and worked to remain calm, despite the stress being produced by
the unreasonable four-year-old, the impatient seven-year-old, and
the ever-ticking clock.
Just as important in this situation was the second Brain C, that
the brain is changeable. Liz understood that the way she and her
husband handled each situation with their daughters wired the
girls’ developing brains, for good or for bad. So in this moment of
awareness, Liz resisted the urge she currently felt, which was to
hurriedly and even aggressively pick up her crying daughter, march
her to Tim’s car stomping all the way, strap her into her car seat,
and slam the door.
By the way, if you recognize yourself in the anger-ɹlled
depiction of how Liz wanted to handle the situation, you’re not
alone. We’ve all been there. (See “When a Parenting Expert Loses
It” at the back of the book.) Caring parents will often condemn
themselves over every little mistake they make, or for every time
they miss an opportunity to approach a diɽcult moment from a
Whole-Brain perspective. We urge you to listen to this internal
critic only long enough to gain some awareness so that you can do
better the next time, but then be generous and forgiving of
yourself. Of course you want to do your best with and for your
kids. But as we’ll explain in detail in the book’s conclusion, even
parental mistakes can be extremely valuable for our kids—we can
teach them we are all human, and we can take responsibility for
what happens and make a repair. That’s an essential teaching
experience for all children.
Liz was human and a parent, so of course she made her share of
mistakes, as we all do. But in this instance she disciplined from a
No-Drama, Whole-Brain frame of mind and made an intentional
decision to take a moment and be there emotionally for her young
daughter. By this point the family was less than one minute behind
schedule. And Liz realized that even though Nina’s feelings seemed
dramatic, they were real. She needed her mom right then. So Liz
denied the impulse to do what was easiest and quickest, and again
pulled her daughter close to her.
As for speciɹcally how she responded to the situation, that’s
where the third Brain C—complex—comes in. Liz understood her
daughter well enough to know better than to enrage the downstairs
brain. It was plenty active already. Instead, she needed to engage
Nina’s upstairs brain. The ɹrst step, though, had to be to connect.
Before redirecting, we always connect. That’s what Liz was doing
when she held her daughter. Yes, she was in a hurry, but nothing
positive could happen until Nina calmed down some, which didn’t
take long once she was in her mother’s arms. In just a few seconds
Liz felt Nina take a deep breath and her little body begin to soften.
If Nina were your child, you might have handled this situation in
one of a few ways, depending on your style and her temperament.
Like Liz, you would probably seek as your ɹrst goal to help your
daughter calm down, so that her upstairs brain would come back
online and she could listen to reason. You might promise to get up
early tomorrow morning so you’d have time to take her to school.
Or you might assure her that you’d ask your boss if you could leave
work early this afternoon so you could pick up your daughter and
then have some one-on-one special time with her. Or you might
oʃer to tell her a story on speakerphone from your car as her dad
drove her to school.
As it turned out, Liz tried several of these strategies, all to no
avail. No creative inspiration hit the mark. Nina was having none
of it.
Aren’t you glad we didn’t use an example in which that situation
worked out nicely and perfectly? You’re relieved, aren’t you,
because you know it doesn’t always go that way. No matter how
skillfully we handle a situation, and no matter how cognizant we
remain of important information like the three Brain C’s, at times
our kids still don’t do things the way we’d like. They don’t pick up
their toys. They don’t automatically apologize to their brother.
They don’t calm down. Which is exactly what happened here. Nina
would not cooperate. Listening to her feelings, holding her, coming
up with a plan … nothing did the trick.
But Liz still had to leave for work, and the kids had to get to
school. So, remaining calm and empathic—that’s our goal—she
explained that they had to go, and that Tim would drive her to
school this morning as planned: “I know you’re sad, and I
understand that you want to ride with me. I would like that, too.
But we can’t make that work today. Would you like to climb in or
would you like Daddy to help you get in the car now? Daddy will
be with you to comfort you on the way to school. I love you and
I’ll see you this afternoon.” And with that, the front-porch situation
ended, with Tim holding a crying Nina as he carried her to his car.
Notice what we’re acknowledging here. No-Drama Discipline
can’t ensure that your kids will act the way you’d like every time
you address their behavior. The Whole-Brain approach deɹnitely
gives you a much better chance of achieving the short-term goal of
encouraging cooperation from your children. It also helps remove
or at least reduce the most explosive emotions in the situation,
deescalating the drama and thus avoiding the harm and hurt that
result when a parent yells or personalizes the issue. But it won’t
always be eʃective at getting the exact behavior you hope for. Kids
are human beings, after all, who have their own emotions, desires,
and agendas; they’re not computers we program to do what we
want. But at the very least, as we’re sure you’ll agree after you
read the following chapters, No-Drama Discipline gives you a much
better chance of communicating with your children in ways that
feel better to both of you, build trust and respect between you, and
decrease the drama in most discipline situations.
What’s more, a Whole-Brain approach provides a way to show
our kids how much we love and respect them, even as we
discipline them. They know—and we reinforce it over and over
throughout their lives—that when they’re upset or acting
inappropriately, we’re going to be there for them. And with them.
We don’t turn our back or reject them when they’re distressed. We
don’t say, or even imply, that their happiness is a condition they
must meet to receive our love. No-Drama Discipline allows us to
communicate to our children,
“I’m with you. I’ve got your back. Even
when you’re at your worst and I don’t like the way you’re acting, I love
you, and I’m here for you. I understand you’re having a hard time, and
I am here.” No parent can communicate this message all the time in
every scenario. But we can send it consistently and repeatedly, so
there’s never any question in our children’s minds.
This kind of predictable, sensitive, loving, relational discipline
allows kids to feel safe. As a result, they have the freedom to
become independent individuals whose brains are wired in such a
way that they are better able to think through decisions,
comprehend what they actually feel about a situation, consider
others’ perspectives, and come to a sound conclusion on their own.
In other words, the experiences of emotional and physical safety
give them the capacity to act responsibly and make good choices.
In contrast, a parenting style focused on control and fear, stressing
that a child needs to toe the line all the time, undermines that
feeling of safety. If a child lives in constant worry that he might
mess up and make his parents unhappy or that he’ll be punished, he
won’t feel the freedom to do all the things that grow and
strengthen his upstairs brain: considering others’ feelings, exploring
alternative actions, understanding himself, and trying to make the
best decision in a given situation. We don’t want our discipline to
cause our children to focus all of their energy and neural resources
on making us happy or staying out of trouble. Instead, we want our
discipline to help grow our kids’ upstairs brains. And that’s just
what No-Drama Discipline does.
No-Drama Discipline Builds the Brain
The three Brain C’s lead to one crucial and undeniable conclusion,
which is the central notion of this chapter: No-Drama Discipline
actually helps build the brain. That’s right. It’s not only that a
Whole-Brain approach can defuse diɽcult and highly charged
situations with your kids. Or that it will help you build your
relationship with them as you more clearly communicate how
much you love them and that they are safe, even as you set
boundaries for their behavior. All that’s true; the discipline
principles and strategies we’ll show you in the coming pages really
do oʃer all of those beneɹts, making your day-to-day life easier
and less stressful while nurturing your relationship with your child.
But beyond all that, No-Drama Discipline actually builds a child’s
brain. It strengthens neural connections between the upstairs and
downstairs parts of the brain, and these connections lead to
personal insight, responsibility, ɻexible decision making, empathy,
and morality. The reason is that when we help strengthen the
connective ɹbers between the upstairs and downstairs, the higher
parts of the brain can communicate with and override a child’s
primitive impulses more and more often. And our disciplinary
decisions go a long way toward determining how strong those
connections are. The way we interact with our kids when they’re upset
signiɹcantly aʃects how their brains develop, and therefore what kind of
people they are, both today and in the years to come. This is how our
way of communicating with our children impacts their internal
skills, which are embedded in the connections in their changing,
changeable, and complex brains!
It makes perfect sense when you think about it. Every time we
give a child the experience of exercising his upstairs brain, it gets
stronger and more fully developed. When we ask him questions
that develop insight into himself, he becomes more insightful.
When we encourage her to empathize with someone else, she
becomes more empathic.
When we give a child the opportunity to decide how he should
act, rather than simply telling him what he should do, he becomes
a better decision maker.
And that’s one of the ultimate goals of parenting, isn’t it? That
our kids become more insightful, empathic, and able to make good
decisions on their own? You know the old saying: “Give a man a
ɹsh, and he’ll eat for a day. Teach a man to ɹsh, and he’ll eat for a
lifetime.” Our ultimate goal isn’t that our children do what we
want them to do because we’re watching them or telling them what
to do. (That would be fairly impractical, after all, unless we plan
on living and going to work with them for the rest of their lives.)
Rather, we want to help them learn to make positive and
productive choices on their own in whatever situation they face.
And that means we need to view the times they misbehave as
opportunities to give them practice building important skills and
having those experiences wired into the brain.
Building the Brain by Setting Limits
This perspective can completely change the way we look at the
opportunities we have to help our kids make better choices. When
we set limits, we help develop the parts of the upstairs brain that
allow children to control themselves and regulate their behaviors
and their body.
One way to think about it is that we’re helping our kids develop
the ability to shift between the diʃerent aspects of what’s called
the autonomic nervous system. One part of the autonomic nervous
system is the sympathetic branch, which you can think of as the
“accelerator” of the system. Like a gas pedal, it causes us to react
with gusto to impulses and situations, as it primes the body for
action. The other part is the parasympathetic branch, which serves
as the “brakes” of the system and allows us to stop and regulate
ourselves and our impulses. Keeping the accelerator and the brakes
in balance is key for emotional regulation, so when we help
children develop the capacity to control themselves even when
they’re upset, we’re helping them learn to balance these two
branches of the autonomic nervous system.
Purely in terms of brain functioning, sometimes an activated
accelerator (which might result in a child’s inappropriate and
impulsive action) followed by the sudden application of brakes (in
the form of parental limit setting) leads to a nervous system
response that may cause the child to stop and feel a sense of
shame. When this happens, the physiologic manifestation might
result in avoiding eye contact, feeling a heaviness in her chest, and
possibly experiencing a sinking feeling in her stomach. Parents
might describe this by saying she “feels bad about what she’s
done.”
This initial awareness of having crossed a line is extremely
healthy, and it’s evidence of a child’s developing upstairs brain.
Some scientists suggest that limit setting that creates a “healthy
sense of shame” leads to an internal compass to guide future
behavior. It means she’s beginning to acquire a conscience, or an
inner voice, along with an understanding of morality and selfcontrol. Over time, as her parents repeatedly help her recognize
the moments when she needs to put on the brakes, her behavior
begins to change. It’s more than simply learning that a particular
action is bad, or that her parents don’t like what she’s done, so
she’d better avoid that action or she’ll get in trouble. More occurs
within this child than just learning the rules of good vs. bad or
acceptable vs. unacceptable.
Rather, her brain actually changes, and her nervous system gets
wired to tell her what “feels right,
” which modiɹes her future
behavior. New experiences wire new connections among her
neurons, and the changes in the circuitry of her brain
fundamentally and positively alter the way she interacts with her
world. The way her parents help this process along is by lovingly
and empathically teaching her which behaviors are acceptable and
which aren’t. That’s why it’s essential that we set limits and that
our children internalize “no” when necessary, particularly in the
early years, when the regulatory circuits of the brain are wiring up.
By helping them understand the rules and limits in their respective
environments, we help build their conscience.
This is often diɽcult for a loving parent. We want our kids to be
happy, and we like it when they receive what they desire. Plus
we’re aware of how quickly a pleasant situation can devolve when
a child doesn’t get what he wants. However, if we truly love our
kids and want what’s best for them, we need to be able to tolerate
the tension and discomfort they (and we) may experience when we
set a limit. We want to say yes to our children as often as possible,
but sometimes saying no is the most loving thing we can do.
One caveat here: Many parents say no, or a form of it, far too
often. They say it automatically, often when it’s not necessary. Stop
touching that balloon. No running. Don’t spill. Our point here isn’t
that we want our kids to hear the word “no” a lot. In fact, much
more eʃective than an outright no is a yes with a condition: “Yes,
you can take a bath later” or “Yes, we’ll read another story, but
we’ll need to do it tomorrow.” The point, in other words, is not to
make a point of saying no, but to understand the importance of helping
kids recognize limits so that they become increasingly better at putting
on the brakes themselves when necessary.
A second caveat is important to note here, too. When limitsetting and “no” are accompanied by parental anger or negative
comments that assault a child, the “healthy, developmental shame”
of a child simply learning to curb his or her behavior now is
transformed into more complicated “toxic shame” and humiliation.
One view proposes that toxic shame involves not simply the sense
of having done something wrong, which can and needs to be
corrected, but the painful sense that one’s inner self is defective.
And this belief that the self is damaged is felt to be an
unchangeable condition of the child—not a behavior that can be
modiɹed. Some researchers consider this move from “behavior to
be changed in the future” to a “self that is fundamentally ɻawed”
as the outcome for children who experience repeated parental
hostility in response to their behavior. Toxic shame and
humiliation can continue through childhood and into adulthood,
even beneath the surface of awareness, leaving individuals with a
hidden “secret” that they are permanently and deeply defective. A
cascade of negative consequences—having trouble with close
relationships that might reveal this hidden secret, feeling
unworthy, being driven to succeed in life but never feeling satisɹed
—can then dominate the individual’s life. You as a parent can avoid
giving your child this negative cascade of toxic shame by learning
how to create needed structure without humiliating your child.
That’s an achievable goal, and we are committed to making that
path available to you if you choose it.
What it all comes down to is that No-Drama Discipline
encourages kids to look inside themselves, consider the feelings of
others, and make decisions that are often diɽcult, even when they
have the impulse or desire to do things another way. It allows
children to put into practice the emotional and social abilities we
want them to understand and master. It allows you to create
structure with respect. When we’re willing to lovingly set a
boundary—just like when we discipline with an awareness that our
children’s brains are changing, changeable, and complex—we help
create neural connections that improve our kids’ capacity for
relationships, self-control, empathy, personal insight, morality, and
much, much more. And they can feel good about who they are as
individuals while learning to modify their behavior.

All of this leads to an exciting conclusion for parents: every time
our children misbehave, they give us an opportunity to understand
them better, and get a better sense of what they need help
learning. Children often act out because they haven’t yet developed
skills in a particular area. So when your three-year-old pulls her
classmate’s hair because he got the ɹrst Dixie cup full of ɹsh
crackers, she’s actually telling you,
“I need to build skills in waiting
my turn.” Likewise, when your seven-year-old becomes deɹant and
calls you “Fart-face Jones” after you tell him it’s time to leave his
playdate, he’s actually saying,
“I need skill building when it comes
to handling myself well and communicating my disappointment
respectfully when I don’t get my way.” By misbehaving, kids
actually communicate to us what they need to be working on—
what has not yet been developed or what speciɹc skills they need
practice with.
The bad news is that it’s rarely much fun, either for the child or
for the parent. The good news is that we get information we might
not otherwise receive. The even better news is that we can then
take intentional steps to give our kids experiences that help them
improve on their ability to share, think of others, speak kindly, and
so on. We’re not saying that when your children don’t handle
things well, you should necessarily celebrate. (“Yay! An
opportunity to help a brain develop optimally with my intentional
response!”) You’re probably not going to enjoy discipline, or look
forward to future meltdowns. But when you realize that these
“misbehavior moments” aren’t just miserable experiences to
endure, but actually opportunities for knowledge and growth, you
can reframe the whole experience and recognize it as a chance to
build the brain and create something meaningful and signiɹcant in
your child’s life.

CHAPTER 3
From Tantrum to Tranquility: Connection Is the
Key
ichael heard voices rising in his sons’ room but was watching
the basketball game on TV and decided to wait for a
commercial before investigating. Big mistake.
His eight-year-old, Graham, and Graham’s friend James had
spent the last thirty minutes carefully organizing and categorizing
Graham’s hundreds of Lego pieces. Graham had used his allowance
to buy a ɹshing tackle box, and he had designated a diʃerent
compartment for every Lego head, torso, helmet, sword, light
saber, wand, axe, and anything else the creative geniuses from
Denmark could dream up. The boys were in organizational heaven.
The problem was that Michael’s ɹve-year-old, Matthias, had
been feeling increasingly left out by Graham and James. The three
boys had begun the project together, but the older boys eventually
felt that Matthias didn’t quite understand their complex categorical
system. As a result, they weren’t allowing him to participate in the
activity.
Cue the rising voices.
Michael never made it to the commercial. The shouting let him
know that he needed to intervene immediately, but he wasn’t quick
enough. When he was still three steps away from the boys’ room
—three short steps!—he heard the unmistakable sound of hundreds
of plastic Lego pieces exploding across a hardwood floor.
Three steps later he witnessed the mayhem and carnage. It was a
complete massacre. Decapitated heads littered the entire room,
lying next to armless bodies and weapons both medieval and
futuristic. A rainbow of chaos stretched from the doorway to the
closet on the other side of the room.
Next to the upended tackle box stood Michael’s huɽng, redfaced ɹve-year-old, looking at him with eyes that were somehow
both deɹant and terriɹed. Michael turned to his older son, who
yelled,
“He ruins everything!” and ran from the room in tears,
followed by a sheepish-looking and uncomfortable James.
Talk about a discipline moment. Both of his boys were now
bawling, a friend was caught in the crossɹre, and Michael himself
felt furious. Not only had Matthias destroyed all the work the older
boys had done, but now there was a huge mess to clean up in the
room. (If you’ve ever felt the pain of stepping on a Lego piece, you
know why it wasn’t an option to leave the bits spread out on the
floor.) And he was missing the game.
Michael decided he’d go check on the older boys in a minute and
address Matthias ɹrst. His initial inclination was to stand over his
young son, wag his ɹnger in his son’s face, and scold him for
dumping the tackle box. In his anger he wanted to oʃer immediate
consequences. He wanted to shout,
“Why did you do this?” He
wanted to say something about never again getting to participate in
Graham’s playdates, then add,
“Do you see why they didn’t want
you to play with their Legos?”
Luckily, though, the thinking part of Michael (his upstairs brain)
took over, and he addressed the situation from a Whole-Brain
perspective. What triggered the more mature and empathic
approach was his recognition of how much his little boy needed
him right then. Of course Michael would have to address Matthias’s
behavior. And yes, he’d obviously need to be a bit more proactive
next time in attending to the situation before it spun out of control.
He’d want to help Matthias think about how Graham felt, and
understand that our actions often impact other people in signiɹcant
ways. All of this teaching, all of this redirection, was absolutely
necessary.
But not right now.
Right now, he needed to connect.
Matthias was completely dysregulated emotionally, and he
needed his dad to soothe the hurt feelings, sadness, and anger that
came from being criticized for being too little to understand and
from being excluded. This was not the time to redirect, to teach, or
to talk about family rules and respect for others’ property. It was
time to connect.
So Michael knelt down and opened his arms, and Matthias fell
into them. Michael held him as he sobbed, rubbed his back, and
said nothing other than an occasional “I know, buddy. I know.”
A minute later Matthias looked up at him, his eyes shiny with
tears, and said,
“I spilt the Legos.”
In response, Michael laughed a little and said,
“I’d say you did
more than that, little man!”
Matthias cracked a small smile, and at that point Michael knew
he could now proceed to the redirecting part of the discipline and
help Matthias understand some important lessons about empathy
and appropriate expressions of big feelings. He was now capable of
hearing his father. Michael’s connection and comfort had allowed
his son to move out of a reactive state and into a receptive one,
where he could hear his dad and really learn.
Notice that connecting ɹrst is not only more relational and
loving. Yes, it allows parents to attune to their children, as Michael
did here, and be emotionally responsive when they’re upset and
dysregulated. That enables the child to “feel felt,
” which is the
inner sense of being seen and understood that transforms chaos
into calm, isolation into connection. Connecting ɹrst is a
fundamentally loving way to discipline. But notice how much more
effective a No-Drama disciplinary approach can be as well. It’s not
that a lecture would have been wrong as Michael’s initial response
to the situation. Our point here isn’t about the rightness or
wrongness of parenting approaches (although we’d deɹnitely argue
that a Whole-Brain approach is fundamentally more loving and
compassionate). The point is that Michael’s connect-ɹrst tactic
achieved the two goals of discipline—gaining cooperation and brain
building—extremely eʃectively. It allowed learning to occur,
teaching to be eʃective, and connection to be established and
maintained. His approach let Michael get his son’s attention, and to
do so quickly and without drama, so they could talk about
Matthias’s behavior in such a way that he could listen. Plus, it could
help build Matthias’s brain, because he could now hear Michael’s
points and understand the important lessons his father was teaching
him. In addition, Michael modeled for his son attuned connection
and showed him that there are calmer, more loving ways to
interact when you’re upset with someone. And all of this happened
because Michael connected first, before redirecting.
Proactive Parenting
We’ll talk in just a minute about why connection is such a powerful
tool when our kids are upset or having trouble making good
decisions. Michael obviously used it eʃectively. But by being just a
bit slow to respond to the situation—three short steps!—he missed
an opportunity to avoid the entire disciplinary process completely.
It really is true. At times we can avoid having to discipline at all,
simply by parenting proactively, rather than reactively. When we
parent proactively, we watch for times we can tell that
misbehavior and/or a meltdown is in our children’s near future—
it’s just over the horizon of where they are right now—and we step
in and try to guide them around that potential landmine. Michael
wanted to make it to the next commercial, so he didn’t respond
quickly enough to the signs that trouble was beginning to surface in
his sons’ room.
Parenting proactively can make all the diʃerence. When, for
example, your sweet and usually compliant eight-year-old is getting
ready to go to her swim lesson, you might notice that she
overreacts a bit when it’s time to apply sunscreen: “Why do I have
to use sunscreen every day?” Then while you’re getting her little
brother ready, she sits down at the piano for a minute to play one
of her songs. But she misses a couple of notes, then slams her ɹst
on the keyboard in frustration.
You could interpret these actions as isolated incidents and
overlook them. Or you could recognize them for the warning ɻags
they probably are. You might remember that this particular
daughter gets especially upset when she’s hungry, so you might
stop what you’re doing and set an apple in front of her. When she
looks up at you, you can oʃer her a knowing smile as a reminder
of this tendency of hers, and hopefully she’ll nod, eat the apple,
and move back into a place of self-control.
Granted, sometimes no obvious signs present themselves before
our kids make bad decisions and act in ways that aren’t ideal. But
other times we can read our children’s cues and take proactive
steps to stay ahead of the discipline curve. That might mean giving
a warning ɹve minutes before having to leave the park, or
enforcing a consistent bedtime so your kids don’t get too tired and
grumpy. It might mean starting to tell a preschooler a suspenseful
story and then pausing it, explaining that you’ll tell what happens
next once she’s in her car seat. Or maybe it means you step in to
begin a new game when you hear that your children are moving
toward signiɹcant conɻict with each other. It might mean telling a
toddler, with a voice full of intriguing energy,
“Hey, before you
throw that french fry across the restaurant, I want to show you
w
h
a
t
I
h
a
v
e
i
n
m
y
p
u
r
s
e
.
”
Another way to parent proactively is to HALT before responding
to your kids. When you see your child’s behavior trending in a
direction you don’t like, ask yourself,
“Is he hungry, angry, lonely,
o r tired?” It may be that all you need to do is to set out some
raisins, listen to his feelings, play a game with him, or help him get
more sleep. Sometimes, in other words, all you need is a bit of
forethought and planning ahead.
Parenting proactively isn’t easy, and it takes a fair amount of
awareness on your part. But the more you can watch for the
beginnings of negative behaviors and head them oʃ at the pass, the less
you’ll end up having to pick up the literal or ɹgurative pieces, meaning
you and your children will have more time simply to enjoy each other.
As we all know, though, sometimes misbehavior just happens.
Oh, does it happen. And no amount of proactivity can prevent it.
That’s when it’s time to connect. We have to ɹght the urge to
immediately punish, lecture, lay down the law, or even positively
redirect right away. Instead, we need to connect.
Why Connect First?
Let’s get more speciɹc and talk about why connection is so
powerful. We’ll look at three primary beneɹts—one short-term,
one long-term, and one relational—of making connection our ɹrst
response when our kids have trouble controlling themselves and
making good decisions.
Benefit #1: Connection Moves a Child from Reactivity to Receptivity
However we decide to speciɹcally respond when our children
misbehave, there’s one thing we have to do: we must remain
emotionally connected with them, even when—and perhaps
especially when—we discipline. After all, it’s when our kids are most
upset that they need us the most. Think about it: they don’t want to
feel frustrated, enraged, or out of control. That’s not only
unpleasant, it’s extremely stressful. Usually misbehavior is the
result of a child having a hard time dealing with what’s going on
around her—and inside her. She’s got all these big feelings she
doesn’t yet have the capacity to manage, and the misbehavior is
simply the result. Her actions—especially when she’s out of control
—are a message that she needs help. They are a bid for assistance,
and for connection.
So when children feel furious, dejected, ashamed, embarrassed,
overwhelmed, or out of control in any other way, that’s when we
need to be there for them. Through connection, we can soothe their
internal storm, help them calm down, and assist them in making
better decisions. When they feel our love and acceptance, when
they “feel felt” by us, even when they know we don’t like their
actions (or they don’t like ours), they can begin to regain control
and allow their upstairs brains to engage again. When that happens,
eʃective discipline can actually take place. Connection, in other
words, moves them out of a reactive state and into a state where
they can be more receptive to the lesson we want to teach and to
the healthy interactions we want to share with them.
So there’s a great question we can ask ourselves before we begin
redirecting and explicitly teaching: Is my child ready? Ready to hear
me, ready to learn, ready to understand? If a child isn’t ready, then
more connection is most likely in order.
As we saw with Michael and his ɹve-year-old, connection calms
the nervous system, soothing children’s reactivity in the moment
and moving them toward a place where they can hear us, learn,
and even make their own Whole-Brain decisions. When the
emotional gauge gets turned up, connection is the modulator that
keeps the feelings from getting too high. Without connection,
emotions can continue to spiral out of control.
Imagine the last time you felt really sad or angry or upset. How
would it have felt if someone you love told you,
“You need to calm
down,
” or “It’s not that big a deal”? Or what if you were told to
“go be by yourself until you’re calm and ready to be nice and
happy”? These responses would feel awful, wouldn’t they? Yet
these are the kinds of things we tell our kids all the time. When we
do, we actually increase their internal distress, leading to more
acting out, not less. These responses accomplish the opposite of
connection, effectively amplifying negative states.
Connection, on the other hand, calms, allowing children to begin
to regain control of their emotions and bodies. It allows them to
“feel felt,
” and this empathy soothes the sense of isolation or being
misunderstood that arises with the reactivity of their downstairs
brain and the whole nervous system: heart pounding, lungs rapidly
breathing, muscles tightening, and intestines churning. Those
reactive states are uncomfortable, and they can become intensiɹed
with further demands and disconnection. With connection,
however, kids can make more thoughtful choices and handle
themselves better.
What connection does, essentially, is to integrate the brain. Here’s
how it works. The brain, as we’ve said, is complex. (That’s the
third Brain C.) It’s made up of many parts, all of which have
diʃerent jobs to do. The upstairs brain, the downstairs brain. The
left side and the right side. There are memory centers and pain
regions. Along with all the systems and circuitry of the brain, these
parts of our brain have their own responsibilities, their own jobs to
do. When they work together as a coordinated whole, the brain
becomes integrated. Its many parts can perform as a team,
accomplishing more and being more eʃective than they could
working on their own.
As we explained in The Whole-Brain Child, a good image to help
understand integration is a river of well-being. Imagine you’re in a
canoe, ɻoating along in a peaceful, idyllic river. You feel calm,
relaxed, and ready to deal with whatever comes along. It’s not
necessarily that everything’s perfect or going your way. It’s more
that you’re in an integrated state of mind—you’re calm, receptive,
and balanced, and your body feels energetic and at ease. Even
when things don’t work out the way you’d like, you can ɻexibly
adapt. That’s the river of well-being.
Sometimes, though, you’re not able to stay in the ɻow of the
river. You veer too far to one bank or the other. One side of the
river represents chaos. Near this bank are dangerous rapids that
make life feel frenzied and unmanageable. When you’re near the
chaos bank, you’re easily upset, and even minor obstacles can leave
you spinning out of control. You might experience overwhelming
emotions such as high anxiety or intense anger, and you might
notice that your body feels chaotic, too, with tense muscles, a rapid
heartbeat, and a furrowed brow.
The other bank is no less unpleasant, because it represents
rigidity. Here you get stuck desiring or expecting the world to
operate in one particular way, and you’re unwilling or unable to
adapt when it doesn’t. In your eʃort to impose your own vision
and desires on the world around you, you ɹnd that you won’t, or
possibly even can’t, compromise or negotiate in any meaningful
way.
So chaos is on one bank, rigidity on the other. The two extremes
oʃer either a lack of control or so much control that there’s no
ɻexibility or adaptability. And both extremes keep you out of the
peaceful ɻow of the river of well-being. Whether you’re chaotic or
rigid, you’re missing out on the opportunity to enjoy mental and
emotional health, to feel at ease with the world.
Think about the river of well-being in relation to your kids.
Almost always, when children act up or feel upset, they will
display evidence of chaos, rigidity, or both. When a nine-year-old
freaks out about an oral presentation at school the next day and
ends up ripping up her notes as she sobs that she’ll never be able to
memorize her opening, she’s succumbed to chaos. She’s crashed
into the bank, far from the smooth-ɻowing river of well-being.
Similarly, when a ɹve-year-old stubbornly insists on another
bedtime story or refuses to get in the tub until he ɹnds his most
special wristband, he’s right up against the rigidity bank. And
remember Nina from the last chapter? When she fell apart because
her mom told her that her dad would be driving her to school that
morning, then refused to consider any alternative perspectives on
the situation, she was zigzagging back and forth between chaos and
rigidity, never getting to enjoy the peaceful ɻow in the center of
the river of well-being.
So that’s what connection does. It moves children away from the
banks and back into the ɻow, where they experience an internal
sense of balance and feel happier and more stable. Then they can
hear what we need to tell them, and they can make better
decisions. When we connect with a child who feels overwhelmed
and chaotic, we help move her away from that bank and into the
center of the river, where she can feel more balanced and in
control. When we connect with a child who’s stuck in a rigid frame
of mind, unable to consider alternative perspectives, we help him
integrate so that he can loosen his unyielding grip on a situation
and become more ɻexible and adaptive. In both cases, connection
creates an integrated state of mind, and the opportunity for
learning.
We’ll get much more speciɹc in the next chapter about practical
ways to connect with your children when they’re upset. The basic
approach, though, usually entails listening and providing lots of
verbal and nonverbal empathy. This is how we attune to our
children, tuning in to the inner life of their mind—to their feelings
and thoughts, to their perceptions and memories, to what has inner
subjective meaning in their lives. This is tuning in to the mind
beneath their behavior. For example, one of the most powerful ways
we connect with our children is simply by physically touching
them. A loving touch—as simple as a hand on an arm or a rub on
the back or a warm embrace—releases feel-good hormones (like
natural oxytocin and opioids) into our brain and body, and
decreases the level of our stress hormone (cortisol). When your
children are feeling upset, a loving touch can calm things down and
help you connect, even during moments of high stress. This is
connecting with their inner distress, not simply reacting to their
outwardly visible behavior.
Notice that this was the ɹrst thing Michael did when he looked
at his young son in the middle of the Lego carnage: he sat down
and held him.
In doing so, he began to pull Matthias’s tiny canoe away from
the bank of chaos and back into the peaceful ɻow of the river.
Then he listened. Matthias didn’t need to say much: “I spilt the
Legos.” With that he could begin to move on. Sometimes children
will need to talk much more, and to be listened to for much longer.
Or sometimes they don’t want to talk. And sometimes it can be as
quick as it was here. Nonverbal touch, an empathic statement—“I
know, buddy”—and a willingness to listen. That’s what Matthias
needed in order to return some equilibrium to his young brain and
impulsive body. Once that happened, his father could begin to
teach him by talking about the lessons at hand.
Even though Michael wasn’t thinking in these terms, what he
was doing was using his relationship, his connecting
communication, to help bring integration to Matthias’s brain, so
that his upstairs brain and his downstairs brain could work
together, and so that the right and left sides of his brain could work
together. When Matthias became furious with the older boys, his
downstairs brain completely took over, disabling his upstairs brain.
The instinctive, reactive lower parts of his brain became so active
that he lost access to the higher parts of the brain, the ones that
help him think about consequences and consider others’ feelings.
These two parts of his brain were not working together. In other
words, his brain in that moment was dis-integrated, and the result
was the Lego massacre. By oʃering a nonverbal gesture instead of
just a bunch of logical, left-brained words, Michael was able to
connect with Matthias’s right brain, the side more directly
connected to and also ɻooded by the downstairs brain. Right and
left, downstairs and upstairs, Matthias’s brain was ready to become
more coordinated and balanced in its movement toward
integration. Connection integrated his emotion-focused downstairs
brain and his thinking-oriented upstairs brain and allowed Michael
to achieve the short-term goal of gaining cooperation from his son.
Benefit #2: Connection Builds the Brain
As we explained in the previous chapter, No-Drama Discipline
builds the brain of a child by improving his capacity for
relationships, self-control, empathy, personal insight, and much
more. We discussed the importance of setting limits, creating
structure, and helping children build internal controls and impulse
inhibition by internalizing “no.” This is how we use our
relationship with our children to build their brains’ executive
functions. We also discussed other ways to develop a child’s
relational and decision-making abilities. Each interaction with our
kids oʃers the opportunity to build their brains and further their
capacity to be the kind of people we hope they’ll be.
And it all begins with connection. In addition to the short-term
beneɹt of moving them from reactivity to receptivity, connecting
during a disciplinary interaction also impacts children’s brains in
ways that will have long-term eʃects as they grow up. When we
oʃer comfort when our kids are upset, when we listen to their
feelings, when we communicate how much we love them even
when they’ve messed up: when we respond in these ways, we
signiɹcantly impact the way their brains develop and the kind of
people they’ll be, both now and as they move into adolescence and
adulthood.
In upcoming chapters we’ll talk more about redirection,
including the explicit lessons we teach and the behaviors we model
as we interact with our children. Obviously, a child’s brain will be
greatly impacted by what we communicate to him when we
respond to misbehavior. And it will also be changed by what we
model with our own actions in the moment. Whether consciously
or subconsciously, a child’s brain will assimilate all kinds of
information based on the parental response to any situation. The
more pertinent point here is about connection, and how parents
change and even build children’s brains based on what children
experience in that disciplinary moment.
To put it in more neurological terms, connection strengthens the
connective ɹbers between the upstairs and downstairs brain so that
the higher parts of the brain can more eʃectively communicate
with and override the lower, more primitive impulses. We
nickname these ɹbers connecting upper and lower brain areas the
“staircase of the brain.” The staircase integrates upstairs and
downstairs and beneɹts the region of the brain called the
prefrontal cortex. This key area of the brain helps create the
executive functions of self-regulation, including balancing our
emotions, focusing our attention, controlling our impulses, and
connecting us empathically with others. As the prefrontal cortex
develops, children will be better able to put into practice the social
and emotional skills we want them to develop and ultimately to
master as they move through our home and out into the larger
world.
To put it simply, integration in a relationship creates integration
in the brain. An integrated relationship develops when we honor
diʃerences between ourselves and others, and then connect
through compassionate communication. We empathize with
another person, feeling their feelings and understanding their point
of view. In this connection, we respect another person’s inner
mental life but do not become the other person. This is how we
remain diʃerentiated individuals but also connect. Such integration
creates harmony in a relationship. Amazingly, interpersonal
integration can also be seen at the heart of how parent-child
relationships cultivate integration in the child’s brain. This is how
diʃerentiated regions—like left and right, or up and down—remain
unique and specialized but also become linked. Regulation in the
brain depends upon the coordination and balance of various regions
that emerge from integration. And such neural integration is the
basis for executive functions, the capacity to regulate attention,
emotions, thoughts, and behavior. That’s the secret of the sauce!
Interpersonal integration cultivates internal neural integration!
So that’s the long-term beneɹt of connection: through
relationships, it creates neural linkages and grows integrative ɹbers
that literally change the brain and leave our kids more skilled at
making good decisions, participating in relationships, and
interacting successfully with their world.
Benefit #3: Connection Deepens the Relationship with Your Child
So connection oʃers the short-term beneɹt of moving kids from
reactivity to receptivity, and the long-term beneɹt of building the
brain. The third beneɹt we want to highlight is a relational one:
connection deepens the bond between you and your child.
Moments of conɻict can be the most diɽcult and precarious
times in any relationship. They can also be among the most
important. Of course our kids know we’re there for them when
we’re snuggling and reading a book together, or when we show up
and cheer at their performances. But what about when tension and
conɻict arise? When we have incompatible desires or opinions?
These moments are the real test. How we respond to our children
when we’re not happy with their choices—with loving guidance?
with irritation and criticism? with fury and a shaming outburst?—
will impact the development of our relationship with them, and
even their own sense of self.
It’s not always easy to even want to connect when our kids
misbehave, or when they’re acting their ugliest and most out of
control. Connecting might be the last thing in the world you want
to do when a ɹght breaks out between your kids on a quiet
airplane, or when they whine and complain about not getting a
better treat after you’ve just taken them to the movies.
But connection should be our ɹrst response in virtually any
disciplinary situation. Not only because it can help us deal with the
problem in the short term. Not only because it will make our
children better people in the long term. But also, and most
important, because it helps us communicate how much we value
the relationship. We know that our children have changing,
changeable, and complex brains, and that they need us when
they’re struggling. The more we respond with empathy, support,
and listening, the better it will be for our relationship with them.
Tina recently attended a birthday party with her six-year-old at
his friend Sabrina’s house. Her parents, Bassil and Kimberly,
walked the guests out at the end of the party. When they returned
to the living room of the house, they were met with a surprise.
Here’s how Kimberly put it in an email to Tina:
After the party, Sabrina went into the house and opened
all of her gifts unsupervised. So I couldn’t write down
who gave her what. It was pandemonium! I managed to
piece together most of the items because my daughter
Sierra had been there when she opened them. Before
Sabrina writes out the thank-you cards, I’d like to get
this clarified. Did JP get her the kaleidoscope chalk? I’m
sure Miss Manners would disapprove of my tactics, but
I’d rather get it right than be nonspecific!
In this situation, we could certainly empathize with a tired
parent for not handling herself well when she returned to the living
room to ɹnd recently opened toys everywhere and torn wrapping
paper littering the entire ɻoor. After all, Kimberly had just hosted
a fun but loud, entertaining but chaotic birthday party for ɹfteen
six-year-olds and their parents and siblings. The circumstances were
ripe for a parental meltdown, highlighted by lots of yelling about a
spoiled kid who couldn’t even wait until the party was over before
ripping into the presents like a wild animal tearing into meat.
By maintaining her own self-control, though, Kimberly was able
to address the situation from a No-Drama, Whole-Brain frame of
mind, which led her to begin with—you guessed it—connection.
Rather than launching into a lecture or a tirade, she connected with
her daughter. She ɹrst acknowledged how fun it was to have had
the party, and now to get to open all of the presents. She even sat
patiently as Sabrina showed her the set of fake moustaches she was
so excited about. (You’d have to know Sabrina.) And then, once
Kimberly had connected, she spoke with her daughter, teaching her
what she wanted her to know about presents and waiting and
thank-you notes. That’s how connection created an integrative
opportunity, building a stronger brain and strengthening a
relationship.
Will you be able to connect ɹrst every time your kids mess up or
lose control of themselves? Of course not. We certainly don’t with
our own kids. But the more frequently we can make connection our
ɹrst response, regardless of what our children have done, or
whether or not we ourselves are in the river of well-being, the
more we’ll show our kids that they can count on us to oʃer solace,
unconditional love, and support, even when they’ve acted in ways
we don’t like. Talk about fortifying and deepening a relationship!
What’s more, in strengthening your own relationship with your
children, you’ll be better equipping them to be good siblings,
friends, and partners as they move toward adulthood. You’ll be
teaching by role modeling, guiding by what you do and not only by
what you say. That’s the relational beneɹt of connection: it teaches
kids what it means to be in a relationship and to love, even when
we’re not happy with the choices made by the person we love.
What About Tantrums? Aren’t We Supposed to Ignore Them?
When we teach parents about connecting and redirecting, one of
the most common questions we hear is about tantrums. Usually
someone in the audience will ask something like,
“I thought we
were supposed to ignore tantrums. Doesn’t connecting with a kid
when he’s freaking out just give him attention? So doesn’t that just
reinforce the negative behavior?”
Our response to this question reveals another place where the
No-Drama, Whole-Brain philosophy deviates from conventional
approaches. Yes, there may be times when a child throws what we
might call a strategic tantrum, when he’s in control of himself and
is willfully acting distressed to achieve a desired end: to get a toy
he wants, to stay at the park longer, and so on. But with most
children, and almost always with young children, strategic
tantrums are much, much more the exception than the rule.
The vast majority of the time, a tantrum is evidence that a
child’s downstairs brain has hijacked his upstairs brain and left him
legitimately and honestly out of control. Or, even if the child isn’t
fully dysregulated, he’s enough out of sorts in his nervous system
that he whines or doesn’t have the capacity to be ɻexible and
manage his feelings in that moment. And if a child is unable to
regulate his emotions and actions, our response should be to oʃer
help and emphasize comfort. We should be nurturing and empathic,
and focus on connection. Whether he’s out of sorts and just
beginning to move down the road to distress or so upset that he’s
actually out of control, he needs us in this moment. We still need to
set limits—we can’t let a child, in his distress, yank down the
curtains at the restaurant—but our objective in that moment is to
comfort him and help him calm down so he can regain control of
himself. Recall that chaos and losing control are signs of blocked
integration, where the diʃerent parts of the brain are not working
as a coordinated whole. And since connection creates integrative
opportunities, connection becomes the way we comfort.
Integration creates the ability to regulate emotions—and that’s how
we soothe our kids, helping them move from the chaos or rigidity
of non-integrated states to the calmer and clearer harmony of
integration and well-being.
So when parents ask for our opinion on tantrums, our response is
that we need to completely reframe the way we think about the
times our kids are the most upset and out of control. We suggest
that parents view a tantrum not merely as an unpleasant
experience they have to learn to get through, manage for their own
beneɹt, or stop as soon as possible at all costs, but instead as a plea
for help—as another opportunity to make a child feel safe and
loved. It’s a chance to soothe distress, to be a haven when an
internal storm is raging, to practice moving from a state of dis-
integration into a state of integration, through connection. That’s
why we call these moments of connection “integrative
opportunities.” Remember that a child’s repeated experience of
having her caregiver be emotionally responsive and attuned to her
—connect with her—builds her brain’s ability to self-regulate and
self-soothe over time, leading to more independence and resilience.
So a No-Drama response to a tantrum begins with parental
empathy. When we understand why children have tantrums—that
their young, developing brains are subject to becoming disintegrated as their big emotions take over—then we’re going to
oʃer a much more compassionate response when the screaming,
yelling, and kicking begin. It doesn’t mean we’ll ever enjoy a
child’s tantrum—if you do, you might consider seeking professional
help—but viewing it with empathy and compassion will lead to
much greater calm and connection than seeing it as evidence of the
child simply being difficult or manipulative or naughty.
That’s why we’re not at all fans of the conventional approach
that calls for parents to completely ignore a tantrum. We agree
with the notion that a tantrum is not the time to explain to a child
that she’s acting inappropriately. A child in the midst of a tantrum
is not experiencing what is traditionally called a “teachable
moment.” But the moment can be transformed through connection
into an integrative opportunity. Parents tend to overtalk in general
when their kids are upset, and asking questions and trying to teach
a lesson mid-tantrum can further escalate their emotions. Their
nervous systems are already overloaded, and the more we talk, the
more we flood their systems with additional sensory input.
But that fact doesn’t at all logically lead to the conclusion that
we should ignore our children when they’re distraught. In fact,
we’re encouraging pretty much the opposite response. Ignoring a
child in the midst of a tantrum is one of the worst things we can
do, because when a child is that upset, he’s actually suʃering. He is
miserable. The stress hormone cortisol is pumping through his body
and washing over his brain, and he feels completely out of control
of his emotions and impulses, unable to calm himself or express
what he needs. That’s suʃering. And just like our kids need us to be
with them and provide reassurance and comfort when they’re physically
hurting, they need the same thing when they’re suʃering emotionally.
They need us to be calm and loving and nurturing. They need us to
connect.
We know how unpleasant a tantrum can be. Believe us, we
know. But here’s what it really comes down to. What message do
you want to send your children?
When you deliver this second message, you’re not giving in.
You’re not being permissive. It doesn’t mean you have to let a child
harm himself, destroy things, or put others at risk. You can, and
should, still set boundaries. You may even have to help him control
his body or stop an impulse during a tantrum. (We’ll oʃer speciɹc
suggestions for doing so in the coming chapters.) But you set these
limits while communicating your love and walking through the diɽcult
moment with your child, always communicating,
“I’m here.”
Of course we want the tantrum to resolve as quickly as possible,
just like we want to get out of the dentist chair as soon as we can.
It’s simply not pleasant. But if you’re working from a Whole-Brain
perspective, the quickest ending to the tantrum is really not your
primary goal. Rather, your ɹrst objective is to be emotionally
responsive and present for your child. Your primary goal is to
connect—which will oʃer all the short-term, long-term, and
relational beneɹts we’ve been discussing. In other words, even
though you want the tantrum to end as soon as possible, the larger
goal of connecting actually gets you there a lot more eɽciently in
the short run, and achieves a whole lot more in the long run. You’ll
make things easier and less dramatic for both your child and
yourself by providing empathy and your calm presence during a
tantrum, and you’ll build your child’s capacity to handle himself
better in the future, because emotional responsiveness strengthens
the integrative connections in his brain that allow him to make
better choices, control his body and emotions, and think about
others.
How Do You Connect Without Spoiling a Child?
We’ve said that connection defuses conɻict, builds a child’s brain,
and strengthens the parent-child relationship. One question parents
often raise, though, has to do with a potential drawback of
connecting before redirecting: “If I’m always connecting when my
kids do something wrong, won’t I spoil them? In other words,
won’t that reinforce the behavior that I’m trying to change?”
These reasonable questions are based on a misunderstanding, so
let’s take a few moments and discuss what spoiling is, and what it’s
not. Then we can be more clear on why connecting during
discipline is quite different from spoiling a child.
Let’s start with what spoiling is not. Spoiling is not about how
much love and time and attention you give your kids. You can’t spoil
your children by giving them too much of yourself. In the same way,
you can’t spoil a baby by holding her too much or responding to
her needs each time she expresses them. Parenting authorities at
one time told parents not to pick up their babies too much for fear
of spoiling them. We now know better. Responding to and soothing
a child does not spoil her—but not responding to or soothing her
creates a child who is insecurely attached and anxious. Nurturing
your relationship with your child and giving her the consistent
experiences that form the basis of her accurate belief that she’s
entitled to your love and aʃection is exactly what we should be
doing. In other words, we want to let our kids know that they can
count on getting their needs met.
Spoiling, on the other hand, occurs when parents (or other
caregivers) create their child’s world in such a way that the child
feels a sense of entitlement about getting her way, about getting
what she wants exactly when she wants it, and that everything
should come easily to her and be done for her. We want our kids to
expect that their needs can be understood and consistently met. But
we don’t want our kids to expect that their desires and whims will
always be met. (To paraphrase the Rolling Stones, we want our
kids to know they’ll get what they need, even if they can’t always
get what they want!) And connecting when a child is upset or out
of control is about meeting that child’s needs, not giving in to what
she wants.
The dictionary deɹnition of “spoil” is “to ruin or do harm to the
character or attitude by overindulgence or excessive praise.”
Spoiling can of course occur when we give our kids too much stuʃ,
spend too much money on them, or say yes all the time. But it also
occurs when we give children the sense that the world and people
around them will serve their whims.
Is the current generation of parents more likely to spoil their
kids than previous generations? Quite possibly. We see this most
commonly when parents shelter their children from having to
struggle at all. They overprotect them from disappointments or
diɽculties. Parents often confuse indulgence, on one hand, with
love and connection, on the other. If parents themselves were
raised by parents who weren’t emotionally responsive and
aʃectionate, they often experience a well-meaning desire to do
things diʃerently with their own kids. The problem appears when
they indulge their children by giving them more and more stuʃ, and
sheltering them from struggles and sadness, instead of lavishly oʃering
what their kids really need, and what really matters—their love and
connection and attention and time—as their children struggle and face
the frustrations that life inevitably brings.
There’s a reason we worry about spoiling our kids by giving
them too much stuʃ. When kids are given whatever they want all
the time, they lose opportunities to build resilience and learn
important life lessons: about delaying gratiɹcation, about having to
work for something, about dealing with disappointment. Having a
sense of entitlement, as opposed to an attitude of gratitude, can
aʃect relationships in the future, when the entitled mind-set comes
across to others.
We also want to give our children the gift of learning to work
through diɽcult experiences. We’re doing our child no favor when
we ɹnd his unɹnished homework on the kitchen table and
complete it ourselves before running it up to school to protect him
from facing the natural consequences of a late assignment. Or when
we call another parent to ask for an invitation to a birthday party
that our child caught wind of but was not invited to. These
responses create an expectation in children that they’ll experience a
pain-free existence, and as a result, they may be unable to handle
themselves when life doesn’t turn out as they anticipated.
Another problematic result of spoiling is that it chooses
immediate gratiɹcation—for both child and parent—over what’s
best for the child. Sometimes we overindulge or decide not to set a
limit because it’s easier in the moment. Saying yes to that second
or third treat of the day might be easier in the short term because
it avoids a meltdown. But what about tomorrow? Will treats be
expected then as well? Remember, the brain makes associations
from all of our experiences. Spoiling ultimately makes life harder
on us as parents because we’re constantly having to deal with the
demands or the meltdowns that result when our kids don’t get
what they’ve come to expect: that they’ll get their way all the time.
Spoiled children often grow up to be unhappy because people in
the real world don’t respond to their every whim. They have a
harder time appreciating the smaller joys and the triumph of
creating their own world if others have always done it for them.
True conɹdence and competence come not from succeeding at
getting what we want, but from our actual accomplishments and
achieving mastery of something on our own. Further, if a child
hasn’t had practice dealing with the emotions that come with not
getting what she wants and then adapting her attitude and
comforting herself, it’s going to be quite diɽcult to do so later
when disappointments get bigger. (In Chapter 6, by the way, we’ll
discuss some strategies for dialing back the eʃects of spoiling if
we’ve gotten into that unhelpful habit.)
What we’re saying is that parents are right to worry about spoiling
their kids. Overindulgence is unhelpful for children, unhelpful for
parents, and unhelpful for the relationship. But spoiling has nothing to
do with connecting with your child when he’s upset or making bad
choices. Remember, you can’t spoil a child by giving him too much
emotional connection, attention, physical aʃection, or love. When our
children need us, we need to be there for them.
Connection, in other words, isn’t about spoiling children,
coddling them, or inhibiting their independence. When we call for
connection, we’re not endorsing what’s become known as
helicopter parenting, where parents hover over their children’s
lives, shielding them from all struggle and sadness. Connection isn’t
about rescuing kids from adversity. Connection is about walking
through the hard times with our children and being there for them when
they’re emotionally suʃering, just like we would if they scraped their
knee and were physically suʃering. In doing so, we’re actually
building independence, because when our children feel safe and
connected, and when we’ve helped them build relational and
emotional skills by disciplining from a Whole-Brain perspective,
they’ll feel more and more ready to take on whatever life throws
their way.
You Can Connect While Also Setting Limits
So yes, as we discipline our children, we want to connect with
them emotionally and make sure they know we’re there for them
when they’re having a hard time. But no, this doesn’t at all mean
we should indulge their every whim. In fact, it would be not only
indulgent but irresponsible if your child were crying and
tantruming at the toy store because she didn’t want to leave, and
you allowed her to keep screaming and throwing anything she
could get her hands on.
You’re not doing a child any favors when you remove boundaries
from her life. It doesn’t feel good to her (or to you or the other
people in the toy store) to allow her emotional explosion to go
unfettered. When we talk about connecting with a child who’s
struggling to control herself, we don’t mean you allow her to
behave however she chooses. You wouldn’t simply say “You seem
upset” to a child as he hurls a Bart Simpson action ɹgure toward a
breakable Hello Kitty alarm clock. A more appropriate response
would be to say something like,
“I can see that you’re upset and
you’re having a hard time stopping your body. I will help you.”
You might need to gently pick him up or guide him outside as you
continue to connect—using empathy and physical touch,
remembering that he’s needing you—until he’s calm. Once he’s
more in control of himself and in a state of mind that’s receptive to
learning, then you can discuss what happened with him.
Notice the diʃerence in the two responses. One (“You seem
upset”) allows the child’s impulses to hold everyone captive,
leaving him unaware of what the limits are, and doesn’t give him
the experience of putting on the brakes when his desires are
pressing the gas pedal. The other gives him practice at learning that
there are limits on what he can and can’t do. Kids need to feel that
we care about what they’re going through, but they also need us to
provide rules and boundaries that allow them to know what’s
expected in a given environment.

When Dan’s children were small he took them to a neighborhood
park where he witnessed a four- or ɹve-year-old boy being bossy
and too rough with the children around him, some of them quite
little. The boy’s mother chose not to intervene, ostensibly because
she’d “rather not solve his problems for him.” Eventually another
mom let her know that the boy was being rough and preventing
children from using the slide, at which time his mother harshly
reprimanded him from across the way: “Brian! Let those kids slide
or we’re going home!” In response, he told her that she was stupid
and began throwing sand. She said,
“OK, we’re going,
” and began
gathering up their things, but he refused to leave. The mom kept
making threats but took no action. When Dan left with his kids ten
minutes later, the mom and her son were still there.
This situation raises a question about what we mean when we
talk about connecting. In this case, the issue at hand wasn’t that the
b o y was upset and crying. He was still having a hard time
regulating his impulses and handling the situation, but it was
expressed more in stubborn and oppositional behavior. Still,
connection was in order before his mother attempted to redirect
him. When a child isn’t overwhelmed by emotions but is simply
making less-than-optimal decisions, connection might mean
acknowledging how he’s feeling in that moment. She could walk
over and say,
“It looks like you’re having fun deciding who gets to
use the slide. Tell me more about what you and your friends are
doing here.”
A simple statement like this, said in a tone that communicates
interest and curiosity instead of judgment and anger, establishes an
emotional connection between the two of them. The boy’s mother
can then more credibly follow up with her redirection, which might
express the same sentiment she used earlier, but do so in a very
diʃerent tone. Depending on her own personality and her son’s
temperament, she could say something like,
“Hmmm. I just heard
from another mom that some of the kids are wanting to use the
slide, and that they’re not liking how you’re blocking it. The slide
is for all the kids at the park. Do you have any ideas for how we
can all share it?”
In a good moment, he might say something like,
“I know! I’ll go
down and then run around and they can go down while I’m
climbing back up.” In a not-so-generous moment, he might refuse,
at which time the mother might need to say,
“If it’s too hard to use
the slide in a way that works for you and your friends, then we’ll
need to do something different, like throwing the Frisbee.”
With these types of statements, the mother would be attuning to
his emotional state, while still enforcing boundaries that teach that
we need to be considerate of others. She could even give him a
second chance if need be. But if he then refused to comply and
began hurling more insults and more sand, she would have to
follow through on the redirection she promised: “I can see you’re
really angry and disappointed about leaving the park. But we can’t
stay because you’re having a hard time making good choices right
now. Would you like to walk to the car? Or I can carry you there.
It’s your choice.” Then she’d need to make it happen.
So yes, we want to always connect with our children
emotionally.
But along with connecting, we must help kids make good choices
and respect boundaries, as we clearly communicate and hold the
limits. It’s what children need, and even what they want,
ultimately. Again, they don’t feel good when their emotional states
hold them and everyone else hostage. It leaves them on the chaos
bank of the river, feeling out of control. We can help move their
brains back toward a state of integration and move them back into
the ɻow of the river by teaching them the rules that help them
understand how the world and relationships work. Giving parental
structure to our children’s emotional lives actually gives them a
sense of security and the freedom to feel.
We want our kids to learn that relationships ɻourish with
respect, nurturing, warmth, consideration, cooperation, and
compromise. So we want to interact with them from a perspective
that emphasizes both connections and boundary setting. In other
words, when we consistently pay attention to their internal world
while also holding to standards about their behavior, these are the
lessons they’ll learn. From parental sensitivity and structure
emerge a child’s resourcefulness, resilience, and relational ability.
Ultimately, then, kids need us to set boundaries and communicate
our expectations. But the key here is that all discipline should begin by
nurturing our children and attuning to their internal world, allowing
them to know that they are seen, heard, and loved by their parents—
even when they’ve done something wrong. When children feel seen,
safe, and soothed, they feel secure and they thrive. This is how we
can value our children’s minds while helping to shape and structure
their behavior. We can help guide a behavioral change, teach a new
skill, and impart an important way of approaching a problem, all
while valuing a child’s mind beneath the behavior. This is how we
discipline, how we teach, while nurturing a child’s sense of self and
sense of connection to us. Then they’ll interact with the world
around them based on these beliefs and with these social and
emotional skills, because their brains will be wired to expect that
their needs will be met and that they are unconditionally loved.


So the next time one of your children loses control or does
something that drives you completely crazy, remind yourself that a
child’s need to connect is greatest in times of high emotion. Yes,
you’ll need to address the behavior, to redirect and teach the
lessons. But ɹrst, reframe those big feelings and recognize them for
what they are: a bid for connection. When your child is at his worst,
that’s when he needs you the most. To connect is to share in your
child’s experience, to be present with him, to walk through this
diɽcult time with him. In doing so you help integrate his brain and
oʃer him the emotional regulation he’s unable to access on his
own. Then he can move back into the ɻow of the river of wellbeing. You will have helped him move from reactivity to
receptivity, helped build his brain, and deepened and strengthened
the relationship you two share.

CHAPTER 4
No-Drama Connection in Action
ina and her family were eating dinner at home one night when
she and her husband noticed that their six-year-old hadn’t
returned from the bathroom for several minutes. They found him
playing on Tina’s iPad in the living room. Here’s how Tina tells the
story:
At ɹrst I was frustrated because my six-year-old had
broken several of our rules. He had snuck away from
the table, and he had played on the iPad without asking.
He had also taken the iPad out of its protective case,
which he knew he wasn’t supposed to do. None of the
infractions was signiɹcant. The problem was that he
was disregarding the rules we had all agreed to.
First, I thought about my son, and his temperament
and developmental stage. As Dan and I have said
several times now, context always has to be taken into
consideration when deciding how to discipline. I knew
that because my son is a sensitive and conscientious
little guy, I probably wouldn’t need to say much to
discipline him.
Scott and I sat on the couch next to him, and I simply
said, in a curious tone,
“What happened here?”
Immediately, my son’s lower lip began to quiver, and
tears pooled in his eyes. “I just wanted to try
Minecraft!”
The nonverbal communication was a reɻection of his
inner conscience and his own discomfort, and the words
were an admission of guilt. Implicit in his statement
was the message,
“I know I wasn’t supposed to leave
the table and get the iPad, but I just wanted to play so
bad! My impulse was too strong.” By this moment, in
other words, I already knew that the redirection part of
our conversation wasn’t going to be too challenging. At
other times it is, but not now, when there was already
an awareness on his part.
Before redirecting, though, I wanted to meet him
where he was, and to connect with him emotionally. I
said,
“You really are interested in that game, aren’t
you? You’re curious about what the bigger boys are
playing?”
Scott followed my lead and said something about how
cool it is that the game allows you to create a whole
world full of buildings and tunnels and animals.
Our son sheepishly looked up at us, moving his eyes
from me to Scott, questioning whether things were
really OK among us all. Then he nodded and gave us a
soft smile.
With these few sentences and glances, connection had
been established. Scott and I could then redirect. And
again, knowing our son and recognizing where he was
at this moment, the situation didn’t require much from
us. Scott simply asked,
“But what about our rules?”
Here our son began to cry in earnest. Not much more
needed to be said because the lesson had already been
internalized.
I put my arm around him to comfort him. I said,
“I
know your choices tonight didn’t follow our rules. Is
there anything you’d do differently next time?”
He nodded as he cried, then promised to ask to be
excused before leaving the table next time. We hugged,
and then Scott asked him a Minecraft question, which
led him to explain to his dad something about a
trapdoor and a dungeon. As he became more animated,
he moved past his guilt and his tears, and we all
rejoined the rest of the family at the table. Connection
had led to redirection, meaning not only that teaching
could occur, but also that our son felt understood and
loved.
Setting the Stage for Connection: Response Flexibility
In the previous chapter we discussed connection as the ɹrst step of
the discipline process. Now we’ll focus on what that actually looks
like in action, recommending principles and strategies you can rely
on when your child is upset or misbehaving. Sometimes connection
is fairly simple, as it was here for Tina. Often, it’s much more
challenging.
As we discuss recommendations for connection, avoid the
temptation to look for the formulaic one-size-ɹts-all technique that
is supposed to apply in every situation. The following principles
and strategies are extremely eʃective most of the time. But you
should apply these approaches based on your own parenting style,
the situation at hand, and your individual child’s temperament. In
other words, maintain response flexibility.
Response ɻexibility means just what it sounds like—being
ɻexible about our response to a situation. It means pausing to think
and to choose the best course of action. It lets us separate stimulus
from response, so that our reaction doesn’t immediately (and
unintentionally) follow from a child’s behavior or our own internal
chaos. So when A happens, we don’t just automatically do B;
instead we consider B, C, or even a combo of D and E. Response
ɻexibility creates a space in time and in our minds that enables a
wide range of possibilities to be considered. As a result, we can just
“be” with an experience, if only for a few seconds, and reɻect
before engaging the “do” circuitry of action.
Response ɻexibility helps you choose to be your wisest self
possible in a diɽcult moment with your child, so that connection
can occur. It’s pretty much the opposite of autopilot discipline,
where you apply a robotic one-size-ɹts-all approach to every
scenario that arises. When we’re ɻexible in our responses to our
children’s state of mind and their misbehavior, we allow ourselves
to intentionally respond to a situation in the best way possible and
provide our kids with what they need in the moment.
Depending on your child’s infraction, this might require taking a
moment to calm down. It’s a good rule of thumb not to respond the
nanosecond after you witness a misbehavior. We know you may
feel, in the heat of the moment, like laying down the law, yelling
that since your daughter pushed her brother into the pool, she’s
done swimming for the rest of the summer. (Aren’t we ridiculous
sometimes?) But if you can take a few seconds and allow yourself
to calm down, rather than making a scene at the public pool and
overshooting the discipline mark, you’ll have a better chance at
intentionally responding out of a calmer and more thoughtful part
of yourself to what your child actually needs right then. (As a
bonus, you can avoid being the subject of dinner conversations all
around town that begin,
“You should’ve seen this crazy lady at the
pool today.”)
At other times, response ɻexibility may lead you to decide to
take a firmer stand on an issue than you normally might. If you
notice signs that your eleven-year-old is taking less initiative with
his responsibilities and his schoolwork, you might decide not to
drive him back to school so he can retrieve the book he (again!)
“has no idea how” he left in his locker. You would sincerely
empathize with him and make sure to connect—“It’s such a
bummer that you forgot your book and won’t have your
assignment ready tomorrow”—but you’d allow him to experience
the natural and logical fallout of his forgetfulness. Or maybe you
would take him to get his book, because his personality or the
context of the situation leads you to believe that approach would
be best. That’s the whole point. Response ɻexibility means you’re
making a point to decide how you want to respond to each
situation that arises, rather than simply reacting without thinking
about it.
Like so many aspects of parenting, response ɻexibility is
fundamentally about parenting intentionally. We’re talking about
remaining mindful of meeting the needs of your child—this
particular child—in this particular moment. When that goal is
central in your mind, connection will necessarily follow.
Now let’s look at some speciɹc ways you can use response
ɻexibility to connect with your kids when they’re having a hard
time handling themselves well or when they’re making unwise
decisions. We’ll start by focusing on three No-Drama connection
principles that set the stage and allow for connection between
parent and child. Then we’ll move to some more immediate in-themoment connection strategies.
Connection Principle #1: Turn Down the Shark Music
If you’ve heard Dan speak, you may have seen him introduce the
concept of shark music. Here’s how he explains the idea:
First, I ask the audience to monitor the response of their
bodies and minds as I show them a thirty-second
video.* On the screen, the audience sees what appears
to be a beautiful forest. From the point of view of the
person holding the camera, the audience sees a rustic
trail and moves down that path toward a beautiful
ocean. All the while, calm, classical-sounding piano
music plays, communicating a sense of peace and
serenity in an idyllic environment.
I then stop the video and ask the audience to watch it
again, explaining that I’m going to show them the exact
same video, but this time diʃerent music will play in
the background. The audience then sees the same
images—the forest, the rustic trail, the ocean. But the
soundtrack this time is dark and menacing. It’s like the
famous theme music from the movie Jaws, and it
completely colors the way the scene is perceived. The
peaceful scene now looks threatening—who knows
what might jump out?—and the path leads somewhere
we’re pretty sure we don’t want to go. There’s no telling
what we’ll ɹnd in the water at the end of the trail;
based on the music, it’s likely a shark. But despite our
fear, the camera continues to approach the water.
The exact same images, but as the audience discovers,
the experience drastically changes with diʃerent
background music. One soundtrack leads to peace and
serenity, the other to fear and dread.
It’s the same when we interact with our children. We have to
pay attention to our background music. “Shark music” takes us out
of the present moment, causing us to practice fear-based parenting.
Our attention is on whatever we are feeling reactive about. We
worry about what’s coming in the future, or we respond to
something from the past. When we do so, we miss what’s actually
happening in the moment—what our children really need, and
what they’re actually communicating. As a result, we don’t give
them our best. Shark music, in other words, keeps us from
parenting this individual child in this individual moment.
For instance, imagine that your fifth grader comes home with her
ɹrst progress report, which shows that, since she was sick and
missed a couple of days of class, her math average is lower than
you’d expect. Without shark music playing in the background, you
might just chalk this up to the absences, or to the more diɽcult
subject matter in ɹfth grade. You’d take steps to make sure she
understands the material now, and you might or might not decide
to visit with her teacher. In other words, you’d approach the
situation from a calm and rational perspective.
If, however, your daughter’s older brother is a ninth grader who
has shown himself to be less than responsible with his homework,
and who is struggling with the basics of algebra, this prior
experience might become shark music that plays in your mind as
your daughter shows you her progress report. “Here we go again”
might be the refrain that takes over your thoughts. So instead of
responding to the situation as you normally would, asking your
daughter how she feels about it and trying to ɹgure out what’s best
for her, you think about your son’s problems with algebra, and you
overreact to your daughter’s situation. You begin talking to her
about consequences, and cutting back on after-school activities. If
the shark music really gets to you, maybe you start lecturing about
getting into good colleges, and the chain of events that leads from a
couple of bad grades in ɹfth-grade math to problems in middle
school and high school and ɹnally to a slew of rejection letters
from universities all across the country. Before you know it, your
adorable ten-year-old has become a homeless woman pushing a
shopping cart toward the cardboard box she lives in under the
bridge down by the river—all because she got mixed up about
which way the “greater than” symbol points!
The key to a No-Drama response, as is so often the case, is
awareness. Once you recognize that shark music is blaring in your
mind, you can shift your state of mind and stop parenting based on
fear and on past experiences that don’t apply to the current
scenario you face. Instead, you can connect with your child, who
might be feeling discouraged. You can give her what she needs in
this moment: a parent who is fully present, parenting only her
based only on the actual facts of this particular situation—not on past
expectations or future fears. See illustrations on next page.
This isn’t to say that we don’t pay attention to patterns of
behavior over time. We can also get trapped in states of denial
where we overcontextualize behavior or explain away our kids’
repeated struggles with all kinds of excuses that keep us from
seeking intervention or from helping our children build the skills
they need. You’ve met the parent who has a child who is never at
fault and whom the parents never hold accountable. See
illustrations on next page.
When the “excuse ɻavor of the week” becomes a pattern of
parental response, then the parents are probably working from a
diʃerent kind of shark music. It’s similar to the parents whose
children were medically vulnerable as babies, whose shark music
now leads them to overdo for their kids, treating them as if they
are still more fragile than they actually are.




The point is that shark music can prevent us from parenting
intentionally and from being who our children need us to be at any
given moment. It makes us reactive instead of receptive.
Sometimes we’re called to adjust our expectations and realize that
our children just need more time for development to unfold; at
other times we need to adjust our expectations and realize that our
children are capable of more than we’re asking of them, so we can
challenge them to take more responsibility for their choices. At still
other times we need to pay attention to our own needs, desires,
and past experiences, any of which can override our ability to
make good moment-by-moment decisions. The problem is that
when we are reactive, we can’t receive input from others, or
demonstrate any response ɻexibility to consider the various
options in our own mind. (If you’d like to go deeper with this
concept, Dan covers it extensively in Parenting from the Inside Out,
co-authored with Mary Hartzell.)
Ultimately, our job is to give unconditional love and calm
presence to our kids even when they’re at their worst. Especially
when they’re at their worst. That’s how we stay receptive instead
of going reactive. And the perspective we take on their behavior
will necessarily aʃect how we respond to them. If we recognize
them for the still-developing young people they are, with changing,
changeable, complex young brains, then when they struggle or do
something we don’t like, we’ll be better able to be receptive and
hear the calming piano music. We’ll therefore interact with them in
a way that’s more likely to lead to peace and serenity.
Shark music, on the other hand, will take us out of the present
moment, and out of our right minds, as we become reactive. It will
fuel our internal chaos and lead us to make all kinds of
assumptions, to worry about all kinds of possibilities that simply
shouldn’t be considered in this particular situation. It might even
lead us to automatically assume that our kids are “acting out”
because they are selɹsh, lazy, spoiled, or whatever other label we
choose. Then we’ll respond not out of love and intentionality, but
out of reactivity, anger, anxiety, drama, and fear.
So the next time you need to discipline, pause for just a second
and listen for the soundtrack in your head. If you hear calm piano
music and feel capable of oʃering a loving, objective, clearheaded
response to the situation, then go ahead and oʃer just that kind of
response. But if you notice the shark music, be very careful about
what you do and say. Give yourself a minute—longer, if necessary
—before responding. Then, when you feel yourself letting go of the
fears, expectations, and bigger-than-necessary reactivity that keep
you from looking at the situation for what it really is, you can
respond. Simply by paying attention to whatever music is playing
in the background of a disciplinary moment, you’ll be much more
capable of responding flexibly instead of reacting rigidly or chaotically,
and oʃering your children what they need right then. Responding
rather than reacting is the key.
Connection Principle #2: Chase the Why
One of the worst by-products of shark music is the parental
tendency to make assumptions about what we perceive to be
obvious. If a scary or emotionally charged soundtrack is clouding
your mind when you interact with your children, you’re not likely
to be very objective about the reasons they’re behaving the way
they are. Instead, you’re probably going to simply react based on
information that might not be accurate at all. You’ll assume there’s
a shark swimming in the water or a monster hiding behind the tree,
even if there’s not one.
When your kids are playing in the next room and you hear your
younger child begin to cry, it may seem perfectly justiɹable to
march into the room, look at your older child, and demand,
“What
did you do this time?!” But when your younger child says,
“No,
Dad, I just fell and hurt my knee,
” you realize that what seemed
obvious wasn’t accurate at all, and that shark music has (once
again) led you astray. Because your older child has played too
rough in the past, you assumed that was the case this time.
Few parental actions will hinder connection faster than assuming
the worst and reacting accordingly. So instead of making
assumptions and operating on information that may be faulty,
question what seems obvious. Become a detective. Put on your
Sherlock Holmes hat. You know, Sherlock Holmes: the Arthur
Conan Doyle character who declared,
“It is a capital mistake to
theorize before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to
suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts.”
When dealing with our children, it’s dangerous to theorize before
we have data. Instead, we need to be curious. We need to “chase
the why.”
Curiosity is the cornerstone of eʃective discipline. Before you
ever respond to your child’s behavior—especially when you don’t
like it—ask yourself a question: “I wonder why my child did that.”
Let this lead you to other questions: “What is she wanting here? Is
she asking for something? Trying to discover something? What is
she communicating?”
When a child acts in a way we don’t like, the temptation will be
to ask,
“How could she do this?” Instead, chase the why. When you
walk into the bathroom and see that your four-year-old has
“decorated” the sink and mirror with wet toilet paper and a lipstick
she found in a drawer, be curious. It’s ɹne to be frustrated. But as
quickly as possible, chase the why. Let your curiosity replace the
frustration you feel. Talk to your daughter, and ask her what
happened. Most likely you’ll hear something that’s totally
plausible, at least from her perspective, and probably hilarious.
The bad news is that you’ll still have to clean up the mess
(preferably with the help of your daughter). The good news is that
you will have allowed your curiosity to lead you to a much more
accurate—and fun, interesting, and honest—answer about your
child’s behavior.
The same would apply when your second grader’s teacher calls
to discuss certain “impulse control” problems your son is
displaying. She tells you he’s not respecting authority because he
has begun making noises and inappropriate comments during class
reading time. Your ɹrst reaction might be to initiate a “That’s not
the way we behave, mister” conversation with your son. But if you
chase the why and ask him about his motivation, you might
discover that “Truman thinks I’m funny when I do that, and now he
lets me stand by him in the lunch line.” You’ll still need to do some
redirecting, and work with your son on appropriate ways to
navigate the diɽcult world of playground politics, but this way
you’ll be able to do so with much more accurate information about
your son’s emotional needs and what’s actually driving his actions.
Chasing the why doesn’t mean that we should necessarily ask our
children “Why did you do that?” every time a disciplinary situation
arises. In fact, that question may imply immediate judgment or
disapproval, rather than curiosity. Further, sometimes children,
especially young ones, may not know why they are upset or why
they did what they did. Their personal insight and awareness of
their own goals and motivations may not be very skilled yet. That’s
why we’re not advising you to ask the why. We’re recommending
that you chase the why. That’s more about asking the why question
in your own mind, allowing yourself to be curious, and wondering
where your child is coming from in this moment.

Sometimes the behavior we want to address won’t be as benign
as lipstick decorations and potty humor. Sometimes our child will
make decisions that lead to broken objects, bruised bodies, and
damaged relationships. In these cases it’s all the more important
that we chase the why. We need to be curious about what drove
our child to throw the screwdriver in anger, to strike another child,
to spit out venomous words. It’s not enough simply to address the
behavior. Human behavior is purpose-driven most of the time. We
need to know what’s behind it, what’s causing it. If we focus only
on our child’s behavior (her external world) and neglect the
reasons behind that behavior (her internal world), then we’ll
concentrate only on the symptoms, not the cause that’s producing
them. And if we consider only the symptoms, we’ll have to keep
treating those symptoms over and over again.
But if we put on our Sherlock Holmes hat and chase the why,
curiously looking for the root cause behind the behavior, we can
more fully discover what’s really going on with our child. We
might ɹnd real reasons for concern that need to be addressed.
Maybe we’ll learn that our assumptions were false. Or maybe we’ll
discover that this “bad behavior” is an adaptive response to
something that’s too challenging for the child. Perhaps, for
example, your child is faking an illness each day before PE class
not because he’s lazy or unmotivated or oppositional, but because
that’s his best strategy for dealing with the intense selfconsciousness he feels when doing something athletic in front of his
peers.
By wondering what our kids are trying to accomplish and by
allowing them to explain a situation before we rush to judgment,
we’re able to gather actual data from their internal world, as
opposed to simply reacting based on assumptions, faulty theories,
or shark music. Plus, when we chase the why and connect ɹrst, we
let our children know that we’re on their side, that we’re interested
in their internal experience. We say to them, by the way we
respond to each situation, that when we don’t know what actually
happened, we’re going to give them the beneɹt of the doubt.
Again, that doesn’t mean turning a blind eye to misbehavior. It just
means that we’re looking to connect ɹrst, by asking questions and
by being curious about what’s behind the external behavior and
what’s happening inside our child.
Connection Principle #3: Think About the How
Listening for shark music and chasing the why are both principles
that ask us to consider our own and our child’s inner landscapes
during a discipline moment. The third connection principle focuses
on the way we actually interact with our kids. It challenges us to
consider the way we talk to our children when they’re having
trouble managing themselves or making good decisions. What we
say to our kids is of course important. But you know that just as
important, if not more important, is how we say it.
Imagine that your three-year-old isn’t getting into her car seat.
Here are a few different hows for saying the exact same what:
• With eyes wide, big gestures, and a loud, angry tone of voice:
“Get in your car seat!”
• With clenched teeth, squinted eyes, and a seething tone of
voice: “Get in your car seat.”
• With a relaxed face and a warm tone of voice: “Get in your car
seat.”
• With a wacky facial expression and a goofy voice: “Get in your
car seat.”
You get the idea. The how matters. At bedtime you might use a
threat: “Get in bed now or you won’t get any stories.” Or you could
say,
“If you get in bed now, we’ll have time to read. But if you
don’t get in bed right away, we’ll run out of time and have to skip
reading.” The message is the same, but how it’s communicated is
very diʃerent. It has an entirely diʃerent feel. Both hows model
ways of talking to others. Both set a boundary. Both deliver the
same request. But they feel completely different.
It’s the how that determines what our children feel about us and
themselves, and what they learn about treating others. Plus, the
how goes a long way toward determining their response in the
moment, and how successful we’ll be at helping produce an
eʃective outcome that makes everyone happier. Children usually
cooperate much more quickly if they feel connected to us, and
when we engage them in a pleasant and playful exchange. It’s the
how that determines that. We can be much more eʃective
disciplinarians if our how is respectful, playful, and calm.
So those are the three connection principles. By checking for shark
music, chasing the why, and thinking about the how, we set the
stage for connection. As a result, when our kids behave in ways we
don’t like, we have the opportunity to connect ɹrst, prioritizing the
relationship and improving the odds of a successful disciplinary
outcome. Now let’s look at some specific connection strategies.
The No-Drama Connection Cycle
What does connection actually look like? What can we do to help
our kids feel felt and know that we’re with them, right in the
middle of whatever they’re going through, as we engage in the
discipline process?
As always, the answer will change based on your individual child
and your personal parenting style, but most often, connection
comes down to a four-part, cyclical process. We call it the NoDrama connection cycle.
It won’t always follow the exact same order, but for the most
part, connecting with our children when they’re upset or
misbehaving involves these four strategies. The ɹrst: communicate
comfort.
Connection Strategy #1: Communicate Comfort
Remember that sometimes your kids need your help calming down
and making good choices. It’s when their emotions get the best of
them that we have the most discipline issues. And just as you’d
hold and rock or pat a baby to calm her nervous system, you want
to help your children calm down when they need it. Words are
useful, especially when you’re validating feelings. But most
nurturing takes place nonverbally. We can communicate so much
without ever talking.
The most powerful nonverbal response of all is one that you
probably do automatically: you touch your child. You put your
hand on her arm. You pull her close to you. You rub her back. You
hold her hand. A loving touch—whether subtle, like the squeeze of
a hand, or more demonstrative, like a full, warm embrace—has the
power to quickly defuse a heated situation.
The reason is that when we feel someone touch us in a way
that’s nurturing and loving, feel-good hormones (like oxytocin) are
released into our brain and body, and our levels of cortisol, a stress
hormone, decrease. In other words, giving your kids loving physical
aʃection literally and beneɹcially alters their brain chemistry. When
your child (or your partner!) is feeling upset, a loving touch can
calm things down and help you two connect, even during moments
of high stress.
Touch is only one way we communicate with our children
nonverbally. We’re actually sending messages all the time, even
when we never utter a word. Think about your typical body
posture when you discipline your kids. Do you ever ɹnd yourself
leaning over your child with an angry look on your face? Maybe
you’re saying, in a scary tone of voice,
“Knock it oʃ!” or “Stop that
this instant!” This approach is essentially the opposite of
connection, and it’s not going to be very eʃective at calming your
child. Your escalated response will intensify her emotions even
further. Even if your intimidation results in your child appearing
calm, she’ll actually be feeling anything other than calm. Her heart
will pound in response to the stress because she is afraid enough to
shut down her emotions and hide her feelings in an attempt to keep
you from becoming more angry.
Would you approach an upset animal in a similar fashion? If you
had to interact with an angry-looking dog, would you approach it
with an aggressive body posture and demand that the dog “knock it
oʃ and calm down”? That wouldn’t be very smart, nor would it be
eʃective. The reason is that it would communicate to the dog that
you’re a threat, and the dog would have no other option than to
react, either by cowering or by ɹghting. So instead, we’re taught to
approach a dog by putting out the back of our hand, crouching
down low, and speaking with a soft, reassuring voice. In doing so,
our whole body communicates a message: “I’m not a threat.” In
response, the dog can relax, calm down, feel safe, and then
approach and engage.
The same process occurs with people. When we feel threatened,
our social engagement circuitry can’t turn on. We have trouble
engaging our upstairs brain, the part that is thoughtful, makes
sound decisions, and has the capacity for empathy and regulating
our emotions and body. Instead of calming down and making good
decisions, we simply react. This reaction make sense,
evolutionarily speaking. When the brain detects threat, the
downstairs area immediately goes on alert and becomes highly
activated. Functioning in this more primitive mode allows us to
keep ourselves safe by being hypervigilant, by acting quickly
without thinking, or by going into ɹght, ɻight, freeze, or faint
mode.
It’s the same with our kids. When emotions escalate and we
respond by communicating threat—through the frustrated or angry
look on our face, our mad tone of voice, our intimidating posture
(hands on hips, ɹnger wagging, leaning forward)—their innate
biological response will be to activate their downstairs brain.
However, when their caregivers communicate “I’m not a threat,
”
then the reactive, ɹghting, act-before-thinking downstairs part of
the brain quiets, and they can move into a mode of processing that
allows them to handle themselves well.
So, how do we communicate “I’m not a threat” to our kids, even
in the midst of escalating emotions? By connecting. One of the
most eʃective and powerful ways to do this is to put your body in
a posture that’s the opposite of imposing and threatening. Lots of
people talk about getting at a child’s eye level, but one of the
quickest ways to communicate safety and the absence of threat is
to get below the child’s eye level and put your body into a very
relaxed position that communicates calm. You see other mammals
doing this to send the message “I am not a threat to you. You don’t
need to fight me.”
We recommend that you try this “below eye level” technique the
next time your child is upset or out of control emotionally. Put
your body in a chair, on a bed, or on the ɻoor so that you are
below your child’s eye level. Whether you lean back or cross your
legs or open your arms, just make sure that your body
communicates comfort and safety. Your words and your body
language combine to convey empathy and connection, telling your
child,
“I’m right here. I’ll comfort you and help you.” You’ll
comfort her nervous system and calm her down, just as you did by
holding and rocking her when she was a baby and needed you.
We’ve been thrilled by how many of the parents to whom we’ve
taught this technique report that this approach is “magic.” They
can’t believe how quickly their children calm down. What amazes
the parents just as much is that putting their bodies into this
relaxed, nonthreatening posture actually calms down the parents
themselves as well. They report that this approach works better than
anything else they’ve tried to keep themselves calm, and it leads to
the best outcomes in how well they handle the high-stress situation.
Obviously you can’t get down on the ground if you’re in the car or
walking across the street, but you can use your tone of voice and
posture, as well as your empathic words, to communicate the
absence of threat, so you can connect with your child and produce
a calm in both of you.
Nonverbal communication is so powerful. Your child’s whole day
can turn on something you’re not even cognizant of, something
that’s not even said. Something as simple as your smile can soothe
a disappointment and strengthen your bond. You know that
moment: when your child does something she’s excited about, like
kicking a soccer goal or reciting a line in a play, and she looks for
you in the crowd. Your eyes meet and you smile, and she knows
that you’re saying,
“I saw that and I share your joy.” That’s what
your nonverbal connection can do.
Or it can do just the opposite. Look at the pictures below, and
notice what message these parents are sending. Without ever
opening their mouths, each parent is saying plenty.


The fact is that we send all kinds of messages, whether we intend
to or not. And if we’re not careful, our nonverbals can undermine
the connection we’re aiming for in a high-emotion disciplinary
environment. Crossing the arms, shaking the head, rubbing the
temples, rolling the eyes, a sarcastic wink at another adult in the
room—even if our words are expressing interest in what our child
is saying, there are plenty of ways our nonverbals betray us. And if
our verbal and nonverbal messages contradict each other, our child
will believe the nonverbal. That’s why it’s so important that we
pay attention to what we’re communicating without saying
anything at all.
When we do, we’ll be more likely to communicate the messages
we want to communicate to our kids.

We’re not saying there won’t be high-emotion disciplinary
moments where you get completely exasperated with your kids. Or
that they won’t misread something you’re communicating and get
upset. Mistakes will be made on both sides of the relationship, of
course. Likewise, sometimes you may decide it’s appropriate to use
nonverbal communication to help your kids monitor themselves
and rein in their impulses when necessary. But the bottom line is
that we can be intentional about the verbal and nonverbal
messages we’re sending, especially when we’re trying to connect
with our children in a diɽcult moment. Simply nodding, and being
physically present, communicates care.
Connection Strategy #2: Validate, Validate, Validate
The key to connection when children are reactive or making bad
choices is validation. In addition to communicating comfort, we
need to let our kids know that we hear them. That we understand.
That we get it. Whether or not we like the behavior that results
from their feelings, we want them to feel acknowledged and sense
that we’re with them in the middle of all those big feelings.
Put diʃerently, we want to attune to our children’s inner
subjective experiences, focusing our attention on how they are
experiencing things from their point of view. Just as in a duet both
instruments need to be tuned to each other to make good music,
we need to tune our own emotional response to what’s going on
with our kids. We need to see their mind and recognize their
internal state, then join with them in what we see and how we
respond. In doing so, we join them in their emotional space. We
deliver the message,
“I get you. I see what you’re feeling, and I
acknowledge it. If I were in your shoes, and at your age, I might
feel the same way.” When kids receive this type of message from
their parents, they “feel felt.” They feel understood. They feel
loved. And as a huge bonus, they can then begin to calm down and
make better decisions, and hear the lessons you want to teach
them.
Practically speaking, validation means resisting the temptation to
deny or minimize what our kids are going through. When we
validate their feelings we avoid saying things like,
“Why are you
throwing a fit about not having a playdate? You were at Carrie’s all
day yesterday!” We avoid pronouncing,
“I know your brother tore
your picture, but that’s no reason to hit him! You can just make
another one.” We avoid declaring,
“Stop worrying about it.”
Think about it: how does it make you feel when you’re upset,
and maybe not handling yourself well, and someone tells you that
you’re “just tired,
” or that whatever’s bothering you “isn’t that big
a deal” and you should “just calm down”? When we tell our kids
how to feel—and how not to feel—we invalidate their experiences.
Most of us know better than to directly tell our kids they
shouldn’t be upset. But when one of your children reacts intensely
to something that doesn’t go his way, do you ever immediately
shut down that reaction? We don’t mean to, but parents can often
send the message that we think the way they feel about and
experience a situation is ridiculous or not worthy of our
acknowledgment. Or we inadvertently communicate that we don’t
want to interact with our kids or be with them when they have
negative emotions. It’s like saying,
“I will not accept that you feel
how you feel. I’m not interested in how you experience the world.”
It’s a way of making a child feel invisible, unseen, and
disconnected.
Instead, we want to communicate that we’ll always be there for
them, even at their absolute worst. We are willing to see them for
whoever they are, whatever they may feel. We want to join with
them where they are, and acknowledge what they’re going
through. To a young child we might say,
“You really wanted to go
to Mia’s house today, didn’t you? It’s so disappointing that her
mom had to cancel.” Especially with older children, we might
identify with what they’re going through, letting them know that
even though we’re saying no to their behavior, we’re saying yes to
their feelings: “That made you so mad that Keith tore your picture,
didn’t it? I hate it when my stuʃ gets messed with, too. I don’t
blame you for being furious.” Remember, the ɹrst response is to
connect. Redirection will come, and you’ll deɹnitely want to
address the behavioral response, but ɹrst we connect, which
communicates comfort and almost always involves validation.
Usually validation is pretty simple. The main thing you need to
do is simply identify the feeling at hand: “That really made you
sad, didn’t it?” or “I can see you feel left out,
” or even a more
general “You’re having a hard time.” Identifying the emotion is an
extremely powerful response when a child is upset because it oʃers
two huge beneɹts. First, helping her feel understood calms her
autonomic nervous system and helps soothe her big feelings, so she
can begin to put the brakes on her desire to react and lash out.
Second, it gives the child an emotional vocabulary and emotional
intelligence, so she herself can recognize and name what she’s
feeling, which helps her understand her emotions and begin to
regain control of herself so that redirection can occur. As we put it
in the previous chapter, connection—in this case, through
validation—helps move a child from reactivity to receptivity.
After acknowledging the feeling, the second part of validation is
identifying with that emotion. For a child or an adult, it’s
extremely powerful to hear someone say,
“I get you. I understand.
I see why you feel this way.” This kind of empathy disarms us. It
relaxes our rigidity. It soothes our chaos. Even if an emotion seems
ridiculous to you, don’t forget that it’s very real to your child, so
you don’t want to dismiss something that’s important to her.
Tina recently received an email that reminded her that it’s not
only young children who need to be validated when they’re upset.
She heard from a mother in Australia who had listened to a radio
program where Tina talked about the power of connection. Part of
the mother’s email went like this:
Right in the middle of listening I received a call from
my nineteen-year-old daughter, who was having a
meltdown. She was in pain from a physical therapy
session, her bank account was in the negative, she didn’t
understand a lot of today’s Business Law lecture, she
was stressed about her exam tomorrow, and work
wanted her to come in two hours early.
My ɹrst reaction was to say,
“First-world problems.
Suck it up, princess.” But after hearing your interview, I
realised that while indeed they were ɹrst-world
problems, they were her ɹrst-world problems. So I said
that I was sorry for her bad day, and did she need a
mummy hug?
It made so much diʃerence. I could hear her take a
breath and relax. I told her I loved her, that her dad and
I would fund her textbooks (which was why her bank
account was in the negative), and that after her exam
tomorrow I’d treat her to her favourite noodle soup at
Bamboo Basket.
She was much more relaxed after the call, thanks to
how I responded. So often we react harshly without
realising the impact it may have. Even when our kids
are mostly past the tantrum stage and we have a calm
life with them, there’s so many times throughout the
day to put these ideas into practice.
Notice this mother’s well-executed validation of her daughter’s
experience. She didn’t invalidate her daughter’s feelings by denying
them, minimizing them, or blaming her. Instead, she acknowledged
the bad day and asked whether she needed a hug. Her daughter’s
response was to take a deep breath and relax—not because her
parents were going to help her ɹnancially, but because her feelings
were acknowledged and identiɹed. Because they were validated.
Then the actual problems could be addressed.
So when your child is crying, raging, attacking a sibling,
throwing a ɹt because his stuʃed dog is too ɻoppy and won’t sit up
properly, or demonstrating in any other way that he’s incapable of
making good decisions at that moment, validate the emotions
behind the actions. Again, it might ɹrst be necessary to remove
him from the situation. Validation doesn’t mean allowing someone
to get hurt or property to be destroyed. You’re not endorsing bad
behavior when you identify with your child’s emotions. You’re
attuning to him. You’re tuning your instrument to his, so that you
two can create something beautiful together. You’re meeting him
where he is, looking for the meaning, the emotional undercurrent,
behind his actions. You acknowledge and identify what he’s feeling,
and in doing so, you validate his experience.
Connection Strategy #3: Stop Talking and Listen
If you’re like most of us, you talk way too much when you
discipline. This response is actually funny if you think about it. Our
child has gotten upset and made a bad decision, so we think,
“I
know. I’ll lecture him. He’ll calm down and make a better choice
next time if I make him sit still and listen to me drone on and on
about what he’s done wrong.” Want to turn your kids oʃ,
especially as they get older? Explain something, then keep making
the same point over and over.
What’s more, talking and talking to an emotionally activated
child is not the least bit eʃective. When her emotions are
exploding all over the place, one of the least eʃective things we
can do is to talk at her, trying to get her to understand the logic of
our position. It’s just not helpful to say,
“He didn’t mean to hit you
when he threw the ball; it was just an accident, so you don’t have
to get mad.” It doesn’t do any good to explain,
“She can’t invite
everyone in your whole school to her party.”
The problem with this logical appeal is that it assumes the child
is capable of hearing and responding to reason at this moment. But
remember, a child’s brain is changing, developing. When she’s hurt,
angry, or disappointed, the logical part of her upstairs brain isn’t
fully functioning. That means a linguistic appeal to reason isn’t
usually going to be your best bet for helping her gain control over
her emotions and calm herself.
In fact, talking often compounds the problem. We know, because
we hear it from the kids we see in our oɽces. Sometimes they
want to scream at their parents,
“Please stop talking!” Especially
when they’re in trouble and already understand what they’ve done
wrong. An upset child is already on sensory overload. And what
does talking to him do? It further ɻoods his senses, leaving him
even more dysregulated, feeling even more overwhelmed, and
much less able to learn or even hear you.
So we recommend that parents follow the kids’ advice and stop
talking so much. Communicate comfort and validate your child’s
feelings—“It really hurt that you didn’t get invited, didn’t it? I’d
feel left out, too”—then close your mouth and listen. Really listen
to what she’s saying. Don’t interpret what you hear too literally. If
she says she’s never going to get invited to another party, this isn’t
an invitation for you to disagree, or to challenge this absolute
statement. Your job is to hear the feelings within the words.
Recognize that she’s saying,
“I’ve really been thrown for a loop by
this. I didn’t get invited, and now I’m afraid about what this says
about my social standing with all of my friends.”
Clue in and chase the why as to what’s really going on inside
your child. Focus on her emotions, letting go of the shark music
that prevents you from being fully present with her in the moment.
No matter how strong your desire, avoid the temptation to argue
with your child, lecture her, defend yourself, or tell her to stop
feeling that way. Now’s not the time to teach or explain. Now is
the time to listen, just sitting with your child and giving her time to
express herself.
Connection Strategy #4: Reflect What You Hear
With the ɹrst three strategies of the No-Drama connection cycle,
we communicate comfort, we validate feelings, and we listen. The
fourth step is to reɻect back to our children what they’ve said,
letting them know we’ve heard them. Reɻecting their feelings
returns us to the ɹrst strategy, since we’re again communicating
comfort, which can lead us through the cycle once more.
Reɻecting what we hear is similar to the second step, but it
diʃers from validation in that now we focus speciɹcally on what
our children have actually told us. The validation stage is all about
recognizing emotions and empathizing with our kids. We say
something like,
“I can tell how mad you are.” But when we reɻect
our children’s feelings, we essentially communicate back to them
what they have told us. Handled sensitively, this allows a child to
feel heard and understood. As we said, it’s extraordinarily calming,
even healing, to feel understood. When you let your child know
that you really grasp what he’s telling you—by telling her,
“I hear
what you’re saying; you really hated it when I told you we had to
leave the party,
” or “No wonder that made you mad; I’d feel angry,
too”—you take a huge step toward defusing the high emotions at
play.
Be careful, though, with how you reflect feelings. You don’t want
to take one of your child’s short-term, temporary emotions and
turn it into something bigger and more permanent than it really is.
Let’s say, for example, your six-year-old becomes so upset about
her big brother’s constant teasing that she begins yelling, over and
over again,
“You’re so stupid and I hate you!” Right there in your
backyard, with the neighbors hearing it all (thank goodness Mr.
Patel is mowing his lawn!), she repeats the refrain nonstop,
seemingly dozens of times, until she ɹnally falls into your arms,
crying uncontrollably.
So you initiate the connection cycle. You communicate comfort,
conveying your compassion by getting below her eye level, holding
her, rubbing her back, and making empathic facial expressions. You
validate her experience: “I know, honey, I know. You’re really
upset.” You listen to her feelings, then you reɻect back to her what
you’re hearing: “You’re just so angry, aren’t you?” Her response
might be a return to yelling: “Yes, and I hate Jimmy!” (with her
brother’s name drawn out into another scream).
Now comes the tricky part. You want to reɻect for her what
she’s feeling, but you don’t want to reinforce this narrative in her
mind that she actually hates her brother. A situation like this calls
for some careful tiptoeing, so that you can be honest with your
daughter and help her better understand her feelings but keep her
from solidifying her momentary emotions into longer-lasting
perceptions. So you might say something like,
“I don’t blame you
for being so mad. I hate it when people tease me like that, too. I
know you love Jimmy, and that you two were having so much fun
together just a few minutes ago, when you were playing with the
wagon. But you’re pretty mad at him right now, aren’t you?” The
goal with this type of reɻecting is to make sure your child
comprehends that you understand her experience, and in doing so
to soothe her big emotions and help calm her inner chaos, so that
she can move back into the center of her river of well-being. But
you don’t want to allow a feeling that’s simply a momentary state—
her anger with her brother—to be perceived in her mind as a
permanent trait that’s an inherent part of their relationship. That’s
why you give her perspective and remind her of the fun she and
her brother were having with the wagon.
One other advantage that comes with reɻecting our children’s
feelings is that it communicates that they have not only our love,
but our attention. Parents sometimes assume that it’s bad when a
child seeks our attention. They’ll say,
“He’s just trying to get my
attention.” The problem with this perspective is that it presumes
it’s somehow not okay for a child to want his parents to notice him
and pay attention to what he’s doing. In reality, though, attentionseeking behavior is not only completely developmentally appropriate, it’s
actually relational. Attention is a need of all children everywhere. In
fact, brain imaging studies show that the experience of physical
pain and the experience of relational pain, like rejection, look very
similar in terms of location of brain activity. So when we give our
kids attention and focus on what they’re doing and feeling, we
meet an important relational and emotional need, and they deeply
feel connected and comforted. Remember, there are plenty of ways
to spoil children—by giving them too many things, by rescuing
them from every challenge, by never allowing them to deal with
defeat and disappointment—but we can never spoil them by giving
them too much of our love and attention.
That’s what the connection cycle does: it lets us communicate to
our kids that we love them, that we see them, and that we are with
them no matter how they behave. When we turn down the shark
music, chase the why, and think about the how, we can
communicate comfort, validate, listen to and reɻect feelings, and
support our kids in ways that create the kind of connection that
clearly communicates our love and prepares them for redirection.

CHAPTER 5
1-2-3 Discipline: Redirecting for Today, and for
Tomorrow
oger was working in his garage when his six-year-old, Katie,
stormed outside, angrily calling out,
“Dad! Can you do
something about Allie?” Roger soon learned that Katie was upset
because her friend Gina, who had come over for a playdate, had
become completely enamored with Katie’s nine-year-old sister,
Allie. For her part, Allie was apparently happy to monopolize the
playdate, leaving her younger sister feeling left out.
In addressing the situation with his older daughter, Roger saw
various alternatives. One would be simply to tell Allie she needed
to give Katie and Gina some time by themselves, since that was the
plan for the playdate, after all. There would be nothing wrong with
this approach, but by making the call and imposing his own agenda
on the situation, Roger would bypass the important process that
would allow Allie to use her upstairs brain.
So instead, he went into the house, called his older daughter
aside, and simply initiated a brief conversation. They sat on the
couch, and he put his arm around her. Considering Allie’s
personality and temperament, he decided to begin with a simple
question:
ROGER: Gina’s having fun playing with you, and you’re really
good with younger kids. But I’m wondering if you noticed
that Katie’s not too happy about Gina giving you all of her
attention.
ALLIE: [Defensively, sitting up and turning toward her father]
Dad, I’m not even doing anything mean. We’re just listening
to music.
ROGER: I didn’t say you’re doing anything wrong. I’m asking
whether you’ve noticed how Katie is feeling right now.
ALLIE: Yeah, but that’s not my fault!
ROGER: Sweetheart, I totally agree that it’s not your fault. Listen
to my question: do you see that Katie isn’t happy? I’m asking
whether you’ve noticed.
ALLIE: I guess.
In that one admission, we see evidence that Allie’s upstairs brain
had become engaged in the conversation, if only a little. She was
actually beginning to listen and think about what her father was
saying. At this point Roger could target which part of the upstairs
brain he wanted to appeal to and exercise. Not by telling Allie what
she should think or feel, but by asking her to consider the situation
for herself, and to pay attention to what someone else was
experiencing.
ROGER: Why do you think she might be upset?
ALLIE: I guess because she wants Gina all to herself. But that girl
came into my room! I didn’t even ask her to.
ROGER: I know. And you may be right that Katie wants Gina all
to herself. But do you think that’s it, exactly? If she were
standing here and told us how she felt, what would she say?
ALLIE: That it’s her playdate, not mine.
ROGER: That’s probably pretty close. Would she have a point?
ALLIE: I just don’t see why we can’t all listen to music together.
Seriously, Dad.
ROGER: I get it. I might even agree with you. But what would
Katie say to that?
ALLIE: That when we’re all together Gina just wants to play with
me?
And with that question the empathy broke through. It was only
an emerging awareness; we can’t expect a huge Lifetime movie
moment where a nine-year-old girl is moved to tears out of her
compassion for her little sister’s emotional pain. But it was a start.
Allie was, at the very least, consciously beginning to consider the
feelings of her sister (which, if you have young children, you know
is no small parental victory). From there, Roger could direct the
conversation so that Allie would think more explicitly about Katie’s
feelings. Then he could ask for Allie’s help in coming up with a
plan for handling the situation—“Maybe we listen to one more
song, then I get ready for my slumber party?”—and in so doing he
would further engage her upstairs brain by having her plan and
problem-solve.
Initiating a redirection conversation like this won’t always be
successful. There will be times when a child will be unwilling (or
even unable) to see a diʃerent perspective, to listen and consider
the feelings of others. Roger might end up simply telling Allie she
needs to ɹnd something else to do, just as Liz had to make the call
when her daughter wouldn’t give in about who was going to drive
her to school. Or maybe he could play a game with all three girls,
making sure everyone feels included.

But notice that when he needed to redirect, Roger didn’t
immediately impose his own sense of justice on the situation. By
facilitating empathy and problem solving, he gave his daughter a
chance to exercise her upstairs brain. The more we give kids the
opportunity to consider not only their own desires, but also the
desires of others, and practice making good choices that positively
impact the people around them, the better they’ll be at doing so.
Does a conversation like this one between Roger and Allie take
longer than simply separating the girls? Of course. Is it harder to
do? Yes, probably. But is collaborative and respectful redirection
worth the eʃort and extra time? No question about it. And as it
becomes your default, it actually makes things easier on you and
your entire family, since there will be fewer battles, and you’ll be
building your child’s brain in such a way that less and less often
will you even have to address misbehavior.
1-2-3 Discipline
In this chapter we want to take a closer look at the concept of
redirection, which is actually what most people mean when they
think of discipline. Redirection is how we respond when our kids
do something we don’t like, such as throwing something in anger,
or when they’re not doing something we want them to do, like
brush their teeth and get ready for bed. After we’ve connected,
how do we address uncooperative or reactive kids, redirecting
them toward using their upstairs brain so they can make more
appropriate decisions that become second nature over time?
As we’ve said, No-Drama Discipline is about connecting and
being emotionally responsive to our children, while aiming for the
short-term goal of gaining cooperation now, as well as the longterm goal of building our child’s brain. A simple way to think about
redirection is to take a 1-2-3 approach that focuses on one
deɹnition, two principles, and three desired outcomes. You don’t
need to memorize every detail of the approach (especially since
we’ve given you a handy Refrigerator Sheet at the back of the
book). Just use it as an organizing framework to help you focus on
what’s important when it comes time to redirect your kids.
One Definition
The place to begin when thinking about redirecting our kids toward
better behavior is with the deɹnition of discipline. When our
children make unwise decisions or can’t manage their emotions, we
need to remember that discipline is about teaching. If we forget this
simple truth, we’ll go oʃ course. If discipline becomes about
punishment, for example, we can miss the opportunity to teach. By
focusing on the consequences of misbehavior, we limit the
opportunity for children to experience the physiological and
emotional workings of their inner compass.
One mom told us the story of ɹnding a small box of crayons
when she and her six-year-old were cleaning her daughter’s room.
They had been shopping for school supplies a few days before, and
her daughter had fallen in love with these particular crayons. The
mother had not bought the crayons, but her daughter had slipped
them into her pocket anyway.
The mother said that when she found the crayons she decided to
ask her daughter about them directly. When the little girl saw the
crayons in her mom’s cupped hand and the mother’s look of
confusion, her eyes got wide and full of fear and guilt. In a moment
like this, the parental response is going to largely determine what a
child takes away from the experience. As we explained in Chapter
1, if the parent’s focus is on consequences or punishment, and she
immediately yells, spanks, sends the child to her room, or takes
away an upcoming opportunity she’s excited about, then the child’s
focus will immediately shift. Instead of having her attention on
that “uh-oh” feeling bubbling up inside of her, or instead of
thinking about the decision she made when she took the crayons
from the store, all of her attention will focus on how mean or scary
her parent is for punishing her in this way. She may even feel like
a victim, who is somehow retroactively justiɹed in swiping the
crayons.
Instead, this mom oʃered a disciplinary approach focused on
teaching rather than immediate consequences. She gave her
daughter time to sit with and be aware of that uncomfortable,
valuable, natural guilt she was feeling as a result of having taken
something that wasn’t hers. Yes, guilt can even be healthy. It is
evidence of a healthy conscience! And it can shape future behavior.
When the mother talked to her daughter, she knelt down (getting
below eye level, as we discussed a few pages ago), and an
endearing conversation ensued during which the six-year-old at
ɹrst denied taking the crayons, then said she didn’t remember, and
then, with the mom patiently waiting, eventually explained that
her mother had nothing to worry about, because “I waited till the
saleslady with the big hair wasn’t looking” to put the crayons in the
pocket of her shorts. At this point the mother asked lots of
questions that encouraged her daughter to think through concepts
she hadn’t yet considered: “Do you know what taking something
that doesn’t belong to you is called?” “Is stealing against the law?”
“Did you know that the woman with the big hair in the store spent
her money to buy those crayons so she could put them in her
store?”
In response, the daughter dropped her head further; her bottom
lip started to come forward, and big tears began to fall. She
obviously felt bad about what she had done. As she quietly cried,
the mom pulled her close, not distracting her or stopping the
process of what was already happening naturally, but joining with
her as she said,
“You’re feeling bad about it.” The daughter nodded,
and the tears continued. The mom could comfort and be with her
daughter in this beautiful moment where the discipline process
continued naturally without the mom even doing or saying
anything. The mother held her and allowed her to cry and to feel,
and after a couple of minutes she helped wipe away the tears and
encouraged her daughter to take a deep breath. Then they
continued their conversation brieɻy, talking about honesty, about
respecting others’ property, and about doing the right thing, even
when it’s hard.
By initiating this collaborative, reɻective dialogue and allowing
discipline to naturally arise simply by orienting her daughter’s
attention to the internal guilt she was already feeling, rather than
just laying out instant consequences, the mother allowed her
daughter to give her upstairs brain some exercise by considering
her actions and how they aʃected others, and by learning some
basic lessons about ethics and morality. Then they made plans for
how best to return the crayons to “the saleslady with the big hair.”
No-Drama Discipline is all about teaching, and that’s what this
mother focused on. She allowed her daughter to thoughtfully
experience the feelings and thoughts associated with her decision to
take the crayons. By allowing the child’s own internal experience
to remain at the forefront of her mind—rather than shifting the
emotions into anger over a punishment handed out—she allowed
her daughter’s brain not only to become aware of that inner
discomfort, but also to link it to the experience of making poor
choices, in this case, stealing. Again, being punitive or doling out
consequences, especially when we’re angry and reactive, can be
counterproductive because it distracts our children from the
physiological and emotional messages of their own conscience,
which is a powerful force in developing self-discipline.
Remember, neurons that wire together ɹre together. And we
want our kids to experience the natural linkage between making a
bad decision in one moment, then feeling guilty and ill at ease the
next. Because the brain is driven to avoid experiences that produce
negative sensations, the aversive feelings that naturally arise
within a child when she does something that violates her inner
conscience can be very ɻeeting in her conscious mind. But when
we help her become aware of these sensations and emotions, they
can become the important basis for ethics and self-control. This selfregulation or executive function that develops can then engage even
when her parent isn’t there, or when no one is looking. This is how she
internalizes the lesson on a synaptic level. Our own nervous
systems can become our very best guides!
Diʃerent disciplinary situations will obviously call for diʃerent
parental responses. This mother responded based on what lesson
her daughter needed in that particular moment. In other
circumstances she might respond diʃerently. The point is simply
that once we’ve connected with our kids in a disciplinary moment
and it’s time to redirect, we’ve got to keep in mind the importance
of awareness and helping the brain learn. Reɻection with a child
helps him become aware of what’s happening internally, and that
optimizes learning. When we keep in mind the deɹnition of
discipline, we realize that sharing awareness helps learning occur.
Discipline is all about teaching to optimize learning.
Two Principles
We also want to follow two main principles when redirecting our
children, allowing those two principles to guide whatever we do.
These principles, along with the speciɹc strategies that follow from
them, encourage cooperation from kids and make life easier for
adults and kids alike.
Principle #1: Wait Until Your Child Is Ready
Remember what we said in Chapter 3: connection moves a child
from reactivity to receptivity. So once you’ve connected and
allowed your child to come to a place where he’s ready to listen
and use his upstairs brain, then it’s time to redirect. Not before.
One of the most self-defeating parenting recommendations we hear
from time to time goes something like this: “When a child
misbehaves, it’s important that you address the behavior right
away. Otherwise, they won’t understand why they are being
disciplined.”
We actually don’t think this is bad advice if you are running a
behavioral conditioning lab with animals. For mice, or even dogs,
it’s good advice. For human beings, not so much. The fact is that
there are times when it does make sense to address misbehavior
right away. However, it’s frequently the case that the absolute
worst time to address a misbehavior is immediately after it’s
occurred.
The reason is simple. Misbehavior often happens because a child
isn’t able to regulate his big feelings. And when his emotions are
dysregulated, his upstairs brain has gone oʃ-line. It’s temporarily
out of order, meaning he’s not able to accomplish the tasks his
upstairs brain is responsible for: making good decisions, thinking
about others, considering consequences, balancing his emotions and
body, and being a receptive learner. So yes, we do recommend that
you address a behavioral issue fairly soon when possible, but only
when your child is in a calm and receptive state of mind—even if
you need to wait. Even children as young as three can remember
what happened in recent history, including the day before. You can
begin that conversation by saying,
“I’d like to talk about what
happened yesterday at bedtime. That didn’t go so well, did it?”
Waiting for the right time is essential when it comes to teaching
effectively.
So let’s go back to the suggestion we made in Chapter 4. Once
you’ve connected, and you’re wondering whether it’s time to move
into the redirection phase, ask yourself one simple question: “Is my
child ready? Ready to hear, ready to learn, ready to understand?”
If the answer is no, then there’s no reason to try to redirect in that
moment. Most likely, more connection is called for. Or, especially
for older kids, you may just need to give them some time and
space before they’ll be ready to hear you.
When we talk to educators, we often explain that there’s an
optimal window, or sweet spot, for teaching. If students’ nervous
systems are what we call underaroused—because they are sleepy,
bored, or checked out for some other reason—then they are in an
unreceptive state, meaning the students won’t be able to learn
eʃectively. And the opposite is just as bad. If students’ nervous
systems are overaroused—meaning they feel anxious or stressedout, or their bodies are hyperactive with lots of motor activity and
movement—that also produces an unreceptive state when it’s
diɽcult for them to learn. Instead, we need to create an
environment that helps them move into a state of mind that’s calm,
alert, and receptive. That’s the sweet spot where learning really
takes place. That’s the moment they’re ready to learn.
It’s the same with our kids. When their nervous systems are
under- or overaroused, they won’t be nearly as receptive to what
we want to teach them. So when we discipline, we want to wait
until they are calm, alert, and receptive. Ask yourself: “Is my child
ready?” Even after you’ve connected and soothed your child’s
negative state, it still might be best to wait for a time later in the
day or even the next day to ɹnd a better moment for the explicit
teaching and redirection. You can even say,
“I’d like to wait until
we’re really able to talk and listen to each other. We’ll come back
and talk about it in a while.”
As a side note, just as it’s important to ask,
“Is my child ready?”
it’s also important to ask yourself,
“Am I ready?” If you are in a
reactive state of mind, it’s best to wait to have the conversation.
You can’t be an eʃective teacher if you’re not in a calm and
collected state. If you’re too upset to remain in control, you’re
likely to approach the whole interaction in a way that’s
counterproductive to your goals of teaching and building
connection. In that case, it’s often better to say something like,
“I’m too angry to have a helpful conversation right now, so I’m
going to take some time to calm down, and then we’ll talk in a
bit.” Then, once you are both ready, discipline will be more
effective and feel better to both of you.
Principle #2: Be Consistent, but Not Rigid
There’s no question about it: consistency is crucial when it comes
to raising and disciplining our children. Many parents we see in our
oɽces realize that they need to work on being more consistent
with their kids—whether it’s with bedtimes, limiting junk food or
media, or just in general. But there are other parents who place
such a high priority on consistency that it becomes a rigidity that’s
not good for their kids, themselves, or the parent-child
relationship.
Let’s get clear on the diʃerence between the two terms.
Consistency means working from a reliable and coherent philosophy
so that our kids know what we expect of them and what they
should expect from us. Rigidity, on the other hand, means
maintaining an unswerving devotion to rules we’ve set up,
sometimes without having even thought them through, or without
changing them as our kids develop. As parents, we want to be
consistent, but not rigid.
Kids obviously need consistency. They need to know what our
expectations are, and how we will respond if they break (or even
bend) agreed-upon rules. Your reliability teaches them about what
to expect in their world. More than that, it helps them feel safe;
they know they can count on you to be constant and steady, even
when their internal or external world is chaotic. This kind of
predictable, sensitive, attuned care is actually what builds secure
attachment. It lets us provide our kids with what’s called “safe
containment,
” since they have a secure base and clear boundaries
to help guide them when their emotions are exploding. Limits you
set are like the guardrails on the Golden Gate Bridge. For a child,
living without clear boundaries is as anxiety-provoking as driving
over that bridge without guardrails to stop you from plummeting
into San Francisco Bay.
But rigidity is not about safety or reliability; it’s about
stubbornness. It keeps parents from compromising when necessary,
or looking at context and the intention behind a behavior, or
recognizing the moments when it’s reasonable to make an
exception.
One of the main reasons parents become rigid with their children
is because they are practicing a form of fear-based parenting. They
worry that if they ever give in and allow a soft drink at one meal,
they’ll create a slippery slope and their kids will be drinking
Mountain Dew for breakfast, lunch, and dinner for the rest of their
lives. So they stick to their guns and deny the soft drink.
Or their six-year-old has a nightmare and wants to climb into bed
with them because he’s scared, but they worry that they’ll be
setting a dangerous precedent. They say,
“We don’t want him to
develop bad sleep habits. If we don’t nip it in the bud right now,
he’ll be a bad sleeper his whole childhood.” So they stick to their
guns and dutifully send him back to his bed.
We understand the fear. We’ve felt it ourselves in regard to our
own kids. And we agree that parents should deɹnitely remain
aware of whatever patterns they are setting up for their children.
That’s why consistency is so important.
But when fear-based parenting leads us to believe that we can
never make an exception about a treat—or that we can’t comfort or
nurture our frightened child in the middle of the night without
damning him to a life of sleeplessness—then we’ve moved into
rigidity. That’s parenting based on fear, not on what our child
needs in that particular moment. That’s parenting with a goal of
reducing our own anxiety and fears, rather than what will best teach
our child’s emerging mind and mold the developing brain.
So how do we maintain consistency without crossing over to
fear-based rigidity? Well, let’s start by acknowledging that there
are some non-negotiables. For instance, under no circumstances can
you let your toddler run through a busy parking lot, or your schoolage child swim without supervision, or your teenager get into a car
with a driver who’s been drinking. Physical safety is nonnegotiable.
However, that doesn’t mean you can’t ever make exceptions, or
even turn a blind eye from time to time when your child
misbehaves. For instance, if you have a rule about no technology at
the dinner table, but your four-year-old has just received a new
electronic puzzle game that he’ll play with quietly while you have
dinner with another couple, that might be a good time to make an
exception to your rule. Or if your daughter has promised that she’ll
ɹnish her homework before dinner but her grandparents show up
to take her on an outing, you might negotiate a new deal with her.

The goal, in other words, is to maintain a consistent but ɻexible
approach with your kids, so that they know what to expect from
you, but they also know that at times you will thoughtfully
consider all the factors involved. It goes back to what we talked
about in the previous chapter: response ɻexibility. We want to
intentionally respond to a situation in a way that considers what
works best for our child and for our family, even if that means
making an exception to our normal rules and expectations.
The question when it comes to consistent versus rigid discipline
is what we’re hoping to accomplish. Again, what do we want to
teach? Under normal circumstances we want to consistently
maintain our rules and expectations. But we want to avoid being
rigid, ignoring context and thus missing out on the chance to teach
the lessons we want to teach. Sometimes when we discipline, we
need to look for other ways to accomplish our goals, so we can
more effectively teach what we want our kids to learn.
At times, for example, you might try a “do-over.” Instead of
immediately oʃering a punishment for speaking disrespectfully,
you can say something like,
“I bet if you tried again, you could
come up with a more respectful way to say that.” Do-overs allow a
child a second chance to handle a situation well. It gives them
practice doing the right thing. You’re still consistently maintaining
your expectations, but you’re doing so in a way that’s often much
more beneficial than a rigidly imposed, unrelated consequence.
After all, skill development is a huge part of what discipline is all
about. And that requires repeated guidance and coaching. If you
were coaching your child’s soccer team and she was having trouble
kicking the ball straight, you wouldn’t give her consequences for
every time she shanked it. Instead, you’d give her more practice, so
that she gets better and better at kicking it where she wants it to
go. You’d want her to have a clear, familiar feeling of what it’s like
to hit the ball square and watch it sail into the goal. In the same
way, when our kids behave in ways that don’t meet the
expectations we’ve set up, sometimes the best thing we can do is to
have them practice behaving in ways that do meet our
expectations.
Another way to encourage skill building is to have your child
come up with a creative response. As much as we wish it did,
saying “I’m sorry” doesn’t actually ɹx the broken fairy wand that
was thrown in anger. An apology note and using allowance money
to buy a new wand might teach more and help develop skills
related to decision making and empathy.
The point is that in your eʃorts to build skills, you can still be
consistent while remaining ɻexible and open to other alternatives.
As kids learn about right and wrong, they also need to learn that
life is not just about external reward and punishment. Flexibility,
problem solving, considering context, and ɹxing our mistakes are
also important. Most important is for children to understand the
lesson at hand with as much personal insight as they are
developmentally capable of, and to empathize with anybody
they’ve hurt, then ɹgure out how to respond to the situation and
prevent it in the future.
In other words, there’s a lot about morality that we want to teach our
kids in addition to knowing right from wrong. We don’t want to be
their traɽc cop, following them around telling them when to stop
and when to go, and giving them tickets when they break the law.
Wouldn’t it be much better to teach them how to drive responsibly,
and give them the skills, tools, and practice to make good decisions
on their own? To do this successfully, sometimes we need to be
open to seeing the gray areas, not just the black and white. We
need to make decisions based not on an arbitrary rule we’ve
previously set down, but on what’s best for our kids and our family
right now, in this particular situation. Consistent, yes, but not rigid.
Three Mindsight Outcomes
So 1-2-3 discipline focuses on one deɹnition (teaching) and two
principles (wait until your child is ready, and be consistent but not
rigid). Now let’s look at the three outcomes we’re looking to
achieve when we redirect.
If you’ve read The Whole-Brain Child, you’re already familiar
with the term “mindsight,
” which Dan coined and discusses at
length in his books Mindsight and Brainstorm. Explained most
simply, mindsight is the ability to see our own mind, as well as the
mind of another. It allows us to develop meaningful relationships
while also maintaining a healthy and independent sense of self.
When we ask our children to consider their own feelings (using
personal insight) while also imagining how someone else might
experience a particular situation (using empathy), we are helping
them develop mindsight.
Mindsight also involves the process of integration, which we
discussed earlier. You’ll remember that integration occurs when
separate things become linked—like the right and left sides of the
brain, or two people in a relationship. When integration does not
occur, chaos or rigidity results. So when a relationship experiences
an inevitable rupture in how we honor each other’s diʃerences, or
when we don’t link compassionately to each other, that’s a break in
integration. One example of creating integration is when we repair
such a rupture. If you ɹnd that chaos or rigidity is popping up in
your connection with your kids, repair is in order. We can take
steps to repair the situation and make things right when we’ve
made a bad decision or hurt someone with our words or actions.
Let’s discuss each of these outcomes (insight, empathy, and
integration/repair) individually.
Outcome #1: Insight
One of the best outcomes of redirection as part of a No-Drama
Discipline strategy is that it helps develop personal insight in our
children. The reason is that instead of simply commanding and
demanding that our kids meet our expectations, we ask them to
notice and reɻect on their own feelings and their responses to
diɽcult situations. This can be diɽcult, as you know, since a
child’s upstairs brain is not only the last to develop, but it is often
oʃ-line in disciplinary moments. But with practice and insightbuilding conversations—like the ones we’ve been discussing and
will explain at greater length in the next chapter—children can
become more aware and understand themselves more fully. They
can develop personal mindsight that allows them to better
understand what they’re feeling, and have more control over how
they respond in difficult situations.
For young children we might facilitate this process simply by
naming the emotions we observe: “When she took away the doll, it
looked like you felt really mad. Is that right?” For older kids, openended questions are better, even if we have to “lead the witness”
toward self-understanding: “I was watching you just before you
blew up at your brother, and it looked like you were getting more
and more annoyed that he was badgering you. Is that what you
were feeling?” The hope is that his response is something like,
“Yeah! And it makes me so mad when he …” Every time a child
gets speciɹc and discusses his own emotional experience, he gains
more insight into himself and deepens his own self-understanding.
That’s a reɻective conversation that cultivates mindsight. And such
a focus on his insight can help him move toward the second desired
outcome of redirection.
Outcome #2: Empathy
Along with developing insight into themselves, we want our kids to
develop the other aspect of mindsight, empathy. The science of
neuroplasticity teaches us that repeated practice of this reɻection,
as in our reɻective dialogues with others, activates our mindsight
circuitry. And with repeated focus of attention on our inner mental
life, it also changes the wiring in the brain and builds and
strengthens the empathic, other-centered part of the upstairs brain
—what scientists call the social engagement circuitry of the
prefrontal cortex. This is the part of the brain that makes mindsight
maps not only of ourselves for insight and of others for empathy,
but also of “we” for morality and mutual understanding. That’s
what mindsight circuits create. So we want to give kids lots of
practice reɻecting on how their actions impact others, seeing things
from another’s point of view, and developing awareness of others’
feelings.
Simply asking questions and helping our children make
observations like these will be much more eʃective than preaching
sermons, delivering lectures, or giving consequences. The human
brain is capable of extending itself in a way that allows us to
comprehend the experiences of the people around us and even
sense our connections as part of a “we” that develops with them.
That’s how we experience not only empathy, but the important
sense of our interconnectedness, the integrated state that is the
basis of moral imagination, thinking, and action.
So the more we give our kids practice at considering how
someone else feels or experiences a situation, the more empathic
and caring they will become. And as these circuits of insight and
empathy develop, they naturally set the foundation for morality,
our inner sense of being not only diʃerentiated, but linked into a
larger whole. That’s integration.
Outcome #3: Integration and the Repair of Ruptures
After helping our kids to consider their own feelings and then
reɻect on how their actions impacted others, we want to ask them
what they can do to create integration as they repair the situation
and make things right. Which part of the brain do we appeal to
now? You guessed it: the upstairs brain, with its responsibility for
empathy, morality, considering the consequences of our decisions,
and controlling emotions.
We appeal to the upstairs brain by asking questions, in this case
about repairing a situation. “What can you do to make it right?
What positive step can you take to help ɹx this? What do you think
needs to happen now?” Repair builds on insight and empathy to
then move to the mindsight map of “we” as a connection is
reestablished with the other person. Once we’ve led our children
toward empathy and insight, we want to aim for the outcome of
taking action to address not only the situation their behavior has
impacted, but also the other person and, ultimately, the
relationship itself.
Taking action after hurting someone or making a bad decision
isn’t easy for any of us, including our kids. Especially when
children are little, or if they have a particularly shy temperament,
parents may need to support them and help them with their
apology. Sometimes it’s ɹne for the parent to actually deliver the
apology for the child. You two can agree on the message
beforehand. After all, not much good comes from forcing a child to
oʃer an inauthentic apology when he’s not yet ready, or forcing
him to apologize when doing so is going to ɻood his nervous
system with anxiety. It comes back to asking whether your child is
ready. Sometimes we have to wait for a child to be in the right
frame of mind.
It’s never easy to go back and try to make up for a mistake. But
No-Drama Discipline allows us to help kids learn to do so. It aims
at achieving these three outcomes: focusing on giving our children
practice at better understanding themselves with insight, seeing
things from the perspective of others with empathy, then taking
steps to improve a particular situation where they’ve done
something wrong. When children deepen their ability to know
themselves, consider the feelings of others, and take action toward
repairing a situation, they build and strengthen connections within
the frontal lobe, which allows them to better know themselves and
get along with others as they move into adolescence and
adulthood. Basically, you are teaching your child’s brain how to
make mindsight maps of “me,
” “you,
” and “we.”
1-2-3 Discipline in Action
Life gives us opportunity after opportunity to build the brain.
That’s what we saw when Roger talked to his daughter about
monopolizing her sister’s playdate. He could’ve easily called out to
his daughter something like,
“Allie, why don’t you give Katie and
Gina some time to themselves?” In doing so, though, he would
have missed an opportunity to teach Allie and help build her brain.
His response, instead, oʃered a 1-2-3 approach. By initiating a
conversation with his daughter (“Do you see that Katie isn’t
happy?”) rather than laying down the law, he focused on the one
deɹnition of discipline: teaching. He also worked from the two key
principles. First, he made sure his daughter was ready by making
her feel listened to without judgment (“I totally agree that it’s not
your fault”). And second, he avoided being overly rigid and even
asked Allie for help in coming up with a good response to the
situation. And he achieved the three outcomes, helping his
daughter think about her own actions (“Why do you think she
might be upset?”), her sister’s feelings (“If she were standing here
and told us how she felt, what would she say?”), and what
response she could take to best respond as an integrative repair to
the situation (“Let’s come up with a plan”).
The approach works with older children as well. Let’s look at an
example of how one couple applied it with their middle schooler.
At every major gift-giving occasion over the past year, Nila had
consistently written the phrase “cell phone” at the top of her wish
list. She repeatedly told her parents, Steve and Bela, that “all” the
other kids had phones. Her mom and dad held out longer than
many of their friends, but when she turned twelve, they relented.
After all, Nila was reasonably responsible, she was spending more
time independently from her parents, and a phone would make
things more convenient for everyone. They took all the measures
they knew were important—disabling the phone’s Internet
capabilities, downloading apps that would ɹlter out dangerous
content, talking with her about issues like privacy and security—
then moved on to this next phase in their parenting lives.
During the first few months, Nila made her parents’ decision look
good. She kept track of the phone and used it appropriately, and
they learned that they hadn’t overestimated the convenience
factor.
But one night Bela heard Nila coughing an hour after lights-out,
so she opened the door to her room to check on her. The blue glow
hovering over Nila’s bed instantly disappeared, but it was
obviously too late. She was busted.
Bela ɻipped on the overhead light, and before she could say
anything, Nila hurried to explain: “Mom, I was worried about the
test and couldn’t sleep, so I was just trying to get my mind on
something else.”
Bela knew better than to overreact, especially when her primary
goal in that moment was to get her daughter back to sleep, so she
ɹrst connected: “I can understand needing to get your mind on
something else. I hate it when I can’t sleep.” Then she simply said,
“But let’s talk about it tomorrow. Hand me the phone, and I want
you to go right to sleep.”
When Bela told Steve, she learned that he had had a similar
interaction with Nila just the previous week when Bela was gone,
and he’d forgotten to mention it. So now they had two cases of
their daughter blatantly disregarding rules about cell phone usage
and sleep.
Taking a 1-2-3 approach, Steve and Bela focused on the one
deɹnition of discipline. What lesson did they want to teach here?
They wanted to emphasize the importance of honesty,
responsibility, trust, and following the rules the family members
have all agreed to. As they considered how to respond to Nila’s
infractions, they kept this deɹnition front and center in their
minds.
Then they focused on the two principles. Bela demonstrated the
ɹrst one—making sure her daughter was ready—when she simply
took Nila’s phone and asked her to go to sleep. Late at night, when
everyone is tired and a child is up later than she should be, is
rarely the best time to teach a lesson. Lecturing Nila right then
would have likely turned into all kinds of drama, leaving both
mother and daughter frustrated and angry. Not exactly a recipe for
going right to sleep, or teaching a lesson, either. The better
strategy was to wait for the next day, when Bela and Steve could
ɹnd the right moment to address the issue. Not during the morning
rush to eat breakfast and make lunches, but after dinner when
everyone could discuss the issue calmly and from a fresh
perspective.
As for their speciɹc response, this is where the second principle
came in: be consistent, but not rigid. Consistency is of course
crucial. Steve and Bela had taken a clear stance about the
importance of Nila being honest and responsible with her phone,
and at least in this instance, she hadn’t lived up to their agreement.
So they needed to address that lapse with a consistent response.
But in doing so, they didn’t want to make a rigid, snap decision
that overshot the mark. Their ɹrst reaction was to take the phone
away altogether. But once they talked, and calmer heads prevailed,
they recognized that in this case, that response would be too
drastic. Outside of this one problem, Nila had acted responsibly
with her phone. So rather than taking it away, they decided to
discuss the issue with Nila, asking for her help coming up with
policies to address the situation. In fact, she was the one who came
up with a ɹx that was easy for everyone: she would leave her
phone outside her room when she goes to bed. Then she wouldn’t
be tempted to check it every time it lit up—and Mom and Dad
could be assured that Nila was recharging while her phone was as
well.
This response made sense given Nila’s general good decision
making. They all agreed that if more problems arose, or if she
demonstrated more extreme misuse of the phone, Steve and Bela
would hold on to the phone except for certain prescribed times of
the day.
With this response, which respected Nila enough to work with
her and collaborate while still enforcing boundaries, Steve and Bela
presented a consistent, united front that adhered to their rules and
expectations, without becoming rigid and disciplining in ways that
wouldn’t beneɹt their daughter, the situation, or their relationship
with her.
As a result, they gave themselves a much better chance at
achieving their three desired outcomes: insight, empathy, and
integrated repair. They helped encourage insight in their daughter
by the collaborative approach they took in asking questions and
engaging in dialogue. The questions focused on helping Nila pause
and think about her decision to power up her phone when she
wasn’t supposed to: “How do you feel inside when you’re doing
something you know you shouldn’t? Or when we walk in and see
you on your phone? What do you think we feel about it?” Other
questions led to insight into better options in the future: “The next
time you’re having trouble sleeping, what could you do instead of being
on your phone?” With questions like these, Nila’s parents helped
increase her personal insight and build her upstairs brain, allowing
her to develop an internal compass and become more insightful in
the future. Plus, by approaching the issue in a way that respected
her and her desires, they increased the chances that Nila will come
and talk with them about even bigger issues later, as she enters her
teen years.
The empathy outcome in this situation is diʃerent from certain
other discipline moments. Often when we encourage empathy in
our children when they’ve made a bad decision, we try to lead
them to think about the feelings of someone else who was hurt
because of their behavior. In this case, no one was really harmed
except for Nila herself, who lost some sleep. But Steve and Bela
tried to lead her to understand that their trust in her had been
dented, at least a bit. They knew better than to overdramatize the
issue, or stoop to using guilt trips or self-pity, and they explicitly
communicated to her that they weren’t going to resort to these
tactics. But they talked with her about how much their relationship
with her means, and explained that it doesn’t feel good when
broken trust harms that relationship in any way.
This part of the discussion about the relationship is a focus on
integration, the connection of diʃerent parts. Integration is what
makes the whole greater than the sum of its parts, and it’s what
creates love in a relationship. Focusing on insight and empathy and
then on their relationship thus led naturally to the third desired
integrative outcome, repair. Once a breach in a relationship has
been created, no matter how small, we want to repair it as soon as
possible. Nila’s parents needed to give her that chance. In their
discussion about what policies to put in place about late-night cell
phone use, they asked questions that helped her think about the
relational eʃects of not following through on commitments. Again,
they avoided manipulating her emotionally by making her feel
guilty, and instead asked good-faith questions like “What’s
something you could do to help us feel good about the trust we
have in you?” They had to “lead the witness” a bit, helping Nila
think about trust-building actions she could take—like using her
phone to just call and check in with her parents from time to time,
or leaving it outside her room at night without having to be asked.
In doing so she thought about ways she could be intentional in
rebuilding her parents’ trust in her.
Notice that this issue with Nila falls into the category of typical
behaviors that parents have to deal with on a daily basis. At times,
there are behavioral challenges where it can be helpful to involve
professionals. More extreme behaviors that are diɽcult to handle
and that last for longer periods of time can sometimes be a sign
that something else is going on. If your child frequently
experiences intense emotional reactivity that does not respond to
repair eʃorts, it can be helpful to talk with a pediatric
psychotherapist or child development specialist who can
supportively explore the situation with you to see whether you and
your child could beneɹt from some intervention. In our experience,
children who display frequent and intense reactivity may be
struggling with more innate challenges related to sensory
integration, attention and/or impulsivity, or mood disorders.
Additionally, a history of trauma, a really diɽcult experience from
the past, or relational mismatches between parent and child can
play a role in behavioral struggles, as they reveal an underlying
challenge with self-regulation that may at times be a source of
repeated ruptures in a relationship. We would encourage you to
seek the help of someone who can help you walk through these
questions and guide you and your child on the path toward optimal
development.
In most discipline situations with your child, though, simply
taking a Whole-Brain approach will lead to more cooperation from
your child and more peace and serenity in your household. 1-2-3
discipline isn’t a formula or a set of rules to be strictly followed.
You don’t have to memorize it and inɻexibly follow it. We’re
simply giving you guidelines to keep in mind when it comes time
for redirection. By reminding yourself about the deɹnition and
purpose of discipline, the principles that should guide it, and your
desired outcomes, you’ll give yourself a much better chance of
disciplining your kids, of teaching them, in a way that leads to
more cooperation from them and better relationships among all
members of the family.
A
CHAPTER 6
Addressing Behavior: As Simple as R-E-D-I-R-EC-T
nna’s eleven-year-old, Paolo, called her from school and asked
whether he could go home with his friend Harrison that
afternoon. The plan, Paolo explained, was to walk to Harrison’s,
where the boys would do homework, then play until dinner. When
Anna asked whether Harrison’s parents were aware of the plan,
Paolo assured her they were, so Anna told him she’d pick him up
before dinner.
However, when Anna texted Harrison’s mother later that
afternoon, telling her she’d be picking up Paolo in a few minutes,
Harrison’s mother revealed that she was at work. Anna then
learned that Harrison’s father hadn’t been home, either, and that
neither of them knew of the boys’ plan for Paolo to come over.
Anna was mad. She knew there might have been some sort of
miscommunication, but it really looked to her like Paolo had been
dishonest. At best he had misunderstood the plan, in which case he
should have let her know when he realized that Harrison’s parents
wouldn’t be home and hadn’t been contacted. At worst he had
outright lied to her.
Once she and Paolo were in the car on the way home from
Harrison’s, she felt like launching into him, leveling consequences
and angrily lecturing him about trust and responsibility.
But that’s not what she did.
Instead, she took a Whole-Brain approach. Since her son was
older and he wasn’t in a reactive state of mind, the “connect” part
of her approach simply entailed hugging him and asking whether
he’d had a good time. Then she showed him the respect of
communicating with him directly. She told him about her text with
Harrison’s mother, then said simply,
“I’m glad you and Harrison
have so much fun together. But I have a question. I know you
know how important trust is in our family, so I’m wondering what
happened here.” She spoke in a calm tone, one that didn’t
communicate harshness and instead expressed her lack of
understanding and her curiosity about the situation.
This curiosity-based approach, where she began by giving her son
the beneɹt of the doubt, helped Anna decrease the drama from the
discipline situation. Even though she was angry, she avoided
immediately jumping to the conclusion that the boys had purposely
deceived their parents. As a result, Paolo could hear his mother’s
question without feeling directly accused. Plus, her curiosity put
the responsibility of accounting for himself squarely on Paolo’s
own shoulders, so he had to think about his decision making, which
gave his upstairs brain a little bit of exercise. Anna’s approach
showed Paolo that she worked from the assumption that he would
make good decisions most of the time, and that she was confused
and surprised when it appeared that he hadn’t.
In this case, by the way, he hadn’t made good decisions. He
explained to his mother that Harrison had thought his father would
be home, but when the boys arrived, Harrison’s father wasn’t
there. He acknowledged that he should have let her know right
away, but he just hadn’t. “I know, Mom. I should’ve told you
nobody else was home. Sorry.”
Then Anna could respond and move from connection to
redirection, saying something like,
“Yes, I’m glad you’re clear that
you should have told me. Tell me more about why that didn’t
happen.” But she knew she wanted her redirection to be about
more than just addressing this one behavior. She rightly recognized
this moment as another opportunity to build important personal
and relational skills in her son, and to help him understand that his
actions had made a little dent in her trust and deviated from their
family agreement to always check in if plans change. That’s why,
before she turned to redirection, she checked herself.
Before You Redirect: Keep Calm and Connect
Have you seen that British poster from World War II that’s become
so popular? The one that says,
“Keep Calm and Carry On”? That’s
not a bad mantra to have at the ready when your child goes
ballistic—or before you do. Anna recognized the importance of
keeping calm when she addressed her problem with Paolo’s
behavior. Blowing up and yelling at her son wouldn’t have done
anyone any good. In fact, it would have alienated Paolo and
become a distraction from what was important here: using this
disciplinary moment to address his behavior, and to teach.
We’ll discuss many redirection strategies below, looking at
diʃerent ways to redirect children when they’ve made bad
decisions or completely lost control of themselves. But before you
decide on which redirection strategies to use as you redirect your
kids toward using their upstairs brains, you should ɹrst do one
thing: check yourself. Remember, just as it’s important to ask,
“Is
my child ready?” it’s also essential that you ask,
“Am I ready?”
Imagine that you walk into your recently cleaned kitchen and
ɹnd your four-year-old perched on the counter, an empty egg
carton and a dozen broken shells by her side, stirring a sand bucket
full of eggs. With her sand shovel! Or your twelve-year-old informs
you, at 6:00 p.m. on Sunday, that his 3-D model of a cell is due the
following morning. This despite the fact that he assured you that
all his homework was done, then spent the afternoon playing
basketball and video games with a friend.
In the middle of frustrating moments like these, the best thing
you can do is to pause. Otherwise your reactive state of mind
might lead you to begin yelling, or at least lecturing about the fact
that a four-year-old (or twelve-year-old) ought to know better.
Instead, pause. Just pause. Allow yourself to take a breath.
Avoid reacting, issuing consequences, or even lecturing in the heat
of the moment.
We know it’s not easy, but remember: when your kids have
messed up in some way, you want to redirect them back toward
their upstairs brain. So it’s important to be in yours, too. When
your three-year-old is throwing a tantrum, remember that she’s
only a small child with a limited capacity to control her own
emotions and body. Your job is to be the adult in the relationship
and carry on as the parent, as a safe, calm haven in the emotional
storm. How you respond to your child’s behavior will greatly impact
how the whole scene unfolds. So before you redirect, check yourself
and do your best to keep calm. That’s a pause that comes from the
upstairs brain but also reinforces the strength of your upstairs
brain. Plus, when you show abilities like this to your children,
they’re more likely to learn such skills themselves.
Staying clear and calm during a pause is your first step.
Then remember to connect. It really is possible to be calm,
loving, and nurturing while disciplining your child. And it’s so
effective. Don’t underestimate how powerful a kind tone of voice
can be as you initiate a conversation about the behavior you’re
wanting to change. Remember that, ultimately, you’re trying to
remain ɹrm and consistent in your discipline while still interacting
with your child in a way that communicates warmth, love, respect,
and compassion. These two aspects of parenting can and should
coexist. That was the balance Anna tried to strike as she spoke with
Paolo.
As you’ve heard us aɽrm throughout the book, kids need
boundaries, even when they’re upset. But we can hold the line
while providing lots of empathy and validation of the desires and
feelings behind our child’s behavior. You might say,
“I know you
really want another ice pop, but I’m not going to change my mind.
It’s OK to cry and be sad and disappointed, though. And I’ll be right
here to comfort you while you’re sad.”
And remember not to dismiss a child’s feelings. Instead,
acknowledge the internal, subjective experience. When a child
reacts strongly to a situation, especially when the reaction seems
unwarranted and even ridiculous, the temptation for the parent is
to say something like “You’re just tired” or “It’s not that big of a
deal” or “Why are you so upset about this?” But statements like
these minimize the child’s experience—her thoughts, feelings, and
desires. It’s much more emotionally responsive and eʃective to
listen, empathize, and really understand your child’s experience
before you respond. Your child’s desire might seem absurd to you,
but don’t forget that it’s very real to him, and you don’t want to
disregard something that’s important to him.
So when it’s time to discipline, keep calm and connect. Then you
can turn to your redirection strategies.
Strategies to Help You R-E-D-I-R-E-C-T
For the remainder of this chapter we’ll focus on what you may
have been waiting for: speciɹc, No-Drama redirection strategies
you can take once you’ve connected with your children and want
to redirect them back to their upstairs brain. To help organize the
strategies, we’ve listed them as an acronym:
Reduce words
Embrace emotions
Describe, don’t preach
Involve your child in the discipline
Reframe a no into a conditional yes
Emphasize the positive
Creatively approach the situation
Teach mindsight tools
Before we get into speciɹcs, let us be clear: this isn’t a list you
need to memorize. These are simply categorized recommendations
that the parents we’ve worked with over the years have found to
be the most helpful. (We’ve included the list, by the way, in the
Refrigerator Sheet at the back of the book.) As always, you should
keep all of these various strategies as diʃerent approaches in your
parental tool kit, picking and choosing the ones that make sense in
various circumstances according to the temperament, age, and
stage of your child, as well as your own parenting philosophy.
Redirection Strategy #1: Reduce Words
In disciplinary interactions, parents often feel the need to point out
what their kids did wrong and highlight what needs to change next
time. The kids, on the other hand, usually already know what
they’ve done wrong, especially as they get older. The last thing
they want (or, usually, need) is a long lecture about their mistakes.

We strongly suggest that when you redirect, you resist the urge
to overtalk. Of course it’s important to address the issue and teach
the lesson. But in doing so, keep it succinct. Regardless of the age
of your children, long lectures aren’t likely to make them want to
listen to you more. Instead, you’ll just be ɻooding them with more
information and sensory input. As a result, they’ll often simply
tune you out.
With younger children, who may not have learned yet what’s OK
and what’s not, it’s even more important that we reduce our words.
They often just don’t have the capacity to take in a long lecture. So
instead, we need to reduce our words.
If your toddler, for instance, hits you because she’s angry that
she doesn’t have your attention while you’re attending to your
other child, there’s simply no reason to go oʃ on a long, drawn-out
oration about why hitting is a bad response to negative emotions.
Instead, try this four-step approach that addresses the issue and
then moves on, all without using more than a few words:


By addressing the child’s actions and then immediately moving
on, we avoid giving too much attention to the negative behavior
and instead quickly get back on the right track.
For younger and older kids both, avoid the temptation to talk
too much when you discipline. If you do need to cover an issue
more fully, try to do so by asking questions and then listening. As
we’ll explain below, a collaborative discussion can lead to all kinds
of important teaching and learning, and parents can accomplish
their disciplinary goals without talking nearly as much as they
typically do.
The basic idea here is akin to the concept of “saving your voice.”
Politicians, businesspeople, community leaders, and anyone else
who depends on eʃective communication to achieve their goals
will tell you that often there are times when they strategically save
their voice, holding back on how much they say. They don’t mean
their literal voice, as if they’ll make their throats hoarse by talking
so much. They mean they try to resist addressing the small points
in a discussion or a voting meeting, so that their words will matter
more when they want to address the really important issues.
It’s the same with our kids. If they hear us incessantly telling
them what to do and what not to do, and then once we’ve made
our point we keep making it over and over again, they will sooner
or later (and probably sooner) stop listening. If, on the other hand,
we save our voice and address what we really care about, then stop
talking, the words we use will carry much greater weight.
Want your kids to listen to you better? Be brief. Once you
address the behavior and the feelings behind the behavior, move
on.
Redirection Strategy #2: Embrace Emotions
One of the best ways to address misbehavior is to help kids
distinguish between their feelings and their actions. This strategy is
related to the concept of connection, but we’re actually making a
completely different point here.
When we say to embrace emotions, we mean that during
redirection, parents need to help their kids understand that their
feelings are neither good nor bad, neither valid nor invalid. They
simply are. There’s nothing wrong with getting angry, being sad, or
feeling so frustrated that you want to destroy something. But
saying it’s OK to feel like destroying something doesn’t mean it’s
OK to actually do it. In other words, it’s what we do as a result of
our emotions that determines whether our behavior is OK or not
OK.
So our message to our children should be,
“You can feel
whatever you feel, but you can’t always do whatever you want to
do.” Another way to think about it is that we want to say yes to our
kids’ desires, even when we need to say no to their behavior and
redirect them toward appropriate action.
So we might say,
“I know you want to take the shopping cart
home. That would be really fun to play with. But it needs to stay
here at the store so other shoppers can use it when they come.” Or
we might say,
“I totally get it that you feel like you hate your
brother right now. I used to feel that way about my sister when I
was a kid and was really mad at her. But yelling ‘I’m going to kill
you!’ isn’t how we talk to each other. It’s perfectly ɹne to be mad,
and you have every right to tell your brother about it. But let’s talk
about other ways to express it.” Say yes to the feelings, even as
you say no to the behavior.
When we don’t acknowledge and validate our kids’ feelings, or
when we imply that their emotions should be turned oʃ or are “no
big deal” or “silly,
” we communicate the message,
“I’m not
interested in your feelings, and you should not share them with
me. You just stuʃ those feelings right on down.” Imagine how that
impacts the relationship. Over time, our children will stop sharing
their internal experiences with us! As a result, their overall
emotional life will begin to constrict, leaving them less able to
fully participate in meaningful relationships and interactions.
Even more problematic is that a child whose parents minimize or
deny her feelings can begin to develop what can be called an
“incoherent core self.” When she experiences intense sadness and
frustration, but her mother responds with statements like “Relax”
or “You’re ɹne,
” the child will realize, if only at an unconscious
level, that her internal response to a situation doesn’t match the
external response from the person she trusts most. As parents, we
want to oʃer what’s called a “contingent response,
” which means
that we attune our response to what our child is actually feeling, in
a way that validates what’s happening in her mind. If a child
experiences an event and the response from her caregiver is
consistent with it—if it’s a match—then her internal experience
will make sense to her, and she can understand herself, conɹdently
name the internal experience, and communicate it to others. She’ll
be developing and working from a “coherent core self.”

But what happens if that match isn’t there and her mother’s
response is inconsistent with the daughter’s experience of the
moment? One mismatch isn’t going to have long-lasting eʃects. But
if over and over again when she gets upset she is told something
like “Stop crying” or “Why are you so upset? Everyone else is
having fun,
” she’s going to begin to doubt her ability to accurately
observe and comprehend what’s going on inside her. Her core self
will be much more incoherent, leaving her confused, full of selfdoubt, and disconnected from her emotions. As she grows into an
adult, she may often feel that her very emotions are unjustiɹed.
She might doubt her subjective experience, and even have a hard
time knowing what she wants or feels at times. So it really is
crucial that we embrace our children’s emotions and oʃer a
contingent response when they are upset or out of control.
One bonus to acknowledging our children’s feelings during
redirection is that doing so can help kids more easily learn
whatever lesson we’re wanting to teach. When we validate their
emotions and acknowledge the way they are experiencing
something—really seeing it through their eyes—that validation
begins to calm and regulate their nervous system’s reactivity. And
when they are in a regulated place, they have the capacity to
handle themselves well, listen to us, and make good decisions. On
the other hand, when we deny our kids’ feelings, minimize them,
or try to distract our kids from them, we prime them to be easily
dysregulated again, and to feel disconnected from us, which means
they’ll operate in a heightened state of agitation and be much more
likely to fall apart, or shut down emotionally, when things don’t go
their way.
What’s more, if we’re saying no to their emotions, kids aren’t
going to feel heard and respected. We want them to know that
we’re here for them, that we’ll always listen to how they feel, and
that they can come to us to discuss anything they’re worried about
or dealing with. We don’t want to communicate that we’re here for
them only when they’re happy or feeling positive emotions.
So in a disciplinary interaction, we embrace our kids’ emotions,
and we teach them to do the same. We want them to believe at a
deep level that even as we teach them about right and wrong behavior,
their feelings and experiences will always be validated and honored.
When kids feel this from their parents even during redirection, they’ll be
much more apt to learn the lessons the parents are teaching, meaning
that over time, the overall number of disciplinary moments will
decrease.
Redirection Strategy #3: Describe, Don’t Preach
The natural tendency for many parents is to criticize and preach
when our kids do something we don’t like. In most disciplinary
situations, though, those responses simply aren’t necessary.
Instead, we can simply describe what we’re seeing, and our kids
will get what we’re saying just as clearly as they do when we yell
and disparage and nitpick. And they’ll receive that message with
much less defensiveness and drama.
With a toddler we might say something like,
“Uh-oh, you’re
throwing the cards. That makes it hard to play the game.” To an
older child we can say,
“I still see dishes on the table,
” or “Those
sound like some pretty mean words you’re using with your
brother.” Simply by stating what we observe, we initiate a dialogue
with our children that opens the door to cooperation and teaching
much better than an immediate reprimand like “Stop talking to
your brother that way.”
The reason is that even young children know wrong from right in
most situations. You’ve already taught them what’s acceptable
behavior and what’s not. Often, then, all you need to do is call
attention to the behavior you’ve observed. This is essentially what
Anna did when she said to Paolo,
“I know you know how
important trust is in our family, so I’m wondering what happened
here.” Kids don’t need their parents to tell them not to make bad
decisions. What they need is for their parents to redirect them, helping
them recognize the bad decisions they’re making and what leads up to
those decisions, so they can correct themselves and change whatever
needs to be changed.
For all kids, and especially younger children and toddlers, you
are of course teaching them good from bad, right from wrong. But
again, a short, clear, direct message is going to be much more
eʃective than a longer, overexplained one. And even with young
children, a simple statement of observation will typically get your
point across—and invite a response from them, either verbally or
behaviorally.
The idea here isn’t that a description of what you see will be
some sort of magical phrase that stops bad behavior in its tracks.
We’re simply saying that parents should, as we put it in Chapter 5,
“think about the how” and be intentional about how they say what
needs to be said.
It’s not that the phrase “Looks like Johnny wants a turn on the
swing” is communicating something fundamentally diʃerent from
the phrase “You need to share.” But the former oʃers several
distinct advantages over the latter. First, it avoids putting a child
on the defensive. She might still feel the need to defend herself,
but not to the same degree as if we were to reprimand her or tell
her what she’s doing wrong.
Second, describing what we see puts the onus for deciding how
to respond to the observation on the child, thus exercising his
upstairs brain. That’s how we help him develop an internal
compass, a skill that can last a lifetime. When we say,
“Jake is
feeling left out; you need to include him,
” we are deɹnitely getting
our message across. But we’re doing all the work for our child, not
allowing him to increase his inner skills of problem solving and
empathy. If instead we simply say,
“Look at Jake sitting over there
while you and Leo play,
” we give our child the opportunity to
consider the situation for himself, and determine what needs to
happen.
Third, describing what we see initiates a conversation, thereby
implying that when our child does something we don’t like, our
default response will be to visit with her about it, allow her to
explain, and gain some insight. Then we can give her a chance to
defend herself or apologize if necessary, and to come up with a
solution to whatever problem her behavior might have caused.



“What’s going on?” “Can you help me understand?” “I can’t
ɹgure this out.” These can be powerful phrases when we’re
teaching our kids. When we point out what we see, then ask our
kids to help us understand, it opens up the opportunity for
cooperation, dialogue, and growth.
Do you see how the two responses, even though their content
isn’t all that diʃerent, would be apt to garner very diʃerent
responses from the children, simply because of how the parents
communicated their message? Once the parents describe what
they’ve observed and ask for help in understanding, they can pause
and allow the child’s brain to do its work. Then they can take an
active role in their response.
This redirection strategy leads directly into the next one, which
is all about making discipline a collaborative, mutual process,
rather than a top-down imposition of parental will.
Redirection Strategy #4: Involve Your Child in the Discipline
When it comes to communicating in a disciplinary moment, parents
have traditionally done the talking (read: lecturing), and children
have done the listening (read: ignoring). Parents have typically
worked from an unexamined assumption that this one-directional,
monologue-based approach is the best—and only viable—option to
consider.
Many parents these days, however, are learning that discipline
will be much more respectful—and, yes, eʃective—if they initiate
a collaborative, reciprocal, bidirectional dialogue, rather than
delivering a monologue.
We’re not saying that parents should forgo their roles as
authority ɹgures in the relationship. If you’ve read this far in the
book, you know that we deɹnitely don’t advocate that. But we do
know that when children are involved in the process of discipline, they
feel more respected, they buy into what the parents are promoting, and
they are therefore more apt to cooperate and even help come up with
solutions to the problems that created the need for discipline in the ɹrst
place. As a result, parents and children work as a team to ɹgure out
how best to address disciplinary situations.
Remember our discussion of mindsight, and the importance of
helping kids develop insight into their own actions and empathy for
others? Once you’ve connected and your child is ready and
receptive, you can simply initiate a dialogue that leads ɹrst toward
insight (“I know you know the rule, so I’m wondering what was
going on for you that led you to this”) and then toward empathy
and integrative repair (“What do you think that was like for her,
and how could you make things right?”).
For example, let’s say your eight-year-old becomes out-of-control
furious because his sister is going on another playdate, and he feels
like he “never gets to do anything!” In his anger, he throws your
favorite sunglasses across the room and breaks them.
Once you’ve calmed down and connected with your son, how do
you want to talk with him about his actions? The traditional
approach is to oʃer a monologue where you say something like,
“It’s OK to get mad—everyone does—but when you’re angry you
still need to control your body. We don’t break other people’s
things. The next time you’re that mad, you need to ɹnd an
appropriate way to express your big feelings.”
Is there anything wrong with this communication style? No, not
at all. In fact, it’s full of compassion and a healthy respect for your
child and his emotions. But do you see how it’s based on top-down,
one-directional communication? You are imparting the important
information, and your child is receiving it.
What if, instead, you involved him in a collaborative dialogue
that asked him to consider how best to address the situation?
Maybe you would begin with the D from R-E-D-I-R-E-C-T and
merely describe what you saw, then ask him to respond: “You got
so mad a while ago. You grabbed my glasses and threw them. What
was going on?”
Since you will have already connected, listened, and responded
to his feelings about his sister’s playdate, he can now focus on your
question. Most likely he’ll come back to his anger and say
something like,
“I was just so mad!”
Then you can simply describe, being intentional with your tone
(since the how matters), what you saw: “Then you threw my
glasses.” Here’s where you’re likely to get some sort of “Sorry,
Mom.”
At this point you can move to the next phase of the conversation
and focus explicitly on teaching: “We all get mad. There’s nothing
wrong with getting angry. But what could you do the next time
you’re that mad?” Maybe you could even smile and throw in some
subtle humor he’d appreciate: “You know, besides destroying
something?” And the conversation could go on from there, with
you asking questions that help your young son think about issues
like empathy, mutual respect, ethics, and handling big emotions.
Notice that the overall message remains the same, whether you
oʃer a monologue or initiate a dialogue. But when you involve
your child in the discipline, you give him the opportunity to think
about his own actions, and whatever resulted from them, at a much
deeper level.
You help him recruit more complex neural pathways that build
mindsight capacities, and the result is deeper and longer-lasting
learning.
Involving your kids in the discipline discussion is also a great
way to dial back any patterns or behaviors that may have
unintentionally been set up in your home. A one-directional, topdown discipline approach might lead you to storm into the living
room and declare,
“You’re spending way too much time on video
games these days! From now on, no more than ɹfteen minutes a
day.” You can imagine the response you might receive.
What if, instead, you waited until dinnertime, and once everyone
was at the table, you said,
“I know you’ve been getting to play
video games a lot lately, but that’s not really working very well. It
puts oʃ homework, and I also want to make sure you’re spending
time on other activities as well. So we need to come up with a new
plan. Any ideas?”
You will probably still experience resistance when you broach
the possibility of curtailing screen time. But you will have initiated
a discussion about the issue, and when your kids know that you’re
talking about cutting back, they’ll deɹnitely be invested in being a
part of the conversation to determine what limits will be set. You
can remind them that you will be making the ɹnal decision, but let
them see that you’re inviting their input because you respect them,
want to consider their feelings and desires, and believe they are
helpful problem solvers. Then, even if they don’t love the ɹnal call
you make, they’ll know they were at least considered.
The same would go for any number of other issues: “I know
we’ve been doing homework after dinner, but that’s not been
working well, so we need a new plan. Any ideas?” Or “I’ve noticed
that you’re not too happy about having to practice piano before
school in the mornings. Is there a diʃerent time when you’d feel
better about practicing? What would work for you?” Often they’ll
come up with the same solution you would have imposed on the
situation anyway. But they will have exercised their upstairs brain
to do so and felt your respect along the way.
One of the best results from involving kids in the discipline
process is that frequently they’ll come up with great new ideas for
solving a problem, ideas you hadn’t even considered. Plus, you
might be shocked to ɹnd out how much they are willing to bend to
bring about a peaceful resolution to a standoff.

Tina tells the story of a time when her four-year-old absolutely
had to have a treat—speciɹcally, a bag of fruit snacks—at ninethirty in the morning. She told him,
“Those fruit snacks are
delicious, aren’t they? You can have them after you have a good
lunch in a little while.”
He didn’t like Tina’s plan and began to cry and complain and
argue. She responded by saying,
“It’s really hard to wait, isn’t it?
You want the fruit snacks, and I want you to have a healthy lunch
first. Hmmm. Do you have any ideas?”
She saw his little cognitive wheels turn for a few seconds, then
his eyes got big with excitement. He called out,
“I know! I can
have one now and save the rest for after lunch!”
He felt empowered, the power struggle was averted, and Tina
was able to give him an opportunity to solve a problem. And all it
cost her was allowing him to have one fruit snack. Not such a big
deal.
Again, there are of course times that you can’t give any wiggle
room, and there may be times to allow your child to deal with a no
or give him the opportunity to learn about waiting or handling
disappointment. But usually when we involve the child in the
discipline, it results in a win-win solution.
Even with very young children, we want to involve them as
much as possible, asking them to reɻect on their actions and
consider how to avoid problems in the future: “Remember
yesterday, when you got angry? You’re not usually someone who
hits and kicks. What happened?” With questions like these, you
give your child the opportunity to practice reɻecting on her
behavior and developing self-insight. Granted, you may not get
great answers from a young child, but you’re laying the
groundwork. The point is to let her think about her own actions.
Then you can ask her what she can do diʃerently the next time
she gets so mad. Discuss what she would like you to do to help her
calm down. This type of conversation will deepen her
understanding of the importance of regulating emotions, honoring
relationships, planning ahead, expressing herself appropriately, and
on and on. It will also communicate how important her input and
ideas are to you. She’ll understand more and more that she’s an
individual, separate from you, and that you are interested in her
thoughts and feelings. Every time you involve your children in the
process of discipline, you strengthen the parent-child bond, while
also increasing the odds that they’ll handle themselves better in the
future.
Redirection Strategy #5: Reframe a No into a Conditional Yes
When you have to decline a request, it matters, once again, how
you say no. An out-and-out no can be much harder to accept than a
yes with conditions. No, especially if said in a harsh and dismissive
tone, can automatically activate a reactive state in a child (or
anyone). In the brain, reactivity can involve the impulse to ɹght,
ɻee, freeze, or, in extreme cases, faint. In contrast, a supportive
yes statement, even when not permitting a behavior, turns on the
social engagement circuitry, making the brain receptive to what’s
happening, making learning more likely, and promoting
connections with others.
This strategy will diʃer according to the age of your children. To
a toddler who is asking for more time at her grandmother’s when
it’s time to leave, you can say,
“Of course you can have more time
with Nana. We need to go now, but Nana, would it be OK if we
came back to your house this weekend?” The child may still have
trouble accepting no, but you’re helping her see that even though
she’s not getting exactly what she wants right now, she’ll be told
yes again before too long. The key is that you’ve identiɹed and
empathized with a feeling (the desire to be with Nana) while
creating structure and skill (acknowledging the need to leave now
and delaying the gratification of the desire).
Or if your son can’t get enough of the Thomas the Tank Engine
hands-on display at the local toy store and is unwilling to set down
Percy the Engine so you can exit the store, you can oʃer him a
conditional yes. Try something like,
“I know! Let’s take Percy up to
the saleswoman over there, and explain to her that you want her to
hold him for you and keep him safe until we come back for story
time on Tuesday.” The saleswoman will likely play along, and the
whole potential ɹasco can be avoided. What’s more, you’ll be
teaching your child to develop a prospective mind, to sense the
possibilities for the future and to imagine how to create future
actions to meet present needs. These are executive functions that,
when learned, can be skills that last a lifetime. You are oʃering
guidance to literally grow the important prefrontal circuits of
emotional and social intelligence.
Notice that this isn’t at all about protecting kids from being
frustrated or providing them with everything they want. On the
contrary, it’s about giving them practice at tolerating their
disappointment when things inevitably don’t go their way. They
aren’t attaining their desires in that moment, and you’re assisting
them as they manage their disappointment. You’re helping them
develop the resilience that will aid them every time they are told
no throughout their lives. You’re expanding their window of
tolerance for not getting their way and giving them practice at
delaying gratiɹcation. These are all prefrontal functions that
develop in your child as you parent with the brain in mind. Instead
of discipline simply leading to a feeling of being shut down, now
your child will know, from actual experiences with you, that the
limits you set often lead toward learning skills and imagining
future possibilities, not imprisonment and dismissal.
The strategy is eʃective for older children (and even adults) as
well. None of us like to be simply told no when we want
something, and depending on what else has been happening, a no
may even push us over the edge. So instead of oʃering an outright
refusal, we can say something like,
“There’s a lot happening today
and tomorrow, so yes, let’s invite your friend over, but let’s do it
on Friday, when you’ll have more time with him.” That’s a lot
easier to accept, and it gives a child practice in handling the
disappointment, as well as in delaying gratification.
Say, for instance, a group of your nine-year-old’s friends are
going to a concert to see the latest pop sensation, who, in your
opinion, represents all the things you want your daughter not to
emulate. Regardless of how you deliver the news, she’s not going
to be happy to hear that she’s not going to the concert. But you can
at least mitigate some of the drama by being proactive and getting
ahead of the curve on the issue.
You might, for example, ask her about upcoming concerts she’d
like to attend, and oʃer to take her and a friend to the movies in
the meantime. If you want to go the extra mile, you could even get
online and look for a diʃerent concert she’d be interested in
attending in the near future. Pay close attention to your tone of
voice. Particularly if you’re having to deny a child something she
really wants, it’s important that you avoid coming across as
patronizing or overly dogmatic in your opinion. Again, we’re not
saying this strategy will make everything easy and keep your child
from feeling angry, hurt, and misunderstood. But by coming up
with some sort of conditional yes, rather than a simple “No, you’re
not going,
” you at least decrease the reactivity and show your child
that you’re paying attention to her desires.
Granted, there are times we simply have to deliver the dreaded
outright no. But it’s more often the case that we can ɹnd ways to
avoid having to turn our kids down without at least ɹnding some
measure of a yes that we can also deliver. After all, the things kids
want are often the things we want for them, too—just at a
diʃerent time. They may want to read more stories, or play with
their friends, or eat ice cream, or play on the computer. These are
all activities we want them to enjoy at some point as well, so
usually we can easily find an alternative time to make it happen.
In fact, there’s an important place for negotiation in parent-child
interactions. This becomes more and more important as kids get
older. When your ten-year-old wants to stay up a little later and
you’ve said no, but then he points out that tomorrow is Saturday
and he promises to sleep an hour later than usual, that’s a good
time to at least rethink your position. Obviously, there are some
non-negotiables: “Sorry, but you can’t put your baby sister in the
dryer, even if you do line it with pillows.” But compromise isn’t a
sign of weakness; it’s evidence of respect for your child and his
desires. In addition, it gives him an opportunity for some pretty
complex thinking, equipping him with important skills about
considering not only what he wants, but also what others want,
and then making good arguments based on that information. And
it’s a lot more eʃective in the long run than just saying no without
considering other alternatives.
Redirection Strategy #6: Emphasize the Positive
Parents often forget that discipline doesn’t always have to be
negative. Yes, it’s usually the case that we’re disciplining because
something less than optimal has occurred; there’s a lesson that
needs to be learned or a skill that needs to be developed. But one
of the best ways to deal with misbehavior is to focus on the
positive aspects of what your kids are doing.
For example, think about that bane of parental existence,
whining. Who doesn’t get tired of hearing our kids shift to that
droning, complaining, singsong tone of voice that makes us grit our
teeth and want to cover our ears? Parents often respond by saying
something like,
“Stop whining!” Or maybe they’ll get creative and
say,
“Turn down the whine,
” or “What’s that? I don’t speak whine.
You’ll have to tell me in another language.”
We’re not saying these are the worst possible approaches. It’s a
problem, though, when we resort to negative responses, because it
gives all of our attention to the behavior we don’t want to see
repeated.
Instead, what if we emphasized the positive? Instead of “No
whining,
” we could say something like,
“I like it when you talk in
your normal voice. Can you say that again?” Or be even more
direct in teaching about eʃective communication: “Ask me again in
your powerful, big-boy voice.”
The same idea goes for other disciplinary situations. Instead of
focusing on what you don’t want (“Stop messing around and get
ready, you’re going to be late for school!”), emphasize what you do
want (“I need you to brush your teeth and ɹnd your backpack”).
Rather than highlighting the negative behavior (“No bike ride until
you try your green beans”), focus on the positive (“Have a few
bites of the green beans, and we’ll hop on the bikes”).

There are plenty of other ways to emphasize the positive when
you discipline. You may have heard the old suggestion to “catch”
your kids behaving well and making good decisions. Anytime you
see your older child, who’s usually so critical of her younger sister,
giving her a compliment, point it out: “I love it when you’re
encouraging like that.” Or if your sixth grader has had a hard time
getting his homework in on time, and you notice that he’s making a
special eʃort to work ahead on the report that’s due next week,
aɽrm him: “You’re really working hard, aren’t you? Thanks for
thinking ahead.” Or when your kids are laughing together rather
than ɹghting, make a point of it: “You two are really having fun. I
k
n
o
w
y
o
u
a
r
g
u

”

In emphasizing the positive, you give your focus and attention to
the behaviors you want to see repeated. It’s a gentle way to also
encourage those behaviors in the future without the interaction
becoming about rewards or praise. Simply giving your attention to
your child and stating what you see can be a positive experience
unto itself.
We’re not saying you’re not going to have to address negative
behaviors as well. Of course you are. But as much as possible,
focus on the positive and allow your kids to understand, and to feel
from you, that you notice and appreciate when they’re making good
decisions and handling themselves well.
Redirection Strategy #7: Creatively Approach the Situation
One of the best tools to keep ready in your parenting toolbox is
creativity. As we’ve said time and again throughout the book,
there’s no one-size-ɹts-all discipline technique to use in every
situation. Instead, we’ve got to be willing and able to think on our
feet and come up with diʃerent ways to handle whatever issue
arises. As we put it in Chapter 5, parents need response ɻexibility,
which allows us to pause and consider various responses to a
situation, applying diʃerent approaches based on our own
parenting style and each individual child’s temperament and needs.
When we exercise response ɻexibility, we use our prefrontal
cortex, which is central to our upstairs brain and the skills of
executive functions. Engaging this part of our brain during a
disciplinary moment makes it far more likely that we’ll also be
able to conjure up empathy, attuned communication, and even the
ability to calm our own reactivity. If, on the other hand, we
become inflexible and remain on the rigid bank of the river, we
become much more reactive as parents and don’t handle ourselves
as well. Ever had that kind of moment? We have, too. Our
downstairs brain will take charge and run the show, allowing our
reactive brain circuitry to take over. That’s why it’s so important
that we strive for response ɻexibility and creativity, especially
when our kids are out of control or making bad decisions. Then we
can come up with creative and innovative ways to approach
difficult situations.
For example, humor is a powerful tool when a child is upset.
Especially with younger children, you can completely change the
dynamics of an interaction simply by talking in a silly voice, falling
down comically, or using some other form of slapstick. If you are
six years old and furious with your father, it’s not as easy to stay
mad at him if he’s just tripped over a toy in the living room and
enacted the longest, most drawn-out fall to the ground you’ve ever
seen. Likewise, leaving the park is a lot more fun if you get to
chase Mom to the car while she cackles and screams in pretend
fear. Being playful is a great way to break through a child’s bubble
of high emotion, so you can then help him gain control of himself.
It applies to interactions with older kids, too; you just have to be
more subtle, and willing to receive an eye roll or two. If your
eleven-year-old is on the couch, less than inclined to join you and
his younger siblings in a board game, you can shift the mood by
playfully sitting on him. Again, this has to be done in a considerate
way and ɹt with his personality and mood, but a playfully
apologetic “Oh, I’m sorry. I didn’t see you there” can at least draw
a pretend-frustrated “Daaaad” and, again, change the dynamics of
the situation.
One reason this type of playfulness and humor can be eʃective
with kids—and adults as well, by the way—is that the brain loves
novelty. If you can introduce the brain to something it hasn’t seen
before, something it didn’t expect, it will give that something its
attention. This makes sense from an evolutionary perspective:
something that’s diʃerent from what we usually see will pique our
interest on a primitive and automatic level. After all, the brain’s
ɹrst task is to appraise any situation for safety. Its attention
immediately goes to whatever is unique, novel, unexpected, or
diʃerent, so that it can assess whether the new element in its
environment is safe or not. The appraisal centers of the brain ask,
“Is this important? Do I need to pay attention here? Is this good or
bad? Do I move toward it or away from it?” This attention to
novelty is a key reason that humor and silliness can be so eʃective
in a disciplinary moment. Also, a respectful sense of humor
communicates the absence of threat, which allows our social
engagement circuitry to engage, which in turn opens us up to
connect with others. Creative responses to disciplinary situations
prompt our kids’ brains to ask these questions, become more
receptive, and give us their full attention.
Creativity comes in handy in all kinds of other ways, too. Let’s
say your preschooler is using a word you don’t like. Maybe she’s
saying things are “stupid.” You’ve tried ignoring it, but you keep
hearing the word. You’ve tried rephrasing it with a more
acceptable synonym—“You’re right, those swim goggles are just
wacky, aren’t they?”—but she keeps saying the goggles are stupid.
If ignoring and re-languaging don’t turn out to be eʃective
strategies, then instead of forbidding the word—you know how
well that works—get creative. One gifted preschool director came
up with an inspired way to address the use of the word. Anytime
he heard a child say something was stupid, he would explain, in a
matter-of-fact tone, that the word is really only meant to be used
in a particular context: “ ‘Stupid’ is such a great word, isn’t it? But
I’m afraid you’re using it wrong, my dear. You see, that’s a very
particular word that’s really meant to be used only when talking to
baby chickens. It’s sort of a farm word. Let’s come up with another
term to use in this situation.”
There are plenty of ways to approach a situation like this. You
might suggest devising a code word that means “stupid,
” so that
you two share a secret language that no one else understands.
Maybe the new term could be “glooby” or some other fun word to
say, or it could even be a hand signal you make up together. The
point is that you ɹnd a way to creatively redirect your child
toward behavior that will work better for everyone involved, and
even give you a fun sense of connection.
Let’s acknowledge one thing, though: sometimes you don’t feel
like being creative. It feels like it takes too much energy. Or maybe
you’re not too happy with your kids because of the way they’re
acting, so you’re not exactly thrilled with the idea of mustering the
energy to help them shift their mood or see things in a new light.
In other words, sometimes you just don’t want to be playful and
fun. You want them to just get in the car seat without a song and
dance! You want them to just put on their stinking shoes! You want
them to just get their homework done, or turn oʃ the video game,
or stop fighting, or whatever!
We get it. Boy, do we get it.
However, compare the two options. The ɹrst is to be creative,
which often demands more energy and goodwill than we can easily
muster when we don’t like the way our kids are acting. Ugh.
The other option, though, is to continue to have to participate in
whatever battle the discipline situation has created. Double ugh.
Doesn’t it usually end up taking much more time and much more
energy to engage in the battle? The fact is, we can often completely
avoid the battle by simply taking just a few seconds to come up with an
idea that’s fun and playful.
So the next time you see trouble coming with your kids, or if
there is a particular issue that you typically end up battling over,
think about your two options. Ask yourself: “Do I really want the
drama that’s on the horizon?” If not, try playfulness. Be silly. Even
if you don’t feel like it, muster up the energy to be creative.
Sidestep the drama that sucks the life out of you and takes the fun
out of your relationship with your child. We promise, this option is
more fun for everyone.
Redirection Strategy #8: Teach Mindsight Tools
The ɹnal redirection strategy we’ll discuss is perhaps the most
revolutionary. You’ll recall that mindsight is all about seeing our
own minds, as well as the minds of others, and promoting
integration in our lives. Once kids begin to develop the personal
insight that allows them to see and observe their own minds, they
can then learn to use that insight to handle difficult situations.
We discussed this idea in detail in our previous book, The WholeBrain Child, focusing on several Whole-Brain strategies parents can
use to help their children integrate their brains and develop
mindsight. As we’ve taught the fundamentals of that book to
audiences of parents, therapists, and educators, we’ve further
refined those ideas.
The overall point of this ɹnal redirection strategy is one that
even small children can understand, although older kids can
obviously grasp the message in more depth: You don’t have to get
stuck in a negative experience. You don’t have to be a victim to
external events, or internal emotions. You can use your mind to take
charge of how you feel, and how you act.
We realize that this is an extraordinary promise to make. But we
are enthusiastic about this approach because of how it has worked
for so many people through the years. Parents really can teach
their kids and themselves mindsight tools that will help them
weather emotional storms and deal more eʃectively with diɽcult
experiences, thus leading them to make better decisions and enjoy
less chaos and drama when they are upset. We can help our children
increasingly have a say in how they feel, and in how they look at the
world. Not through some mysterious, mystical process available
only to the gifted, but by using emerging knowledge about the
brain and applying it in simple, logical, practical ways.
For example, you may have heard about the famous Stanford
marshmallow experiment from the 1960s and 1970s. Young
children were brought into a room one at a time, and a researcher
invited them to sit down at a table. On the table was a
marshmallow, and the researcher explained that he would leave
the room for a few minutes. If the child resisted the temptation to
eat the marshmallow while he was gone, he would give the child
two marshmallows when he returned.
The results were predictably hilarious and adorable. Search
online and you can view video of numerous replications of the
study, which show children variously closing their eyes, covering
their mouths, turning their back to the marshmallow, stroking it
like a stuʃed animal, slyly nibbling at the corners of the
marshmallow, and so on. Some children even grab the sugary treat
and eat it before the researcher can ɹnish delivering the
instructions.
Much has been written about this study and follow-up
experiments focusing on children’s ability to delay gratiɹcation,
demonstrate self-control, apply strategic reasoning, and so on.
Researchers have found that kids who demonstrated the ability to
wait longer before eating the marshmallow tended to have many
improved life outcomes as they grew up, such as doing better in
school, scoring higher on the SAT, and being more physically fit.
The application we want to highlight here is what a recent study
revealed about how children could use mindsight tools to be more
successful at delaying gratiɹcation. Researchers found that if they
provided the kids with mental tools that gave them a perspective
or strategy to assist in containing their impulse to eat the
marshmallow—thus helping them manage their emotions and
desires in that moment—the children were much more successful at
demonstrating self-control. In fact, when the researchers taught the
kids to imagine that it wasn’t an actual marshmallow in front of
them, but instead only a picture of a marshmallow, they were able
to wait much longer than the kids who weren’t given any strategies
to help them wait! In other words, simply by using a simple
mindsight tool, the children were able to more eʃectively manage
their emotions, impulses, and actions.
You can do the same for your kids. If you’ve read The WholeBrain Child, you know about the hand model of the brain. Here’s
how we introduced it in a “Whole-Brain Kids” cartoon for parents
to read to their children.


Dan recently received an email from a school principal about a
new kindergarten student who was struggling. The child’s teacher
had taught her class the hand model of the brain, and she saw
immediate results:
Yesterday a teacher came to me very concerned about
the behavior of a new kindergarten student. He had just
come to our school, and he was crawling under tables
and saying he hated everything. (He is living with a
family member, as his mom is incarcerated, and now
he’s had to leave a teacher he really liked.)
Today our teacher retaught Brain-in-the-Hand. This
was new to him. He was under the table most of the
time while she taught. Soon after, he motioned to her,
showed the ɻipped lid with his hand, and, on his own,
went to the cool-off spot for a long time. (He almost fell
asleep.)
When he ɹnally got up, he approached her while she
was teaching, pointed to his hand/brain with his lid
closed, and joined the group.
After a bit she complimented him for his
participation, and he said,
“I know. I told you.” And he
pointed to his hand/brain with the lid closed.
It was a huge moment, and she and I celebrated for
him that he must really have needed that language!
Later today I went in during choice time and played
“restaurant” with him. At one point he took a single
ɻower out of a vase and handed it to me. My heart
melted. Yesterday his teacher was comparing him to a
child who truly struggles. Today he’s seeking every
opportunity to connect with us. I’m so thankful that
we’re learning this.
What did this teacher do? She gave her student a mindsight tool.
She helped him develop a strategy for understanding and
expressing what was happening around and within him, so he could
then make intentional choices about how to respond.
Another way to say it is that we want to help kids develop a dual
mode of processing the events that occur in their lives. The ɹrst mode
is all about teaching children to be aware of and simply sense their
subjective experiences. In other words, when they’re dealing with
something diɽcult, we don’t want them to deny that experience,
or to squelch their emotions about it. We want them to talk about
what’s going on as they describe their inner experience,
communicating what they’re feeling and seeing in that moment.
That’s the ɹrst mode of processing: to simply acknowledge and be
present with the experience. This teacher, in other words, didn’t
want this little boy to deny how he was feeling. His feeling was his
experience, and this “experiencing mode” is all about simply
sensing inner subjective experience as it is happening.
But also we want our kids to be able to observe what’s going on
within them, and how the experience is impacting them. Brain
studies reveal that we actually have two diʃerent circuits—an
experiencing circuit and an observing circuit. They are diʃerent,
but each is important, and integrating them means building both
and then linking them. We want our kids to not only feel their
feelings and sense their sensations, but also to be able to notice
how their body feels, to be able to witness their own emotions. We
want them to pay attention to their emotions (“I’m noticing that
I’m feeling kind of sad,
” or “My frustration isn’t grape-size right
now; it’s like a watermelon!”). We want to teach them to survey
themselves, and then problem-solve based on this awareness of
their internal state.
That’s what this boy did. He both lived in his experience and
observed it. This allowed him to own what was going on. He had
the perspective to be able to observe his experience as he was
experiencing it. He could bear witness to the unfolding of
experience, not just be in the experience. And then he could narrate
what had happened, using language to express to others and to
himself an understanding of what was going on. Using the hand
model as his tool, he surveyed himself and recognized that he had
“ɻipped his lid,
” and he took steps in response, thus changing his
internal state. Then when he was back in control of his emotions,
he rejoined the group.
We see kids and parents in our work who become stuck in an
experience they’re dealing with. Of course they need to deal with
what’s happened to them. But that’s only one mode of processing.
They also need to look at and think about what’s going on. They
need to use mindsight tools to become aware of and observe,
almost like a reporter, what is happening. One way to explain it is
that we want them to be the actor, experiencing the scene in the
moment, but also to be the director, who watches more objectively
and can, from outside the scene, be more insightful about what’s
taking place on camera.
When we teach kids to be both actor and director—to embrace
the experience and also to survey and observe what’s happening
within themselves—we give them important tools that help them
take charge of how they respond to situations they’re faced with. It
allows them to say,
“I hate tests! My heart is pounding, and I’m
starting to freak out!” but then also to observe,
“That’s not weird. I
really want to do well on it. But I don’t have to freak out. I just
need to skip that TV show tonight and put in some extra study
time.”
Again, this is about teaching kids that they don’t have to be stuck
in an experience. They can also be observers and therefore change
agents. Let’s say, for example, that the child described above
remains overly concerned about tomorrow’s test. He begins a
cascade of worrying that takes him into a spiral of panic about the
test and his semester grade, and what that might mean in terms of
graduating with the right GPA to get into a good college.
This would be a great time for his parents to teach him that he
can change his emotions and his thinking by moving his body, or
simply by altering his physical posture. In The Whole-Brain Child,
we call this particular mindsight tool the “move it or lose it”
technique. The boy’s parents could have him sit “like a noodle,
”
completely relaxed and “ɻoppy,
” for a couple of minutes. They all
could then observe together how his feelings, thoughts, and body
began to feel diʃerent. (It really is amazing how eʃective this
particular strategy can be when we’re tense.) Then they could go
back and talk about the exam from an “unstuck place” where he
could see that he had some options.
There are limitless ways you can teach your kids about the
power of the mind. Explain the concept of shark music, and have a
conversation about what experiences from the past might be
impacting their decision making. Or explain the river of well-being.
Show them the picture from Chapter 3, and walk them through a
discussion of a recent experience when they were especially chaotic
or rigid. Or when they are feeling scared about something, tell
them,
“Show me what your body looks like when you’re brave, and
let’s see what that feels like.” Recent studies are suggesting that
simply holding our bodies in various postures can actually shift our
emotions, along with the way we view the world.
Opportunities to teach mindsight tools are everywhere. In the
car, when your nine-year-old is upset about an important shot she
missed in her basketball game, direct her attention to the splotches
on your windshield. Say something like,
“Each spot on the
windshield is something that has happened or will happen this
month. This one here is your basketball game. That’s real, and I
know you’re upset. I’m glad you’re able to be aware of your
feelings. But look at all the other splotches on the windshield. This
one here is the party this weekend. You’re pretty excited about
that, aren’t you? And that one next to it represents your math
grade from yesterday. Remember how proud you felt?” Then
continue the conversation, putting the missed shot into context
with her other experiences.
The point of an exercise like this isn’t to tell your daughter not to
worry about her basketball game. Not at all. We want to encourage
our kids to feel their feelings, and to share them with us. The
sensing mode that lets us experience directly is an important mode
of processing. But along the way, we want to give them perspective
and help them understand that they can focus their attention on
other aspects of their reality. This comes from having our observing
circuits well developed, too, not just our sensing circuits. It’s not a
matter of one or the other. Both are important, and together they
make a great team. That’s one way we can help our kids develop
integration by diʃerentiating and then linking their sensing and
absorbing capacities. Having built both circuits, our kids can use
their minds to think about things other than what’s upsetting them
in a particular moment, and as a result, they see the world
diʃerently and feel better. When we teach our kids mindsight
tools, we give them the gift of being able to regulate their
emotions, rather than being ruled by them, so they don’t have to
remain victims of their environment or their emotions.
The next time a discipline opportunity comes up in your house,
introduce your kids to some mindsight tools. Or use one of the
other redirection strategies we’ve presented here. You might have
to try several diʃerent approaches. No one strategy will apply in
every situation. But if you work from a No-Drama, Whole-Brain
perspective that ɹrst connects, then redirects, you can more
eʃectively achieve the primary goals of discipline: gaining
cooperation in the moment and building your children’s brains so
they can be kind and responsible people who enjoy successful
relationships and meaningful lives.

CONCLUSION
On Magic Wands, Being Human, Reconnection,
and Change: Four Messages of Hope
e’ve emphasized throughout this book that No-Drama
Discipline allows for a much calmer and more loving
disciplinary interaction. We’ve also said that a No-Drama, WholeBrain approach not only is better for your children, their future,
and your relationship with them, but actually makes discipline
more eʃective and your life easier as well, since it increases the
cooperation you’ll receive from your kids.
Still, even with the best ambitions and the most intentional
methods, sometimes everyone walks away from a disciplinary
interaction feeling angry, confused, and frustrated. In our closing
pages, we want to oʃer four messages of hope and solace for those
diɽcult moments we all inevitably face at one time or another as
we discipline our children.
First Message of Hope: There Is No Magic Wand
One day Tina’s seven-year-old became furious with her because she
told him it wouldn’t work that day to invite a friend over to play.
He stormed oʃ to his room and slammed the door. Less than a
minute later, she heard the door open, then slam again.
Here’s how Tina tells the story.
I went to check on my son, and taped to the outside of
his door, I saw this picture.
(You can see from the drawing below that he regularly
uses his artistic talents to communicate his feelings
about his parents.)
I went into his room and saw what I knew I’d see: a
child-size lump under the covers on his bed. I sat next to
the lump and put my hand on what I assumed was a
shoulder, and suddenly the lump moved away from me,
toward the wall. From beneath the covers, my son cried
out,
“Get away from me!”
At times like this I can become childish and drop
down to my child’s level. I’ve even been known to say
things like,
“Fine! If you won’t let me cut that toenail
that’s hurting, you can stay in pain all week!”
But this particular day, I maintained control and
handled myself pretty well, trying to address the
situation from a Whole-Brain perspective. I ɹrst tried to
connect by acknowledging his feelings: “I know it
makes you mad that Ryan can’t come over today.”
His response? “Yes, and I hate you!”
I stayed calm and said,
“Sweetie, I know this is
upsetting, but there’s just not time to have Ryan over
today. We’re meeting your grandparents for dinner in a
little while.”
In response, he curled tighter and moved as far away
from me as possible. “I said get away from me!”
I went through a series of strategies, the ones we’ve
been discussing in the previous chapters. I comforted,
using nonverbal connection. I tried to relate to his
changing, changeable, complex brain. I chased the why
and thought about the how of my communication. I
validated his feelings. I tried to engage in a
collaborative dialogue and reframed my no, oʃering a
playdate the next day. But at that moment, he couldn’t
calm down and wasn’t ready to let me help him in any
way. No amount of connection did the trick.
Moments like these highlight a reality that’s important for
parents to understand: sometimes there’s just nothing we can do to
“ɹx” things when our kids are having a hard time. We can work to
stay calm and loving. We can be fully present. We can access the
full measure of our creativity. And still, we may not be able to
make things better right away. Sometimes all we have to oʃer is
our presence as our children move through the emotions. When
kids clearly communicate that they want to be alone, we can
respect what they feel they need in order to calm down.
This doesn’t mean we’d leave a child crying alone in his room for
long periods of time. And it doesn’t mean we don’t keep trying
diʃerent strategies when our child needs our help. In Tina’s case,
she ended up sending her husband into her son’s room, and the
change of dynamic helped him begin to calm some, so that later he
and his mom could come back together and talk about what
happened. But for a few minutes, all Tina could do was say,
“I’m
here if you need me,
” then leave him in his room for a few
minutes, shut the door with the anti-Mom sign on it, and let him
ride it out the way he needed to, on his own timing and in his own
way.
The same goes for sibling conɻict. The ideal is to help each
sibling return to a good state of mind, then work with them,
individually or together, and teach them good relational and
conversation skills. But there are times this just isn’t possible. If
even just one of them is emotionally dysregulated, it can prevent
anything like a peaceful resolution, since reactivity is trumping
receptivity. Sometimes the best you can do is separate them until
you can all come together again once everyone has calmed down.
And if cruel fate decrees that you’re all trapped in the minivan
when the conɻict erupts, you may just need to explicitly
acknowledge that things are not going well and turn up the music.
In doing so, you’re not surrendering. You’re just acknowledging
that at this moment, eʃective discipline isn’t going to happen. In
cases like this, you can say,
“This isn’t a good time for us to talk
this through. You’re both mad, and I’m mad, so let’s just listen to
some Fleetwood Mac.” (OK, maybe that’s not the best choice in
music to win your kids over, but you get the idea.)
We, Dan and Tina, are both trained child and adolescent
psychotherapists who write books about parenting. People come to
us for advice on how to handle problems when their kids are
struggling. And we want to make it clear that for us, like you, there
are times when there just isn’t a magic wand we can wave to
magically transport our kids to peace and happiness. Sometimes the
best we can do is to communicate our love, be available when they
do want us close, and then talk about the situation when they’re
ready. It’s just like the Serenity Prayer says: “May I have the
courage to change the things I can, the serenity to accept the things
I can’t, and the wisdom to know the difference.”
So that’s our ɹrst message as we conclude the book: sometimes
there’s no magic wand. And it doesn’t make you a bad parent if you
do your best, and your child stays upset.
Second Message of Hope: Your Kids Benefit Even When You Mess Up
Just as it doesn’t make you a bad parent if your discipline
techniques aren’t always eʃective in the moment, you’re also not a
bad parent if you make mistakes on a regular basis. What you are
is human.
The fact is that none of us are perfect, especially when it comes
time to deal with our kids’ behavior. Sometimes we handle
ourselves well and feel proud of how loving, understanding, and
patient we remain. At other times, we lower ourselves to our kids’
level and resort to the childishness that upset us in the first place.
Our second message of hope is that when you respond to your
kids from a less-than-optimal place, you can take heart: most likely
you’re still providing them with all kinds of valuable experiences.
For example, have you ever found yourself so frustrated with
your kids that you call out, a good bit louder than you need to,
“That’s it! The next one who complains about where they’re sitting
in the car can walk!” Or maybe, when your eight-year-old pouts
and complains all the way to school because you made her practice
the piano, you deliver these sarcastic and biting words as she
departs the minivan: “I hope you have a great day, now that you’ve
ruined the whole morning.”
Obviously, these aren’t examples of optimal parenting. And if
you’re like us, you can be hard on yourself for the times you don’t
handle things like you wish you had.
So here’s hope: those not-so-great parenting moments are not
necessarily such bad things for our kids to have to go through. In
fact, they’re actually incredibly valuable.
Why? Because our messy, human, parental responses give kids
opportunities to deal with diɽcult situations and therefore develop
new skills. They have to learn to control themselves even though
their parent isn’t doing such a great job of controlling herself. Then
they get to see you model how to apologize and make things right.
They experience that when there is conɻict and argument, there
can be repair, and things become good again. This helps them feel
safe and not so afraid in future relationships; they learn to trust,
and even expect, that calm and connection will follow conɻict.
Plus, they learn that their actions aʃect other people’s emotions
and behavior. Finally, they see that you’re not perfect, so they
won’t expect themselves to be, either. That’s a lot of important
lessons to learn from one parent’s loud, impulsive declaration that
he’s sending back all the presents because his kids complained
about having to help put up the holiday decorations.
Abuse, of course, is diʃerent, whether physical or psychological.
Or if you’re signiɹcantly harming the relationship or scaring your
child, then the experience can result in substantially harmful
eʃects. These are toxic ruptures, and ruptures without repair. If
you ɹnd yourself in that situation repeatedly, you should seek the
help of a professional right away in order to make whatever
changes are necessary so that your children are safe and know that
they are protected.
But as long as you nurture the relationship and repair with your
child afterward (more about that below), then you can cut yourself
some slack and know that even though you might wish you’d done
things diʃerently, you’ve still given your child a valuable
experience, by learning the importance of repair and reconnection.
We hope it’s obvious that we’re not saying that parents should
intentionally rupture a connection or that we shouldn’t aim for the
best when we respond to our kids in a high-stress situation (or any
other time). The more loving and nurturing we can be, the better.
Those non-ideal moments of non-optimal interactions will happen
to all of us, even those of us who write books on this subject.
We’re just saying that we can oʃer grace and forgiveness to
ourselves when we’re not acting as we’d like to, because even
those situations provide moments of value as well. Having a goal,
an intention in mind, is important. And being kind to ourselves,
having self-compassion, is essential not only to create an internal
sanctuary, but also to oʃer our children a role model for being
kind to themselves as well as to others. These experiences with us
give our kids opportunities to learn important lessons that will
prepare them for future conɻict and relationships, and even teach
them how to love. How’s that for hope?
Third Message of Hope: You Can Always Reconnect
There’s no way we can avoid experiencing conɻict with our kids.
It’s going to happen, sometimes multiple times per day.
Misunderstandings, arguments, conɻicting desires, and other
breakdowns in communication will lead to a rupture in the
relationship. Ruptures can result from conɻict around a limit that
you’re setting. Maybe you decide to enforce a bedtime or keep
your child from seeing a movie you’ve decided isn’t good for him.
Or maybe your daughter thinks you’re taking her sister’s side in an
argument, or she gets frustrated that you won’t play another game
of Chutes and Ladders.
Whatever the reason, ruptures occur. Sometimes they are bigger,
sometimes smaller. But there’s no way to avoid them. Each child
presents a unique challenge to maintaining attuned connection, one
that depends on our own issues, on our child’s temperament, on the
match between our history and our child’s characteristics, and on
whom our child may remind us of in our own un-worked-through
past.
In most of our adult relationships, if we mess up, we eventually
own up to it, or address it in some way, and then make amends.
But many parents, when it comes to their relationship with their
child, just ignore the rupture and never address it. This can be
confusing and hurtful for children, just like it can be for adults. Can
you imagine someone you care about being reactive and talking to
you really rudely, then never bringing it up again and just
pretending it never happened? That wouldn’t feel great, would it?
It’s the same for our kids.
What’s key, then, is that you repair any breach in the
relationship as quickly as possible. You want to restore a
collaborative, nurturing connection with your child. Ruptures
without repair leave both parent and child feeling disconnected.
And if that disconnection is prolonged—and especially if it’s
associated with your anger, hostility, or rage—then toxic shame
and humiliation can grow in the child, damaging her emerging
sense of self and her state of mind about how relationships work.
It’s therefore vital that we make a timely reconnection with our
kids after there’s been a rupture.
It’s our responsibility as parents to do this. Maybe we reconnect
by granting forgiveness, or by asking for it (“I’m sorry. I think I
was just reacting because I’m extra tired today. But I know I didn’t
handle myself very well. I’ll listen if you want to talk about what
that was like for you”). Maybe laughter’s involved, maybe tears
(“Well, that didn’t go very well, did it? Anyone care to play back
for me how crazy I was?”). Maybe there’s just a quick
acknowledgment (“I didn’t handle that how I would have liked.
Will you forgive me?”). However it happens, make it happen. By
repairing and reconnecting as soon as we can, and in a sincere and
loving manner, we reconnect and send the message that the
relationship matters more than whatever caused the conɻict. Plus,
in reconnecting with our kids, we model for them a crucial skill
that will allow them to enjoy much more meaningful relationships
as they grow up.
So that’s the third message of hope: we can always reconnect.
Even though there’s no magic wand, our kids will eventually soften
and calm down. They’ll eventually be ready to sense our positive
intentions and receive our love and comfort. When they do, we
reconnect. And even though we’re going to mess up as parents over
and over again because we are human, we can always go to our
kids and repair the breach.
In the end, then, it all comes back to connection. Yes, we want
to redirect. We want to teach. Our children need us to help them
learn how to focus their desires in positive ways; how to recognize
and deal with limits and boundaries; how to discover what it
means to be human and to be moral, ethical, empathic, kind, and
giving. So yes, redirection is crucial. But ultimately, it’s your
relationship with your child that must always stay at the forefront
of your mind. Put any particular behavior on the back burner, and
keep your relationship with your child always on the front burner. Once
that relationship has been ruptured in any way, reconnect as soon
as possible.
Fourth Message of Hope: It’s Never Too Late to Make a Positive
Change
Our ɹnal message for you is the most hopeful of all: it’s never too
late to make a positive change. Having read this book, you may
now feel that your discipline approach up to this point has at least
partially run counter to what’s best for your children. Perhaps you
feel that you’re undermining your relationship with them by the
way you discipline. Or maybe you realize that you’re overlooking
and missing out on opportunities to build the parts of their brains
that will help them achieve optimal growth. You might now see
that you’re using disciplinary strategies that are simply not
eʃective, are just contributing to more drama and frustration in
your family, and are actually keeping you from enjoying your kids
because you end up having to deal with the same behaviors over
and over.
If any of that’s the case, have hope. It’s not too late.
Neuroplasticity, as we’ve said, shows us that the brain is amazingly
changeable and adaptive across a lifetime. You can change the way
you discipline at any age—yours or your child’s. No-Drama
Discipline shows you how. Not by oʃering a formula to follow. Not
by providing a magic wand that will solve every problem and make
you a parent who never misses the mark. The hope comes in that
you now have principles that can guide you toward disciplining
your children in ways you can feel good about. You now have
access to strategies that actually sculpt the brain in positive ways,
allow your kids to be emotionally intelligent and make good
choices, strengthen your relationship with them, and help them
become the kind of people you want them to be.
When you respond to your kids with connection—even and
especially when they do something that frustrates you—you put
your primary focus not on punishment or obedience, but on
honoring both your child and the relationship. So the next time
your toddler throws a tantrum, your second grader punches his
sister, or your middle schooler talks back, you can choose to
respond in a No-Drama, Whole-Brain fashion. You can begin with
connection, then move on to redirection strategies that teach kids
personal insight, relational empathy, and the importance of taking
responsibility for the times they mess up.
Along the way, you can be more intentional about how you
activate certain circuits of your kids’ brains. Neurons that ɹre
together wire together. The circuitry that is repeatedly activated
will be strengthened and further developed. So the question is,
which part of your kids’ brains do you want to strengthen?
Discipline with harshness, shouting, arguments, punishment, and
rigidity, and you’ll activate the downstairs, reactive part of your
child’s brain, strengthening that circuitry and priming it to be easily
activated. Or discipline with calm, loving connection, and you’ll
activate the reɻective, receptive, regulating mindsight circuitry,
strengthening and developing the upstairs section of the brain to
create insight, empathy, integration, and repair. Right now, in this
moment, you can commit to giving your children these valuable tools.
You can help them develop this increased capacity to regulate
themselves, to make good choices, and to handle themselves well—even
in challenging times, and even when you’re not around.
You’re not going to be perfect, and you’re not going to discipline
from a No-Drama, Whole-Brain perspective every time you get the
chance. Neither do we. Nobody does.
But you can decide that you’ll take steps in that direction. And
every step you take, you’ll give your kids the gift of a parent who
is increasingly committed to their lifelong success and happiness,
and to making them happy, healthy, and fully themselves.

No-Drama Discipline
by Daniel J. Siegel, M.D., and Tina Payne Bryson, Ph.D.
FIRST, CONNECT
• Why connect first?
• Short-term benefit: It moves a child from reactivity to
receptivity.
• Long-term benefit: It builds a child’s brain.
• Relational benefit: It deepens your relationship with your
child.
• No-Drama connection principles
• Turn down the “shark music”
: Let go of the background
noise caused by past experiences and future fears.
• Chase the why: Instead of focusing only on behavior, look
for what’s behind the actions:
“Why is my child acting this
way? What is my child communicating?”
• Think about the how: What you say is important. But just
as important, if not more important, is how you say it.
• The No-Drama connection cycle: help your child feel felt
• Communicate comfort: By getting below your child’s eye
level, then giving a loving touch, a nod of the head, or an
empathic look, you can often quickly defuse a heated
situation.
• Validate: Even when you don’t like the behavior,
acknowledge and even embrace feelings.
• Stop talking and listen: When your child’s emotions are
exploding, don’t explain, lecture, or try to talk her out of
her feelings. Just listen, looking for the meaning and
emotions your child is communicating.
• Reflect what you hear: Once you’ve listened, reflect back
what you’ve heard, letting your kids know you’ve heard
them. That leads back to communicating comfort, and
the cycle repeats.
THEN, REDIRECT
• 1-2-3 discipline, the No-Drama way
• One definition: Discipline is teaching. Ask the three
questions:
1. Why did my child act this way? (What was happening
internally/emotionally?)
2. What lesson do I want to teach?
3. How can I best teach it?
• Two principles:
1. Wait until your child is ready (and you are, too).
2. Be consistent but not rigid.
• Three mindsight outcomes:
1 . Insight: Help kids understand their own feelings and
their responses to difficult situations.
2 . Empathy: Give kids practice reɻecting on how their
actions impact others.
3. Repair: Ask kids what they can do to make things right.
• No-Drama redirection strategies
• Reduce words
• Embrace emotions
• Describe, don’t preach
• Involve your child in the discipline
• Reframe a no into a yes with conditions
• Emphasize the positive
• Creatively approach the situation
• Teach mindsight tools

WHEN A PARENTING EXPERT LOSES IT
You’re Not the Only One
ust because we write books about parenting and discipline
doesn’t mean there aren’t times when we mess up with our own
kids. Here are two stories—one from each of us—that, while pretty
funny in retrospect, show that the reactive brain can get us all.
Dan’s “Crepes of Wrath” Moment (adapted from Dan’s book
Mindsight)
One day my thirteen-year-old son, my nine-year-old daughter, and
I stopped into a small shop for a snack after a movie. My daughter
said she wasn’t hungry, and so my son ordered a small crepe for
himself from the counter and we sat down. The simple crepe
arrived, aromas wafting from the open kitchen behind the counter
where my son had placed his order. After my son took his ɹrst
forkful of crepe, my daughter asked if she could try some. My son
looked at the small crepe and said that he was hungry and she
could order her own. It was a reasonable suggestion, I thought, so I
oʃered to get another crepe for her—but she said she wanted only
a small bite to see how it tasted. That also seemed reasonable, so I
suggested that my son share a piece with his sister.
If you have more than one child at home, or if you’ve grown up
with a brother or sister, you may be very familiar with the game of
sibling chess, an ever-present strategy match composed of
movements aimed to assert power and achieve parental recognition
and approval. But even if this was not such a sibling assertion
game, the small cost of buying the additional crepe from this little
family-run crepe shop would have been quite a simple one to pay
to avoid what you may guess was about to happen. Instead of
making the purchase, I made a parental blunder and took sides in
this sibling game. I ɹrmly insisted that my son share his crepe with
his sister. If this was not a sibling chess match before, it certainly
became one after I stepped into their interaction.
“Why don’t you just give her a small piece so she can see how it
tastes?” I urged.
He looked at me, then at his crepe, and with a sigh he gave in.
Even as a young teenager he was still listening to me. Then, using
his knife like a scalpel, he extracted the smallest piece of crepe you
can imagine, one you’d almost need tweezers to pick up. Under
other circumstances, I might have laughed and seen this as a
creative move in the sibling chess game.
My daughter took the specimen, placed it on her napkin, and
said that it was too small. And that it was “the burnt part.” Another
great younger-sister move.
An outsider looking in at us at the table may have seen nothing
out of the ordinary: a dad and his two animated kids out for some
food. But inside, I was about to explode. When the bantering
continued, turning into a full-blown argument, something inside me
shifted. My head began to spin, but I told myself that I’d remain
calm and appeal to reason. I could feel my face tense up, my ɹsts
get taut, and my heart begin to beat faster, but I tried to ignore
these signals that my downstairs brain was hijacking the upstairs.
That was it for me.
Feeling overwhelmed by the ridiculousness of the whole
encounter, I got up, took my daughter’s hand, and went outside to
wait on the sidewalk in front of the shop until my son ɹnished his
crepe. A few minutes later he emerged and asked why we had left.
As I stormed oʃ toward the car, my daughter in tow and my son
hurrying to keep up, I told them that they should learn to share
their food with each other. He pointed out in a matter-of-fact tone
that he did give her a piece, but by then I was boiling over with
frustration, and at that point there was no turning oʃ the heat
under the kettle. We got to the car, and, ɹred up, I ignited the
engine and away we went toward home. They had been normal
siblings out for movies and a snack. I became a father out of my
mind.
I couldn’t let it go. Sitting next to me in the passenger seat, my
son countered everything I came up with by some rational,
measured response, as any teenager would do. In fact, he seemed
quite adept at staying calm as he dealt with his now irrational
father.
In that state, I became more and more irate, eventually resorting
to cursing, calling him names, and even threatening to take away
his beloved guitar—all inappropriate consequences for things he
didn’t even do.
I’m not proud to tell you any of this. But Tina and I do feel that
since such explosive episodes are quite common, it is essential that
we acknowledge their existence and help each other understand
how mindsight can diminish their negative impact on our
relationships and on our world. In our shame, we often try to
ignore that a meltdown has occurred. But if we own the truth of
what has happened, we can not only begin to repair the damage—
which can be quite toxic to ourselves as well as to others—but
actually decrease the intensity of such events and the frequency
with which they occur.
So when I got home, I realized that I needed to calm down and
connect with my son. I knew repair was crucial, but my vital signs
were through the roof, and I had to bring them into balance before
doing anything else. Knowing that being outside and exercising
could help alter my state of mind, I went skating with my
daughter, during which time she helped me regain mindsight. I
achieved more personal insight (recognizing that I reacted to my
son the way I did at least partially because I was unconsciously
identifying him with my own older brother) and empathy for how
my son experienced our encounter.
When I ɹnally cooled down after talking and skating and
reɻecting, I went to my son’s room and asked if we could talk. I
said that I thought I had gone oʃ the deep end, and that it would
be helpful for us to discuss what had happened. He told me that he
thought I was too protective of his sister. He was absolutely right.
Although the embarrassment of having become irrational created
an urge to speak up to defend myself and my reactions, I just kept
quiet. My son went on to tell me that my getting “upset” was
unnecessary because he really hadn’t done anything wrong. He was
right. Again I felt a defensive urge to lecture him about sharing.
But I reminded myself to remain reɻective and focus on my son’s
experience, not mine. The essential stance here was not to judge
who was right, but to be accepting and receptive to him. You can
imagine that this all required mindsight, for sure. I was thankful
my prefrontal region was back at work.
After listening to him, I acknowledged that I had in fact taken his
sister’s side (unfairly), that I could see how this felt unjust to him,
and that my explosion seemed irrational—because in fact it was. As
an explanation—not an excuse—I let him know what had happened
in my mind, seeing him as a symbol of my brother, so that we both
could make sense of the whole encounter. Even though I probably
looked awkward and clumsy in his teenage mind, I could tell that
he knew my commitment to our relationship was deep and my
eʃort to repair the damage was genuine. My mindsight had
returned, our two minds connected again, and our relationship was
back on track.
Tina Threatens an Amputation
When my oldest child was three years old, he hit me one day. As a
young and idealistic parent who, at that time, believed that my
best alternative was to have a rational conversation with a threeyear-old in which he would magically see things from my point of
view, I guided him to the bottom of our stairway, sat next to him,
and smiled. I lovingly (and naively) said,
“Hands are for helping
and loving, not for hurting.”
While I was uttering this truism, he hit me again.
So I tried the empathy approach. Still naive, my voice perhaps
sounding a bit less loving, I said,
“Ouch! That hurts Mommy. Be
gentle with my body.”
At which point he hit me again.
I then tried a more ɹrm approach: “Hitting is not OK. We don’t
hit. If you’re mad, you need to use your words.”
Yup, you guessed it. He hit me again.
I was lost. I felt I needed to up the ante, but I didn’t know how.
In my most powerful voice, I said,
“Now you’re in time-out at the
top of the stairs.” (The technical, scientiɹc term for this parenting
strategy is “Flying by the seat of your pants.” Not exactly
intentional parenting.)
I marched him to the top of our stairs. He was probably thinking,
“Cool! We’ve never done this before … . I wonder what will
happen next if I keep hitting her?”
At the top of the stairs, I bent over at the waist, my ɹnger
wagging, and said,
“No more hitting!”
He didn’t hit me again.
He kicked me in the shin.
(As he points out these days when we retell the story, he was
technically obeying my no-hitting instructions.)
At this moment virtually all of my self-control was gone, as were
any viable options I could think of. I grabbed his arm and pulled
him into my room at the top of the stairs, yelling,
“Now you’re in
time-out in Mommy and Daddy’s room!”
Again, I had no strategy, no plan or approach. And as a result,
my young son continued to escalate the situation while his
increasingly red-faced mother yanked him from location to location
in the house.
By this point I was by turns cajoling, scolding, commanding,
reacting, and reasoning (waaaay too much talking): “You may not
hurt Mommy. Hitting and kicking are not how we do things in our
family … . Blah blah blah …”
And that’s when he made his biggest mistake. He stuck out his
tongue at me.
In response, my rational, empathic, responsible, problem-solving
upstairs brain was hijacked by my primitive, reactive, downstairs
brain, and I yelled,
“If you stick that tongue out one more time, I’m
going to rip it out of your mouth!”
In case you’re wondering, neither Dan nor I recommend in any
circumstance threatening to remove any of your children’s body
parts. This was not a good parenting moment.
And it wasn’t eʃective discipline, either. My son dropped to the
ground, crying. I’d scared him, and he kept saying,
“You’re a mean
mommy!” He wasn’t thinking about his own behavior at all—he
was solely focused on my misbehavior.
What I did next was probably the only thing I did right in the
whole interaction, and it’s essential each time we have these types
of ruptures in our relationship with our children: I repaired with
him. I immediately realized how awful I’d been in that reactive,
angry moment. If anyone else had treated my child as I just had, I
would’ve come unglued. I knelt down and joined my young son on
the ɻoor, held him close, and told him how sorry I was. I let him
talk about how much he didn’t like what had just occurred. We
retold the story to make sense of it for him and I comforted him.
I usually get big laughs when I tell this story because parents so
identify with this type of a moment, and I think they enjoy hearing
that a parenting expert can totally lose it, too. As I explain to my
audiences, we need to be patient, understanding, and forgiving—
not only with our children, but with ourselves as well. (People
always ask what I would do diʃerently now. See Chapter 6, where
we discuss addressing toddler misbehavior in four steps—with
illustrations!)
Though these stories are a bit embarrassing to relate, we oʃer
them as (yes, humorous) evidence that we are all potentially prone
to such downstairs dis-integrations when we lose control and
handle ourselves poorly. Episodes like these shouldn’t become a
regular occurrence, though. If you ɹnd yourself repeatedly losing it
in intense ways, we recommend that you consider seeking
professional help to assist you in making sense of your own
emotional needs or woundings that may be contributing to
frequently reactive ways of relating to your children. But if you go
down the low road only every so often, as most of us do, that’s just
part of parenting. The key is recognizing when these moments
happen, putting an end to them as quickly as possible to minimize
the hurt they cause, and then making a repair. We need to regain
what was truly lost—mindsight—and then use insight and empathy
to reconnect with ourselves and repair with those for whom we
care so deeply.
Y
A NOTE TO OUR CHILD’S CAREGIVERS
Our Discipline Approach in a Nutshell
ou are an important person in the life of our child or children.
You’re helping determine who they’re becoming by shaping
their hearts, their character, and even the structures of their brains!
Because we share this incredible privilege and responsibility of
teaching them how to make good choices and how to be kind,
successful human beings, we want to also share with you how we
handle behavioral challenges, in hopes that we can work together
to give our children a consistent, eʃective experience when it
comes to discipline.
Here are the eight basic principles that guide us:
1. Discipline is essential. We believe that loving our kids and giving
them what they need includes setting clear and consistent
boundaries and holding high expectations for them—all of which
helps them achieve success in relationships and other areas of
their lives.
2 . Eʃective discipline depends on a loving, respectful relationship
between adult and child. Discipline should never include threats or
humiliation, cause physical pain, scare children, or make them
feel that the adult is the enemy. Discipline should feel safe and
loving to everyone involved.
3. The goal of discipline is to teach. We use discipline moments to
build skills so kids can handle themselves better now and make
better decisions in the future. There are usually better ways to
teach than giving immediate consequences. Instead of
punishment, we encourage cooperation from our kids by helping
them think about their actions, and by being creative and
playful. We set limits by having a conversation to help develop
awareness and skills that lead to better behavior both today and
tomorrow.
4. The ɹrst step in discipline is to pay attention to kids’ emotions. When
children misbehave, it’s usually the result of not handling big
feelings well and not yet having the skills to make good choices.
So being attentive to the emotional experience behind a behavior
is just as important as the behavior itself. In fact, science shows
that addressing kids’ emotional needs is actually the most
eʃective approach to changing behavior over time, as well as
developing their brains in ways that allow them to handle
themselves better as they grow up.
5. When children are upset or throwing a ɹt, that’s when they need us
most. We need to show them we are there for them, and that
we’ll be there for them at their absolute worst. This is how we
build trust and a feeling of overall safety.
6. Sometimes we need to wait until children are ready to learn. If kids
are upset or out of control, that’s the worst time to try to teach
them. Those big emotions are evidence that our children need us.
Our ɹrst job is to help them calm down, so they can regain
control and handle themselves well.
7. The way we help them be ready to learn is to connect with them.
Before we redirect their behavior, we connect and comfort. Just
like we soothe them when they are physically hurt, we do the
same when they’re emotionally upset. We do this by validating
their feelings and by giving them lots of nurturing empathy.
Before we teach, we connect.
8. After connecting, we redirect. Once they’ve felt that connection
with us, kids will be more ready to learn, so we can eʃectively
redirect them and talk with them about their behavior. What do
we hope to accomplish when we redirect and set limits? We
want our kids to gain insight into themselves, empathy for
others, and the ability to make things right when they make
mistakes.
For us, discipline comes down to one simple phrase: Connect and
redirect. Our ɹrst response should always be to oʃer soothing
connection; then we can redirect behaviors. Even when we say no to
children’s behavior, we always want to say yes to their emotions, and to
the way they experience things.
B
TWENTY DISCIPLINE MISTAKES
Even Great Parents Make
ecause we’re always parenting our children, it takes real eʃort
to look at our discipline strategies objectively. Good intentions
can be replaced by less-than-eʃective habits quickly, and that can
leave us operating blindly, disciplining in ways that might not bring
out our best—or the best in our children. Here are some common
discipline mistakes made by even the best-intentioned, most wellinformed parents. These mistakes crop up when we lose sight of
our No-Drama, Whole-Brain goals. Keeping them in mind can help
us to avoid them or to step back when we start heading down the
low road.
1. Our discipline becomes consequence-based instead of teachingbased.
The goal of discipline is not to make sure that each infraction is
immediately met with a consequence. The real goal is to teach our
children how to live well in the world. But many times we
discipline on autopilot, and we focus so much on the consequences
that those become the end goal, the entire focus. So when you
discipline, ask yourself what your real objective is. Then ɹnd a
creative way to teach that lesson. You can probably ɹnd a better
way to teach it without even using consequences at all.
2. We think that if we’re disciplining, we can’t be warm and nurturing.
It really is possible to be calm, loving, and nurturing while
disciplining your child. In fact, it’s important to combine clear and
consistent boundaries with loving empathy. Don’t underestimate
how powerful a kind tone of voice can be as you have a
conversation with your child about the behavior you want to
change. Ultimately, you’re trying to remain strong and consistent in
your discipline while still interacting with your child in a way that
communicates warmth, love, respect, and compassion. These two
aspects of parenting can and should coexist.
3. We confuse consistency with rigidity.
Consistency means working from a reliable and coherent
philosophy so that our kids know what we expect of them. It
doesn’t mean maintaining an unswerving devotion to some sort of
arbitrary set of rules. So at times you might make exceptions to the
rules, turn a blind eye to some sort of minor infraction, or cut your
child some slack.
4. We talk too much.
When kids are reactive and having a hard time listening, we often
need to just be quiet. When we talk and talk at our upset children,
it’s usually counterproductive. We’re just giving them a lot of
sensory input that can further dysregulate them. Instead, use more
nonverbal communication. Hold them. Rub their shoulders. Smile
or oʃer empathic facial expressions. Nod. Then, when they begin
to calm down and are ready to listen, you can redirect by bringing
in the words and addressing the issue on a more verbal, logical
level.
5. We focus too much on the behavior and not enough on the why
behind the behavior.
Any good doctor knows that a symptom is only a sign that
something else needs to be addressed. Children’s misbehavior is
usually a symptom of something else. It will keep occurring if we
don’t connect with our kids’ feelings and their subjective
experiences that lead to the behavior. The next time your child acts
out, put on your Sherlock Holmes hat and look through the
behavior to see what feelings—curiosity, anger, frustration,
exhaustion, hunger, and so on—might be causing the behavior.
6. We forget to focus on how we say what we say.
What we say to our kids matters. Of course it does. But just as
important is how we say it. Although it’s not easy, we want to aim
for being kind and respectful every time we communicate with our
kids. We won’t always be able to hit this mark, but that should be
our goal.
7. We communicate that our kids shouldn’t experience big or
negative feelings.
When your child reacts intensely when something doesn’t go his
way, do you ever shut down that reaction? We don’t mean to, but
parents can often send the message that we’re interested in being
with our kids only if they’re happy, and not when they’re
expressing negative emotions. We may say things like,
“When
you’re ready to be nice, then you can rejoin the family.” Instead,
we want to communicate that we will be there for them, even at
their absolute worst. Even as we say no to certain behaviors or to
how certain feelings get expressed, we want to say yes to our kids’
emotions.
8. We overreact, so our kids focus on our overreaction, not their own
actions.
When we overshoot the mark with our discipline—if we’re
punitive, or we’re too harsh, or we react too intensely—our
children stop focusing on their own behavior and focus instead on
how mean or unfair they feel we are. So do whatever you can to
avoid building mountains out of molehills. Address the misbehavior
and remove your child from the situation if you need to, then give
yourself time to calm down before saying much, so you can be
calm and thoughtful when you respond. Then you can keep the
focus on your child’s actions rather than your own.
9. We don’t repair.
There’s no way we can avoid experiencing conɻict with our kids.
And there’s no way we’ll always be on top of our game in how we
handle ourselves. We’ll be immature, reactive, and unkind at times.
What’s most important is that we address our own misbehavior and
repair the breach in the relationship as soon as possible, most
likely by oʃering and asking for forgiveness. By repairing as soon
as we can in a sincere and loving manner, we model for our
children a crucial skill that will allow them to enjoy much more
meaningful relationships as they grow up.
10. We lay down the law in an emotional, reactive moment, then
realize we’ve overreacted.
Sometimes our pronouncements can be a bit “supersized”: “You
can’t go swimming for the rest of the summer!” In these moments,
give yourself permission to rectify the situation. Obviously, followthrough is important or you’ll lose credibility. But you can be
consistent and still get out of the bind. For example, you can oʃer
the “one more chance” card by saying,
“I didn’t like what you did,
but I’m going to give you another try at handling things the right
way.” You can also admit that you overreacted: “I got mad earlier,
and I wasn’t thinking things through very well. I’ve thought about
it again and I’ve changed my mind.”
11. We forget that our children may sometimes need our help making
good choices or calming themselves down.
When our kids begin to get out of control, the temptation is to
demand that they “stop that right now.” But sometimes, especially
in the case of small children, they actually may not even be capable
of immediately calming themselves down. That means you may
need to move in and help them make good choices. The ɹrst step is
to connect with your child—with both words and nonverbal
communication—to help him understand that you’re aware of his
frustration. Only after this connection will he be prepared for you
to redirect him toward making better choices. Remember, we often
need to wait before responding to misbehavior. When our kids are
out of control, that’s not the best time to rigidly enforce a rule.
When they are calmer and more receptive, they’ll be better able to
learn the lesson anyway.
12. We consider an audience when disciplining.
Most of us worry too much about what other people think,
especially when it comes to how we parent our kids. But it’s not
fair to your children to discipline diʃerently when someone else is
watching. In front of in-laws, for example, the temptation might be
to be harsher or more reactive because you feel that you’re being
judged as a parent. So remove that temptation. Pull your child
aside and quietly talk to just him, without anyone else listening.
Not only will this keep you from worrying how you sound to the
others in the room, it will also help you get better focus from him,
and you can better attune to his behavior and needs.
13. We get trapped in power struggles.
When our kids feel backed into a corner, they instinctually ɹght
back or totally shut down. So avoid the trap. Consider giving your
child an out: “Would you like to get a drink ɹrst, and then we’ll
pick up the toys?” Or negotiate: “Let’s see if we can ɹgure out a
way for both of us to get what we need.” (Obviously, there are
some non-negotiables, but negotiation isn’t a sign of weakness; it’s
a sign of respect for your child and her desires.) You can even ask
your child for help: “Do you have any suggestions?” You might be
shocked to find out how much your child is willing to bend in order
to bring about a peaceful resolution to the standoff.
14. We discipline in response to our habits and feelings instead of
responding to our individual child in a particular moment.
We sometimes lash out at our child because we’re tired, or because
that’s what our parents did, or because we’re fed up with his
brother, who’s been acting up all morning. It’s not fair, but it’s
understandable. What’s called for is to reɻect on our behavior, to
really be in the moment with our children, and to respond only to
what’s taking place in that instant. This is one of the most diɽcult
tasks of parenting, but the more we can do it, the better we can
respond to our kids in loving ways.
15. We embarrass our kids by correcting them in front of others.
When you have to discipline your child in public, consider her
feelings. (Imagine how you’d feel if your signiɹcant other called
you out on something in front of other people!) If possible, step
out of the room, or just pull her close and whisper. This isn’t
always possible, but when you can, show your child the respect of
not adding humiliation to whatever else you need to do to address
the misbehavior. After all, embarrassment will just take her focus
oʃ the lesson you want to teach, and she’s unlikely to hear
anything you want to tell her.
16. We assume the worst before letting our kids explain.
Sometimes a situation looks bad and it really is. But sometimes
things aren’t as bad as they seem. Before lowering the boom, listen
to your child. She may have a good explanation. It’s really
frustrating to believe you have a rationale for your actions, yet to
have the other person say,
“I don’t care. I don’t want to hear it.
There’s no reason or excuse.” Obviously, you can’t be naive, and
any parent needs to wear her critical-thinking cap at all times. But
before condemning a child for what seems obvious at ɹrst blush,
ɹnd out what she has to say. Then you can decide how best to
respond.
17. We dismiss our kids’ experience.
When a child reacts strongly to a situation, especially when the
reaction seems unwarranted and even ridiculous, the temptation is
to say something like,
“You’re just tired,
” “Stop fussing,
” “It’s not
that big a deal,
” or “Why are you crying about this?” But
statements like these minimize the child’s experience. Imagine
someone saying one of these phrases to you if you were upset! It’s
much more emotionally responsive and eʃective to listen,
empathize, and really understand your child’s experience before
you respond. Even if it seems ridiculous to you, don’t forget that
it’s very real to your child, so you don’t want to dismiss something
that’s important to him.
18. We expect too much.
Most parents would say that they know that children aren’t perfect,
but most parents also expect their children to behave well all the
time. Further, parents often expect too much of their children
when it comes to handling emotions and making good choices—
much more than is developmentally appropriate. This is especially
the case with a ɹrstborn child. The other mistake we make in
expecting too much is that we assume that just because our child
can handle things well sometimes, she can handle things well all
the time. But especially when kids are young, their capacity to
make good decisions really ɻuctuates. Just because they can handle
things well at one time doesn’t mean they can at other times.
19. We let “experts” trump our own instincts.
By “experts,
” we mean authors and other gurus, as well as friends
and family members. It’s important that we avoid disciplining our
kids based on what someone else thinks we ought to do. Fill your
discipline toolbox with information from lots of experts (and nonexperts), then listen to your own instincts as you pick and choose
diʃerent aspects of diʃerent approaches that seem to apply best to
your situation with your family and your unique child.
20. We’re too hard on ourselves.
We’ve found that it’s often the most caring and conscientious
parents who are too hard on themselves. They want to discipline
well every time their kids mess up. But it’s just not possible. So
give yourself a break. Love your kids, set clear boundaries,
discipline with love, and make up with them when you mess up.
That kind of discipline is good for everyone involved.
Y
AN EXCERPT FROM
The Whole-Brain Child: 12 Revolutionary Strategies to Nurture Your
Child’s Developing Mind
by Daniel J. Siegel, M.D., and Tina Payne Bryson, Ph.D.
ou’ve had those days, right? When the sleep deprivation, the
muddy cleats, the peanut butter on the new jacket, the
homework battles, the Play-Doh in your computer keyboard, and
the refrains of “She started it!” leave you counting the minutes
until bedtime. On these days, when you (again?!!) have to pry a
raisin from a nostril, it seems like the most you can hope for is to
survive.
However, when it comes to your children, you’re aiming a lot
higher than mere survival. Of course you want to get through those
diɽcult tantrum-in-the-restaurant moments. But whether you’re a
parent, grandparent, or other committed caregiver in a child’s life,
your ultimate goal is to raise kids in a way that lets them thrive.
You want them to enjoy meaningful relationships, be caring and
compassionate, do well in school, work hard and be responsible,
and feel good about who they are.
Survive. Thrive.
We’ve met with thousands of parents over the years. When we
ask them what matters most to them, versions of these two goals
almost always top the list. They want to survive diɽcult parenting
moments, and they want their kids and their family to thrive. As
parents ourselves, we share these same goals for our own families.
In our nobler, calmer, saner moments, we care about nurturing our
kids’ minds, increasing their sense of wonder, and helping them
reach their potential in all aspects of life. But in the more frantic,
stressful, bribe-the-toddler-into-the-car-seat-so-we-can-rush-to-thesoccer-game moments, sometimes all we can hope for is to avoid
yelling or hearing someone say,
“You’re so mean!”
Take a moment and ask yourself: What do you really want for
your children? What qualities do you hope they develop and take
into their adult lives? Most likely, you want them to be happy,
independent, and successful. You want them to enjoy fulɹlling
relationships and live a life full of meaning and purpose. Now think
about what percentage of your time you spend intentionally
developing these qualities in your children. If you’re like most
parents, you worry that you spend too much time just trying to get
through the day (and sometimes the next ɹve minutes) and not
enough time creating experiences that help your children thrive,
both today and in the future.
You might even measure yourself against some sort of perfect
parent who never struggles to survive, who seemingly spends every
waking second helping her children thrive. You know, the PTA
president who cooks organic, fully balanced meals while reading to
her kids in Latin about the importance of helping others, then
escorts them to the art museum in the hybrid that plays classical
music and mists lavender aromatherapy through the airconditioning vents. None of us can match up to this imaginary
superparent. Especially when we feel like a large percentage of our
days is spent in full-blown survival mode, where we ɹnd ourselves
wild-eyed and red-faced at the end of a birthday party, shouting,
“If there’s one more argument over that bow and arrow, nobody’s
getting any presents!”
If any of this sounds familiar, we’ve got great news for you: the
moments you are just trying to survive are actually opportunities to help
your child thrive. At times you may feel that the loving, important
moments (like having a meaningful conversation about compassion
or character) are separate from the parenting challenges (like
ɹghting another homework battle or dealing with another
meltdown). But they are not separate at all. When your child is
disrespectful and talks back to you, when you are asked to come in
for a meeting with the principal, when you ɹnd crayon scribbles all
over your wall: these are survival moments, no question about it.
But at the same time, they are opportunities—even gifts—because
a survival moment is also a thrive moment, where the important,
meaningful work of parenting takes place.
Parenting and the Brain
Parents are often experts about their children’s bodies. They know
that a temperature above 98.6 degrees is a fever. They know to
clean out a cut so it doesn’t get infected. They know which foods
are most likely to leave their child wired before bedtime.
But even the best-educated, most caring parents often lack even
basic information about their child’s brain. Isn’t this surprising?
Especially when you consider the central role the brain plays in
virtually every aspect of a child’s life that parents care about:
discipline, decision making, self-awareness, school, relationships,
and so on. In fact, the brain pretty much determines who we are
and what we do. And since the brain itself is signiɹcantly shaped
by the experiences we oʃer as parents, knowing about the way the
brain changes in response to our parenting can help us to nurture a
stronger, more resilient brain.
So we want to introduce you to the whole-brain perspective.
We’d like to explain some fundamental concepts about the brain
and help you apply your new knowledge in ways that will make
parenting easier and more meaningful. We’re not saying that the
whole-brain approach will get rid of all of the frustrations that
come with raising kids. But by understanding a few simple and easyto-master basics about how the brain works, you’ll be able to better
understand your child, respond more eʃectively to diɽcult situations,
and build a foundation for social, emotional, and mental health. What
you do as a parent matters, and we’ll provide you with
straightforward, scientiɹcally based ideas that will help you build a
strong relationship with your child that can help shape his brain
well and give him the best foundation for a healthy and happy life.
What Is Integration and Why Does It Matter?
Most of us don’t think about the fact that our brain has many
diʃerent parts with diʃerent jobs. For example, you have a left
side of the brain that helps you think logically and organize
thoughts into sentences, and a right side that helps you experience
emotions and read nonverbal cues. You also have a “reptile brain”
that allows you to act instinctually and make split-second survival
decisions, and a “mammal brain” that leads you toward connection
and relationships. One part of your brain is devoted to dealing with
memory; another to making moral and ethical decisions. It’s almost
as if your brain has multiple personalities—some rational, some
irrational; some reɻective, some reactive. No wonder we can seem
like different people at different times!
The key to thriving is to help these parts work well together—to
integrate them. Integration takes the distinct parts of your brain
and helps them work together as a whole. It’s similar to what
happens in the body, which has diʃerent organs to perform
diʃerent jobs: the lungs breathe air, the heart pumps blood, the
stomach digests food. For the body to be healthy, these organs all
need to be integrated. In other words, they each need to do their
individual job while also working together as a whole. Integration
is simply that: linking diʃerent elements together to make a wellfunctioning whole. Just as with the healthy functioning of the
body, your brain can’t perform at its best unless its diʃerent parts
work together in a coordinated and balanced way. That’s what
integration does—it coordinates and balances the separate regions
of the brain that it links together. It’s easy to see when our kids
aren’t integrated—they become overwhelmed by their emotions,
confused and chaotic. They can’t respond calmly and capably to the
situation at hand. Tantrums, meltdowns, aggression, and most of
the other challenging experiences of parenting—and life—are a
result of a loss of integration, also known as “disintegration.”
We want to help our children become better integrated so they
can use their whole brain in a coordinated way. For example, we
want them to be horizontally integrated, so that their left-brain logic
can work well with their right-brain emotion. We also want them
to be vertically integrated, so that the physically higher parts of their
brain, which let them thoughtfully consider their actions, work
well with the lower parts, which are more concerned with instinct,
gut reactions, and survival.
The way integration actually takes place is fascinating, and it’s
something that most people aren’t aware of. In recent years,
scientists have developed brain-scanning technology that allows
researchers to study the brain in ways that were never before
possible. This new technology has conɹrmed much of what we
previously believed about the brain. However, one of the surprises
that has shaken the very foundations of neuroscience is the
discovery that the brain is actually “plastic,
” or moldable. This
means that the brain physically changes throughout the course of
our lives, not just in childhood, as we had previously assumed.
What molds our brain? Experience. Even into old age, our
experiences actually change the physical structure of the brain.
When we undergo an experience, our brain cells—called neurons—
become active, or “ɹre.” The brain has one hundred billion
neurons, each with an average of ten thousand connections to other
neurons. The ways in which particular circuits in the brain are
activated determines the nature of our mental activity, ranging
from perceiving sights or sounds to more abstract thought and
reasoning. When neurons ɹre together, they grow new connections
between them. Over time, the connections that result from ɹring
lead to “rewiring” in the brain. This is incredibly exciting news. It
means that we aren’t held captive for the rest of our lives by the
way our brain works at this moment—we can actually rewire it so
that we can be healthier and happier. This is true not only for
children and adolescents, but also for each of us across the life
span.
Right now, your child’s brain is constantly being wired and
rewired, and the experiences you provide will go a long way
toward determining the structure of her brain. No pressure, right?
Don’t worry, though. Nature has provided that the basic
architecture of the brain will develop well given proper food,
sleep, and stimulation. Genetics, of course, play a large role in how
people turn out, especially in terms of temperament. But ɹndings
from various areas in developmental psychology suggest that
everything that happens to us—the music we hear, the people we
love, the books we read, the kind of discipline we receive, the
emotions we feel—profoundly aʃects the way our brain develops.
In other words, on top of our basic brain architecture and our
inborn temperament, parents have much they can do to provide the
kinds of experiences that will help develop a resilient, wellintegrated brain. This book will show you how to use everyday
experiences to help your child’s brain become more and more
integrated.
For example, children whose parents talk with them about their
experiences tend to have better access to the memories of those
experiences. Parents who speak with their children about their
feelings have children who develop emotional intelligence and can
understand their own and other people’s feelings more fully. Shy
children whose parents nurture a sense of courage by oʃering
supportive explorations of the world tend to lose their behavioral
inhibition, while those who are excessively protected or
insensitively thrust into anxiety-provoking experiences without
support tend to maintain their shyness.
There is a whole ɹeld of the science of child development and
attachment backing up this view—and the new ɹndings in the ɹeld
of neuroplasticity support the perspective that parents can directly
shape the unfolding growth of their child’s brain according to what
experiences they oʃer. For example, hours of screen time—playing
video games, watching television, texting—will wire the brain in
certain ways. Educational activities, sports, and music will wire it
in other ways. Spending time with family and friends and learning
about relationships, especially with face-to-face interactions, will
wire it in yet other ways. Everything that happens to us aʃects the
way the brain develops.
This wire-and-rewire process is what integration is all about:
giving our children experiences to create connections between
diʃerent parts of the brain. When these parts collaborate, they
create and reinforce the integrative ɹbers that link diʃerent parts
of the brain. As a result, they are connected in more powerful ways
and can work together even more harmoniously. Just as individual
singers in a choir can weave their distinct voices into a harmony
that would be impossible for any one person to create, an
integrated brain is capable of doing much more than its individual
parts could accomplish alone.
That’s what we want to do for each of our kids: help their brain
become more integrated so that they can use their mental resources
to full capacity. With an understanding of the brain, you can be
more intentional about what you teach your kids, how you respond
to them, and why. You can then do much more than merely
survive. By giving your children repeated experiences that develop
integration, you will face fewer everyday parenting crises. But
more than that, understanding integration will let you know your
child more deeply, respond more eʃectively to diɽcult situations,
and intentionally build a foundation for a lifetime of love and
happiness. As a result, not only will your child thrive, both now
and into adulthood, but you and your whole family will as well.
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
We are profoundly grateful to all of the people who have helped
shape this book that we feel so passionate about. Our teachers,
colleagues, friends, students, and family members have
signiɹcantly contributed to how we think about and communicate
these ideas. We’re especially grateful to Michael Thompson, Natalie
Thompson, Janel Umfress, Darrell Walters, Roger Thompson, Gina
Osher, Stephanie Hamilton, Rick Kidd, Andre van Rooyen, Lara
Love, Gina Griswold, Deborah Buckwalter, Galen Buckwalter, Jay
Bryson, and Liz Olson for their feedback on the book. We also
thank our mentors, clinical colleagues, and the students at the
Mindsight Institute and in our various seminars and parenting
groups who have asked questions that push us to seek and learn
more, and provided feedback about many of the ideas that make
up the foundation of the No-Drama, Whole-Brain approach to
parenting. There are so many people who enrich our lives and our
work that we can’t possibly thank you all individually, but we hope
you know how much you mean to us.
We want to thank our friend and literary agent, Doug Abrams,
who brought to the process not only a wealth of writing knowledge
but also a passion and commitment to strengthening families and
nurturing kids who are happy and healthy. We respect him as both
an agent and a humanitarian. We also gratefully acknowledge the
eʃorts and enthusiasm of our editor, Marnie Cochran, who not
only oʃered wise counsel throughout the publication process but
also extended plenty of patience as we worked to ɹnd just the right
way to express the ideas so important to us. And to our fabulous
illustrator, Merrilee Liddiard, we say thanks and more thanks for
bringing her talent and creativity to the project and helping give
the left-brain words of the book a right-brained graphic and visual
life.
In addition, we thank all of the parents and patients whose
stories and experiences helped us provide examples that give
richness and practicality to the ideas and theories we teach. We’ve,
of course, changed your names and the details of your stories here,
but we’re grateful for the power your stories lend to the
communication of the No-Drama approach to discipline.
We want to acknowledge our gratitude for each other. Our
collective passion for these ideas and for sharing them with the
world makes working together a meaningful honor. We are grateful
to our immediate and extended families who have and continue to
inɻuence who we are and celebrate what we do. Just as we have
shaped who our children are and who they are becoming, they
have shaped who we are as individuals and professionals, and we
are deeply moved by the meaning and joy they bring to us. Finally,
we thank our spouses, Caroline and Scott, who contributed in both
indirect and direct ways to the production of this manuscript. They
know what they mean to us, and we could never fully articulate
how important to us they are, as both personal and professional
partners.
Learning in life is cultivated best in our collaborative
relationships with others. Our primary teachers when it comes to
our own parenting have been our children—Dan’s now in their
twenties, Tina’s in their teen and pre-teen years—who have taught
us the vital importance of connection and understanding, patience
and persistence. Throughout the opportunities and the challenges of
being their parents, we have been reminded through their actions
and reactions, their words and their emotions, that discipline is
about teaching, about learning, about ɹnding lessons in our
everyday experiences no matter how mundane or maddening. That
learning is for both child and parent alike. And trying to create the
necessary structure in their developing lives while parenting in a
calm, even-keel,
“low-drama” way has not always been easy—in
fact, it is most likely one of the most challenging jobs any of us
will ever have. And for these reasons, we thank both our children
and our partners throughout this whole journey, for the powerful
ways they each have taught us about discipline as a way of
learning, of teaching, and of making life an educational adventure
and a celebration of discovery. We hope this book will oʃer an
invitation to reimagine discipline as such a learning opportunity so
that you and your children will thrive and enjoy each other
throughout your lives!

No-Drama Discipline


Vanessa: Hi, I'm Vanessa from SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.com.

Dan: And I'm Dan.

Vanessa: My husband, who is also going to
be giving another perspective in today's conversation.

Today we're bringing you an amazing, long,
English conversation, so prepare your ears,

prepare your mind.

We're going to be talking about 12 different
topics, and hopefully providing some new expressions

and new ways to think about life.

I don't know about that, but at least some
English help for you.

Dan: Yeah, it's going to get personal today,
so get ready.

Vanessa: Yes.

All right, are you ready to get started?

Dan: I'm ready.

Vanessa: Let's go.

Our first topic is family, and my question
is, who do you think that you're the most

like?

Dan: Who am I the most like, in appearance?

Vanessa: Yes.

Dan: Both appearance and character?

Vanessa: Yeah, both.

Dan: Okay, so appearance I look mostly like
my mom, I think.

Vanessa: Okay.

Dan: I have more of her skin tone, I have
her eyes.

Vanessa: Yeah.

Dan: And on her side of the family, most of
the people are pretty skinny, and I'm a rather

skinny guy.

My dad's side is German, and they tend to
be a little bit bigger.

So yeah, I definitely got my mom's side.

But character wise, I think I'm a little more
like my dad.

Would you agree?

Vanessa: Yeah, I'd say you have shades of
your dad.

Dan: You know me so well, so you can answer
this, too.

Vanessa: Yeah.

Yeah, I think you have shades of your dad.

Yeah.

Dan: Shades, yeah.

I think I'm more silly than my dad, that's
not very hard because my dad is pretty serious.

Vanessa: Ah, he's got a silly side though.

Dan: He does, yeah.

But for the most part, I think I'm more like
my dad because he has a very calm demeanor,

he's very patient, and he doesn't get stressed
about anything.

And actually, my dad gets so unstressed about
everything, I can't even understand it.

I'm like, "How are you so calm right now?"

And everybody I know thinks that I'm the most
stress free person they know.

Vanessa: But your dad is even more stress
free.

Dan: Yeah, but we're similar, like growing
up when my parents would be going somewhere,

and needing to get out of the house, me and
my dad would be the last one out of the house

every single time.

Then we would be like, "What?

We'll make it.

We'll be okay.

No problem."

Vanessa: And your mom, and brother, and sister
were saying, "Come on, hurry."

Dan: And my mom is like, "Ah, let's go."

My mom is much more high stress, anxious kind
of personality.

Vanessa: That's kind of a typical family situation,
I think.

Dan: Yeah, how about you?

Vanessa: I think I have both my parents in
me as well.

I think I look a lot like my mom.

Dan: Yeah, she looks exactly like her mom,
though, like to a T.

Vanessa: Sometimes when I see pictures of
myself, and then I look at a picture of her

at the same age, I think, "Whoa.

We look really similar."

And she looks a lot like her mom, so I can
kind of imagine what I'll look like when I'm

getting older.

Dan: Yeah.

I mean, you have darker hair, and darker features.

You got that from your dad.

Vanessa: Yeah, somewhat.

But I think a lot of my features are similar
to my mom.

But I think I also got my facial expressions
from my mom.

Dan: Yes.

Vanessa: A lot of comment that, "Wow, Vanessa,
you have a lot of expressions."

Dan: Your mom is very expressive, just like
you.

Vanessa: And I think it's true that I use
a lot of expressions, but it's just natural

for me.

I do this in daily life as I'm talking about
things.

And I think that I get that from my mom, sometimes
I see some of her expressions and I realize,

"Oh, I do that too."

Dan: Yeah, I remember when we lived in South
Korea, every single Korean person was commenting

on Vanessa's expressions.

They're like, "Your face, it's so exciting.

How are you making so many faces?"

Everybody was surprised.

Vanessa: I don't know.

Dan: I guess in Korea they don't make as many
faces.

Vanessa: I don't know, maybe it's just not.

Maybe it's just an unusual trait.

I'm grateful for that, especially as a teacher,
I can hopefully help to explain some different

concepts with my face as well.

But I feel like I also have parts of my dad.

My dad is a pretty rational guy.

Dan: You're rational like your dad.

Vanessa: Yeah, but I think I also have his
sense of humor, sometimes a little strange

sense of humor, but we laugh at the same things,
we enjoy playing games, and being competitive,

so I think that that side of me, maybe some
of the character side of me, is similar to

him.

But I feel like I also have parts of my grandma.

My grandma is a go, go, go, go person.

Dan: Oh, that's true.

Yeah.

Vanessa: She never stops, and I think my biggest
flaw is that I have difficulty slowing down

and relaxing, I just keep going and I think
that-

Dan: That's why she's with me.

Vanessa: ... I need help relaxing.

Dan: I help her relax.

Vanessa: Yeah, so I think that my grandma's
like this too, that she's always going, and

always doing things, and it's healthy to slow
down every now and then.

And so, I need to do that, she probably needs
to do that too sometimes.

But I don't know if I learned that from her,
but maybe that's just part of my-

Dan: I think it's your personality.

Vanessa: ... DNA, my character.

Dan: Yeah, I can remember even when I first
met Vanessa, she was more go, go, go than

she is now.

Vanessa: Oh, you think so?

Dan: Yeah.

More like so this thing, then the next, and
the enthusiasm was always, she was like bouncing

everywhere.

Vanessa: I always have a lot of enthusiasm,
that's true.

Dan: Yes, it was off the charts.

Vanessa: Yeah, so I want to know for you,
who are you most like in your family?

Is it maybe your physical traits or for your
character?

All right, let's go on to our second question.

The next topic is childhood.

I want to know when do you think childhood
ends, and when do you become an adult?

Dan: When does childhood end?

Vanessa: This is a deep question.

Dan: Well, I don't think it can be a specific
age, I think it's different for everyone.

I think it's at any point you can leave this
house of your parents and live on your own,

take care of yourself, and you're not dependent
on somebody else.

Like if you're living with your friends and
bumming off them, you're probably not an adult

yet.

So if I had to pick an age, I'd probably say
16.

Vanessa: Oh.

Dan: Yeah, I'm saying kind of young.

Vanessa: Okay.

Dan: In an ideal world, I think a 16 year
old should be ready.

Vanessa: Okay.

Okay.

I get it.

At 16 were you ready?

Dan: No, of course not.

Vanessa: Ideally.

Dan: Ideally, yeah.

I don't think our society prepares us to be
ready at 16.

It prepares you to be ready at 18.

Vanessa: Or later.

Dan: Right, or later.

But you know, in an ideal world I think you
could be ready at 16, but it's a kind of complicated

world now, so maybe 18 is an acceptable age.

Vanessa: I feel like, for me, I have less
ideas about childhood ending and adulthood

starting that are physical.

I feel like it has more to do with making
your own decisions.

There might be a lot of reasons why you have
to live at home, or you have to be dependent

on someone else, but if you are making your
own decisions you are not a child, you're

an adult.

And I'm sure as our children get older and
become teenagers, that's going to be a little

bit harder for us to make that line for someone
else, but I know for myself-

Dan: Well, this is-
Vanessa: ... making more decisions.

Dan: ... assuming you are capable as a person
to live on your own, of course.

Vanessa: Yeah.

Yeah, I think you can still be an adult just
making your own decisions, but we still need

help from other people as adults, so there's
a... it's a gray area.

Dan: Sure.

Yeah.

I would-
Vanessa: Yeah, it's not so clear.

Dan: ... also add, I don't know, for myself
personally, having children really makes you

an adult.

It doesn't have to be true for everyone, but
I think it's easier for some people to just

kind of be really selfish, and do their own
thing, and kind of live like a kid, especially

nowadays because we have so much entertainment,
you could just watch TV every day.

A lot of guys I know play video games a lot,
and I'm not knocking on video games but playing

video games every day is a good way to remain
a child, at heart anyways.

Vanessa: Sure.

Dan: This is my opinion, it's a little judgemental,
but-

Vanessa: Yeah, I think if you are a good person,
and you have a child, then you feel forced

to be become an adult.

Dan: Yes.

Vanessa: There's still bad people who have
kids, who remain children themselves-

Dan: That's true.

Vanessa: ... and then they're bad parents.

But I think if you're generally a good person,
when you have kids, it's kind of a shock.

Dan: Yeah, well-
Vanessa: Like, "Whoa, this child is so dependent

on me.

I need to be responsible.

I have to organize myself somehow."

You have to change.

Dan: ... I think being an adult, part of it
is having a burden of responsibility of some

kind, whether it's a job, or your house payments,
or whatever it is.

Some people add those burdens of responsibility
anyways without children, but I don't know,

for me, it's just different.

Like, "This is the person I'm taking care
of in my life."

People now-
Vanessa: Yeah.

Dan: ... because we've got two.

Vanessa: Well, two coming up soon.

So I have a question for you, when do you
think childhood ends?

When does adulthood start?

It's going to be different for every culture,
too because this is a pretty cultural specific

question.

Maybe in the U.S.-
Dan: Yeah, maybe you have a-

Vanessa: ... it's different than your country.

Dan: ... maybe you have a rite of passage
in your country.

Vanessa: Oh, can you explain what a rite of
passage is?

Because that's kind of a nuanced thing.

Dan: Yeah, a rite of passage is something
that every boy or every girl does to become

an adult.

Vanessa: Oh, like some ceremony, or activity.

Dan: Yeah, like a ceremony.

Yeah, I mean, we don't really have this in
the U.S., some people say college is a rite

of passage, but not...

I mean, more and more, almost everybody goes
to college now.

Vanessa: A lot of people do, but-
Dan: Yeah, so it kind of is, but it's a really

bad one because usually people just go, and
they have parties, and they live really irresponsibly.

Vanessa: It's not a way to become a responsible
adult.

Dan: Yeah, and then you do more school.

Vanessa: Ah, yes.

Dan: It's not really becoming a man.

Vanessa: Changing your life completely.

Yeah.

So I'm curious, in your country is there something
that signifies, "Now you are an adult.", this

kind of rite of passage ceremony, or festivity,
or party that you have.

In the U.S. we don't really have that, but
I think it's kind of a cool idea that you're

celebrating-
Dan: I wish we did.

Vanessa: ... this big change, going from childhood
to adulthood, and it is a gray area, at least

in the U.S. it's a really gray area, so it's
nice to celebrate that as parents, that your

kids are adults, hopefully.

And that as a child, "Oh, great, now I'm an
adult.

Society sees me as an adult."

So I think it's kind of a cool idea, but maybe
it's something we can do with our future kids.

All right, let's go onto the next topic.

The next topic is jobs.

I want to know what was your worst job ever.

Dan: Worst job ever?

Vanessa: Yeah.

Dan: Well, I have two competing jobs.

Vanessa: Hopefully it's not your current job,
making English lessons.

Dan: It's video editing and doing these videos.

Vanessa: Oh, no.

Dan: I can't stand working with my wife.

Just kidding.

It's the best.

Yeah.

So yeah, really my worst job, if I had to
pick just one, it would be being a dishwasher.

Vanessa: Oh, okay.

Dan: Now notice, there's no differentiation
between the machine, a dishwasher, and the

person who is a dishwasher, it's the same
word.

Vanessa: So you were like the machine, you
were washing dishes.

Dan: Yeah.

I mean, you did have a machine, so you'd have
something on the side you'd slide the dishes

in and all that, but it's just, I was also
like, I think I was 16 at the time, an adult

and I had no friends in the restaurant.

They were all older and they were all really
tough.

I don't know, in America, when you... the
kitchens have a reputation for having really

kind of tough kitchen cooks, and they all...
they swear a lot, and they make foul jokes-

Vanessa: They've had a lot of life experiences.

Dan: ... and I was just like a little Christian
16 year old kid, washing dishes in the corner,

trying to look like relatively normal.

But I didn't talk to anybody-
Vanessa: And you were homeschooled.

Yeah, no experiences.

Dan: Yeah, well at that time I was in high
school.

Vanessa: Oh, yeah, yeah.

Dan: But it was a small, private school.

Anyway-
Vanessa: You were very different from the

other people.

Dan: ... not only was that really awkward,
it was also bad because washing dishes just

kind of stinks.

You just get all the dishes, and some of the
guys used to make fun that I wasn't going

fast enough.

One guy said, "Dan, you have two speeds, slow
and stop."

Vanessa: You're like a turtle?

Dan: Yeah, I'm like a turtle.

Vanessa: Well, sometimes I still say that.

Dan: I wasn't fast enough, and another time
I reached into the mucky, dirty water and

I cut my finger on a broken glass and I was
bleeding in the water.

Vanessa: Oh.

Things you don't want to know when you visit
a restaurant.

Dan: And I was paid under the table.

Vanessa: Oh, really?

Dan: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

Vanessa: Why'd they have to pay you under
the table?

Dan: I don't know, because it's an Italian
restaurant-

Vanessa: Because you were too young?

Dan: ... in rural Pennsylvania.

Vanessa: They didn't want to pay taxes on
their employees or something?

Dan: Yeah.

Vanessa: Oh.

Dan: Plus who wants to pay taxes on a dishwasher?

Vanessa: I wonder if it was because you were
16, like was there an age limit?

Dan: I might have even been 15 at the time.

Vanessa: Okay, maybe you were under the legal
age that they could hire someone-

Dan: Could be.

Vanessa: ... so they just paid you under the
table.

Dan: Yeah, so that was pretty bad.

Vanessa: That sounds pretty bad.

Dan: Yeah, it was an awkward job.

Vanessa: Especially as a first job, it just
seems uncomfortable.

Dan: That was my second job.

Yeah.

Vanessa: Yeah.

Well-
Dan: How about you?

Vanessa: ... I feel like-
Dan: Could it beat that?

Vanessa: Well, I feel like my worst job wasn't
bad because of the social situation like yours,

it was bad because it was so boring.

I worked for a summer at this office, I was
like a temporary employee just for the summer,

working kind of like a call center job.

But every day they gave us these scripts and
we had to call companies who maybe this company

bought a printer within the last couple months.

Dan: I'm bored just listening about it.

Vanessa: Yeah, and I called the company and
said company and said, "Oh, I saw that you

recently bought the HP Inkjet printer, and
we have a upcoming training session on this

day.

Would you like to attend the training session
about this printer?"

Dan: She does have a really good call voice,
though.

Vanessa: And I called so many companies again
and again, talking with secretaries, talking

with other people, just saying, "Do you want
to go to this seminar about..." some electronic

device that they had recently bought.

Dan: If you called me, I'd be like, "Yeah,
I do.

Can I buy more?"

Vanessa: Well, people were generally nice
to me, it was just... it wasn't a subject

that I was interested in, it wasn't something
I was trained to do, so I didn't feel like

it was my specialty, it was just a temporary
job to make money.

Dan: And you were sitting in an office all
day, right?

Vanessa: Yeah, it was my first office job.

Dan: Vanessa doesn't like to sit very long.

Vanessa: No, I have to go, go, go, like we
talked about.

So sitting in that office desk, it was just
not my thing.

But the office, on the other hand, did really
try to make it interesting for the employees,

because they knew most of the people I worked
with were in a similar position as me, where

it wasn't their life-long dream to work in
that job.

So about once a week, we had these game show
competitions-

Dan: That sounds fun.

Vanessa: ... where at lunch, during the lunch
break, everyone would go to the lunchroom,

if you wanted to of course, and they had these
competitions kind of like Wheel of Fortune,

or Jeopardy, and the company just had them
for the employees.

Sometimes we had dress up days where we dressed
up like cowboys, or dressed up like... they

were trying to make it interesting.

Dan: Come on, this is better than being a
dishwasher.

Vanessa: It's probably better than being a
dishwasher, but I just felt like they were

trying so hard to keep employees-
Dan: To make it interesting.

Vanessa: ... to make it interesting-
Dan: All right.

Vanessa: ... because they knew this is not
an interesting job.

Dan: Yeah, can I say my second worst job?

Vanessa: Oh, yeah.

Sure.

Dan: Can you guess what it is?

Vanessa: I know you worked at a lot of coffee
shops, but those weren't that bad.

Dan: Working at a coffee shop is good.

It's fun.

Vanessa: Okay, well what was it?

Dan: It's the sharpshooter.

Vanessa: Oh, can you explain about that job?

Dan: Yeah, so I don't know if you've ever
seen this in your country, but have you ever

been to a place where somebody takes your
picture, and then later they try to sell you

that picture?

I was that guy.

So we took the same pictures, it was going
onto a boat on one of the rivers in Pittsburgh.

Vanessa: So it was kind of like a cruise boat,
but a river cruise.

Dan: Yeah, kind of.

It was very kitschy though, like not high
class at all.

So people, before they got on the boat, we
forced them to stop and go through the line,

and we'd take their picture.

And it was required, but people were like,
"I don't want to get my picture taken."

Vanessa: And everyone had their own cameras
and phones.

Dan: And this is...

Yeah.

Mind you, this is in like 2010, where people
already have phones on their cameras and stuff.

I mean, that's at least getting more popular.

Vanessa: Yeah, they didn't need your picture.

Dan: No.

So I had to take everybody's picture, and
then when they got off the boat, I stood at

the side and said, "Hey, come over here, buy
this picture."

And they were like $20 for one picture.

Vanessa: Crazy.

Dan: A terrible rip-off, even I knew it was
a terrible rip-off, just not a worthwhile

business, at least in 2010 when I was doing
that job.

Vanessa: Yeah, maybe 10 years before that
it would have been cool.

Dan: Yeah, it was a viable business like 30
years ago.

Vanessa: But not now.

Dan: Yeah, but not any more.

That was really bad, and one time somebody
stole one of my pictures and I actually got

fired from that job.

Vanessa: Because they stole a picture.

Dan: Because they stole a picture and I couldn't...

I didn't catch them on time, and I was like,
"Good riddance."

Vanessa: Yeah, "Goodbye to this job.

Goodbye forever."

Dan: Yeah.

The only reason this was better than the other
job, than dish washing, is because I worked

with some people who were funny and we got
along pretty well.

Vanessa: And you were outside, you were by
the river.

Dan: It was okay.

Vanessa: Except you did have to drive an hour
to get there, that's crazy.

Dan: I did drive an hour to work.

Vanessa: You should never drive an hour to
get to a part-time job.

Dan: But that was my fault, I wanted to work
in Pittsburgh, and I still lived... did I

live with my parents?

Vanessa: Yeah, I think so.

Dan: I think I did.

I wasn't an adult yet.

Vanessa: Oh.

Oh.

All right.

Well, I'm curious for you, what is the worst
job that you've ever had?

Let us know.

And let's go to the next topic.

The next topic is travel.

I want to know what are three locations that
you would like to visit or revisit in the

U.S.?
Dan: In the U.S.?

Vanessa: Yes.

Dan: Why just the U.S.?
Vanessa: Well, the world's a big place, so

I had to narrow down the question somehow.

Dan: Okay.

All right.

The first place I'd say is the Grand Canyon.

Vanessa: Okay.

Dan: Because of course you have to see the
Grand Canyon, right?

I've never been there.

I used to live in Colorado, but my family
never made a trip to the Grand Canyon, and

it just would be an amazing sight, I'm sure
of it.

Vanessa: Yeah.

Yeah.

Dan: Second would be the Pacific Northwest,
just in general.

Vanessa: Okay.

Dan: Because I've heard it-
Vanessa: Not like Portland, Seattle, and specific?

Just-
Dan: I think I would like to go to Seattle

because it's a big city and the city sounds
cool.

Not many cities in the U.S. are that interesting
to me because I've traveled in other places

in Europe and in Asia.

And those cities are so much more vibrant,
except for New York City, which is an awesome

city.

Vanessa: Yeah, I'm sure a lot of students-
Dan: Sorry, U.S.

Vanessa: ... want to visit the U.S. and they
want to see these places.

Dan: But I'm also from America, so it's like
not as-

Vanessa: It's always less interesting, yeah.

Dan: Yeah, it's less interesting to me.

But Seattle seems like a really cool town,
and it's higher on my list than, say, Los

Angeles, which just kind of seems like a big,
sprawling, stinky place.

Vanessa: It seems like a lot more-
Dan: No offense, L.A.

Vanessa: It seems a lot more intimidating,
at least.

Dan: Okay, that's a nice way to put it.

Vanessa: Like there's a lot going on there,
but Seattle feels more comfortable.

Dan: Yeah, it seems pretty hip, too.

Vanessa: The Northwest.

Dan: Yeah, the Northwest also because there's
big mountains there, and then there's really

lush and green forests.

Vanessa: Oh.

Okay, cool.

Dan: And I love taking hikes, and if you go
at the right time of the year, because I've

heard it's very rainy in the Pacific Northwest,
I'd like to go and take a nice hike up to

a big mountain-
Vanessa: Yes.

Dan: ... and maybe hop over to Canada, go
to Vancouver, Vancouver Island.

Vanessa: That'd be cool.

Dan: All of that area sounds really, really
cool to me.

Vanessa: Yeah, I'd be up for that.

Dan: Yes.

Vanessa: Let's do it.

Dan: Let's do it.

Vanessa: Tomorrow.

Dan: Okay.

Vanessa: Maybe not tomorrow-
Dan: Okay.

Vanessa: ... but I think that'd be really
cool.

Dan: And third would be Colorado.

Vanessa: So revisit Colorado?

Dan: This is a revisit.

I used to live in Colorado.

I grew up there for five years of my life,
and it was when I was a kid, and I used to

really consider it my home.

But now I haven't been back in probably 15
years, or so.

Vanessa: Oh, that's a long time.

Dan: It's been a really long time since I've
been back, and I'd like to go and maybe travel

to where I was when I was a kid.

It's gotten so much bigger than it was when
I was a kid, so I'm sure there's so many more

people there.

But also, there's really great nature, there's
a lot of really big mountains in Colorado,

there's the Garden of the Gods, which has
really interesting rock formations.

As you can tell, we're very nature driven,
we want to go see natural places.

Vanessa: Yeah, yeah.

Well, a lot of my places have to do with nature
too.

Dan: Yes, let's hear them.

Vanessa: I almost said the Grand Canyon, but-
Dan: You knew I was going to say it.

Vanessa: ... I kind of figured you'd say,
and I think it would be really cool to camp

in the Grand Canyon, or go for a long hike
in the Grand Canyon because you can't just-

Dan: With two children?

Vanessa: Well, maybe when they're older, or
maybe we'll just leave them at home.

Dan: They can take it.

Vanessa: Because when you are just... when
you're looking down at the Grand Canyon, that's

incredible, but I imagine going down into
the Grand Canyon, that would also be just

another part of that-
Dan: Oh, yeah.

We'd have to-
Vanessa: ... it would be so amazing.

Dan: ... hike down in the Grand Canyon.

Vanessa: Yeah, that'd be really cool.

Dan: I should have mentioned that for sure.

Vanessa: Maybe with a donkey.

Dan: Because we're big hikers, we like to
hike everywhere.

Vanessa: Yeah.

Yeah.

Well, one of my places is kind of the opposite
of yours.

It's not a big city, but you said the Pacific
Northwest, and I said the Northeast.

I've never been to Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont,
this area.

And I feel like one of the best road trips
would be driving all the way up the East Coast

of the U.S., and going around Maine, and coming
down through Vermont.

I think all of that geography is just really
different than everywhere else I've visited

in the U.S. I've heard the coasts, like the
Northeast coasts are really rocky, and lots

of just kind of rugged coastline, that I think
would be really cool to see.

And the forests, I've heard the forests in
Vermont are amazing, just a different type

of feel.

We live in the mountains here in North Carolina,
which is also a great place to visit-

Dan: Yes.

Vanessa: ... but we already are here.

Dan: We live here.

Vanessa: But I feel like the mountains, and
the forests, and the coast, and other places

are pretty various.

Dan: Yeah, it's also close to Canada.

Vanessa: Yeah, that'd be cool.

Dan: Got to hop over to Quebec-
Vanessa: Yeah, maybe do that.

Dan: ... because that sounds like a really
cool place.

Vanessa: Yeah.

Dan: Vanessa speaks French, so-
Vanessa: That'd be cool.

Dan: ... she'd like to speak some French to
some Quebecois.

Vanessa: That would be fun.

Well, one of my others was kind of similar
to what you were saying with Colorado and

that area, is going to Yosemite National Park.

I feel like it's just a classic place to visit
in the U.S. because there's so many national

parks on the West Coast, it's kind of hard
to choose.

So I feel like-
Dan: Yeah, well that one's a must, I think.

Vanessa: Yeah, it's kind of one of the top
three.

Dan: Although I've heard it's gotten crazy
popular.

Vanessa: Oh, yeah.

Dan: You have to be on lists to get in.

Vanessa: Whoa, really?

Dan: Maybe it's to just camp, I don't know.

Vanessa: Oh, yeah.

Dan: Your dad went through a lot of stuff,
didn't he?

Vanessa: Yeah, when they camped, they had
to...

I think the camping spots were opened, say
like May 3rd, the camping spots were opened

and you had to go online to sign up, and the
website opened... or the camping registration

opened at 6:00 AM, he booked at like 6:05
and there were two spots yet.

Everyone was cramming to camp in that spot.

Dan: Camping season.

Vanessa: So yeah, I guess it's really popular.

And that was for the whole year, that wasn't
just for that day.

That was to book a spot to camp for that whole
year.

Anyway, that's crazy.

So maybe we'll do that.

Maybe we need to book it five years in advance,
but I think it'd be cool to visit national

parks in the west because most tourism, well
there's a lot of city tourism in the U.S.,

but I feel like a lot of tourism is natural
tourism.

Dan: Yeah, the meat of our tourism is nature.

Vanessa: Yeah.

Yeah, because I feel like the U.S. is such
a young country that we don't have Rome, we

don't have these old cities, and this kind
of stuff you can visit in cities, it's more

nature, which is also old.

Dan: Except New York City.

Vanessa: Yeah, except New York's got a lot
of cool stuff.

Dan: As you can tell, I'm a big fan of New
York.

It's just-
Vanessa: It's a cool place to visit.

Dan: ... it's a wild animal.

Vanessa: Yeah.

Dan: There's some quote about New York City,
it's like, "You'd be crazy to live here, you'd

be crazy to leave."

Which is perfect.

Vanessa: Oh, well I heard another quote that
said, "New York is twice as fun, but it's

three times as expensive."

So it's really fun, but it's even more expensive.

Dan: That's also true.

Vanessa: Especially if you live there.

Well, my third and final place is, can you
guess?

Dan: I don't remember.

Vanessa: Hawaii.

Dan: Oh, I read your list before, but I don't
remember.

Vanessa: Well, I feel like Hawaii, it's in
the U.S., but it's not.

Dan: Yeah.

Vanessa: It's so far away, but it's still
part of the U.S. and it would be incredible

to visit Hawaii.

Dan: It's kind of like cheating, it's like,
"I'm in the U.S."

Vanessa: And it's so far away from the U.S.
Dan: But it's like, "This isn't America, come

on."

Vanessa: Yeah, it would be really cool.

I'm curious, if you've ever been to Hawaii
if you'd recommend it.

I know your parents are planning on going
there next May.

Dan: Yeah, and get this, my mom was like,
"And I booked these extra rooms just in case

somebody wanted to join."

She winked at us.

Vanessa: We will have a two month old baby
when they go.

Maybe we'll go to Hawaii, I don't know.

It's a little soon, I think.

Dan: I'm saying, "Yes-
Vanessa: We'll let you know.

Dan: ... let's go."

You'll find out.

Vanessa: I think it'd be really cool to go
to Hawaii, just to see volcanoes, and hiking,

and moving around, and scuba diving, and it's
so different.

Dan: That would be the problem.

Trying to do all we want to do.

But if my parents are there, they can watch
the kids.

Vanessa: They can watch our kids, so we're
going to crash their vacation and make them

watch our kids-
Dan: Yes.

Yes.

Vanessa: ... while we go have fun?

Dan: Vacation crashers.

Vanessa: Sounds great, so I'm curious for
you, what are some locations that you'd like

to visit in the U.S.? Or maybe somewhere that
you've already been that you'd like to go

back to.

Let us know.

Let's go on to the next topic.

The next topic is food.

Dan: Yes.

Vanessa: I want to know, what are some of
your favorite foods, specifically to cook

at home?

Dan: To cook at home?

Well-
Vanessa: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

Not to eat, not that someone else makes, but
that we cook at home.

Dan: Yes, usually I go for bulk items.

Vanessa: Okay.

Dan: Not bulk items, bulk meals.

Something that I can get for days, and days,
and days.

Vanessa: Or you could put it in the freezer
and have the next week.

Dan: This is a very, I think, a male way to
think about it.

You've got to make a bulk and make it last.

Vanessa: Ah, utilitarian cooking.

Dan: Yes.

Although, you're kind of similar, I think.

Vanessa: I don't like making a new meal every
single day.

Dan: Yeah.

Vanessa: If we have a soup that's in the freezer
that we made the week before, that's great,

save some time.

Dan: Sure, yeah.

The first thing I like to make, I think we
have the same one-

Vanessa: Oh, yeah?

Dan: ... is chili.

Vanessa: Oh, yeah.

Dan: Yeah, we both like to make chili.

Vanessa: Yeah, some people call this chili
con carne in other countries, but in the U.S.

we just say, "Chili."

Dan: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

Usually I make the chili, so I mean, it's
so easy to make, you just ground up some beef,

then you chop a bunch of vegetables, add a
ton of spices, throw it in a pot and make

it boil, and it's done.

Vanessa: Yeah.

Yeah, it's great.

And it gets even better as it kind of melds
those flavors together over a couple days.

Dan: Yeah.

And you throw in some cheese, and sour cream,
and some kind of grain, some rice or something.

And yeah, it's always very satisfying, it
reminds me of fall and winter.

It's a very nice, cozy meal.

Vanessa: Yeah.

Hot tip, don't leave it on your counter for
three days and then try to eat it.

It should always go in the fridge after you
eat it.

Dan: Who did that?

Vanessa: Dan did that in college-
Dan: Oh.

Vanessa: ... and got sick.

Dan: I didn't leave it on the counter, my
roommate left the chili out.

Vanessa: Oh, and you just ate it?

Dan: Yeah, he left the pot out.

It was already like, this is college life
here, it was already probably a week old and

he left it on the counter all day, and he
didn't tell me-

Vanessa: Not a good idea.

Dan: ... and then I went and ate it that night,
and then I got really sick.

Vanessa: But you still like chili, so it didn't-
Dan: But I still like chili.

Vanessa: ... taint your idea of chili.

Dan: It probably did for like a year.

Vanessa: Really?

Dan: Yeah.

Yeah.

Vanessa: I feel like we're especially thinking-
Dan: TMI?

Vanessa: ... thinking about those types of
foods because it's getting colder here, so

making lots of warm, hearty foods, as opposed
to in July-

Dan: Yes.

Vanessa: ... we don't make chili because it's
so hot.

Dan: Yeah.

Vanessa: You make other kinds of fresh things.

Dan: I have trouble making summer food, because
I like hot food.

Vanessa: Ah, like soups and that kind of stuff.

Dan: Although, when we lived in South Korea,
I think, didn't they have something where

they eat something super hot in the summer?

Vanessa: I think hot or spicy, is that-
Dan: And it's like I'm just eating, and you're

sweating, and the water's pouring off your
face.

And, "Yeah, this is healthy."

It's a very Korean thing.

They've got to be diligent.

Vanessa: Wow.

Well, what are some of your other favorite
foods?

You said chili.

We're on the first one.

Dan: Number two would be tacos.

Vanessa: Oh.

Dan: I got a Mexican food thing, I think,
although I don't consider chili a Mexican

food, but you said chili con carne, so-
Vanessa: Maybe.

Yeah.

Dan: ... I don't know.

Maybe it's Mexican inspired.

Vanessa: Yeah.

What kind of tacos do you like to make, because
there's so many different types-

Dan: Ground beef, again, just all the spices,
and it's kind of one of those easy things

to make, and then you can pile all kinds of
toppings, you can put salsa on it.

Yeah, it's just delicious.

Vanessa: I like when you make fish tacos.

Dan: Yeah, fish tacos are good too.

Vanessa: Sometimes when Dan makes fish tacos,
or sometimes I make them too, we get some

kind of white fish like cod or tilapia, and
bread it, and then bake it so it's baked,

and then you have some kind of cabbage slaw
mixed up on top with some spices in it, and

you put that on the tortilla with the fish,
with the kind of spicy cabbage, maybe slices

of avocado.

Dan: Yeah, and the mayo.

Vanessa: Yeah, some mayo, maybe some-
Dan: Spicy mayo.

Vanessa: ... pico de gallo, some salsa on
top, that's also great.

We make that a lot in the summer, because
that is kind of a fresh type of thing.

Dan: Yeah, well speaking of fish-
Vanessa: Yes?

Dan: ... my third would be salmon.

Vanessa: Oh, how do you like to make salmon?

Dan: Well, I think you can make it in a lot
of different ways, but just throw it in the

oven with some... like lately we've been adding
lemon slices and dill, and just keeping it

basic.

Vanessa: Sometimes we put-
Dan: Oh, and butter.

Vanessa: Oh, butter.

Of course, butter.

Dan: That's important.

Vanessa: Sometimes we do it in the opposite
way with soy sauce, and sesame oil, kind of

more-
Dan: You do it that way.

Vanessa: ... Asian style.

Dan: Yeah.

Vanessa: And that's also great with rice,
or some kind of veggie.

Dan: I do it more European style.

Vanessa: Yeah, well I think you can't go wrong
with salmon.

Dan: Yeah, but it's just a very healthy meal
that tastes very filling, and fulfilling.

Vanessa: Yeah, I think your answers have been
much more varied than mine.

Dan: Oh, yeah?

Vanessa: Because I was going to say soup,
soup, and soup.

Dan: Oh.

Vanessa: I think that, especially now because
it's the begging of the winter, those are

the types of things that we like to eat.

But recently, I've been making a lot of butternut
squash soup, and it's a type of squash, and

you just peel it, and then you chop it up,
and you steam it with some cumin, and paprika,

and coconut milk, and red peppers-
Dan: It's a nice appetizer.

Vanessa: ... and you can also maybe dip some
bread in it's mixed together, because you

have to blend it.

It's really great.

It feels kind of cleansing, especially if
you've eaten-

Dan: It's not filling enough to me.

Vanessa: It's nice to have with something
else sometimes.

Dan: I need some meat in my life.

Vanessa: Typical answer, right?

I think we also made a really great, it's
called Italian vegetable soup, but I don't

know if it's actually Italian, I don't know
why it's considered Italian.

Dan: It's probably Italian American.

Vanessa: Yeah.

Dan: Everything American's say is Italian,
I bet you every Italian out there is like,

"That is not Italian."

Vanessa: Yeah, that-
Dan: "What is this?"

Vanessa: That is not-
Dan: Is that Italian?

Vanessa: ... an Italian accent, but that's
okay.

Dan: Zut alors.

Vanessa: That is-
Dan: Oh, that's French.

Vanessa: Yeah, certainly not Italian.

Though when we make the Italian vegetable
soup, it's basically every vegetable you can

imagine mixed in a pot, even with some tomatoes,
and cabbage, and everything, peppers, and

everything mixed together, and some ground
beef.

So it kind of has a hearty, beefy flavor,
but it also has a lot of vegetables so it

feels healthy and filling with some nice bread
to dip it in.

Dan: It was very good.

Vanessa: Yeah.

Dan: Although, I will say that you can probably
tell from this conversation that we are not

chefs.

Vanessa: No.

Dan: We don't prepare like really good meals
very often.

Vanessa: Or something that's fancy.

Dan: They're delicious, but they're not...
they don't have, you know, what's a sous vide,

or something.

Vanessa: Oh, something that's really exciting.

Dan: Yeah.

Vanessa: Well-
Dan: Although I did make risotto, that was

really good.

Vanessa: Oh, yeah.

You've made risotto a lot.

Dan: I made some really good risotto, and
I felt like it took a lot of work, and that

was fun.

Vanessa: I think it took some particular attention
to detail and I won't do that.

Dan: You know, you use lemon zest, any time
you use lemon zest, I feel like you're probably

crossing over to chef territory.

Vanessa: Oh, okay.

Well, you have crossed over into chef territory
a few times.

I remain clearly on the other side, just happily
eating whatever you make.

But I'm curious for you, what are some of
your favorite foods to eat at home?

What are some of your favorite foods to make
at home?

Maybe it's something that comes from your
country, or maybe it's just something that

you like to make, like toast, something simple.

Let us know.

Dan: Toast.

Vanessa: Yes.

All right, let's go to the next topic.

The next topic is housing.

I want you to dream big, if you could have
your dream home, what three features would

it have?

Let's say this is a dream home, this is idealistic,
this is not realistic.

Dan: This is probably not going to happen
to us.

Vanessa: No, but it's just a dream.

Everyone can dream, right?

Dan: Yeah.

Vanessa: What would you ideally love to have?

Dan: A palace.

A castle.

Vanessa: Hopefully you can hire some people
to clean it at that point.

Dan: Okay, not really.

So the features of the home?

Vanessa: Yes, what three features would you
love to have if you could dream and build

your own home?

Dan: Okay.

Well, first, I would want the living room,
and I don't know is a living common in other

countries?

Vanessa: Yeah, a place where you have a couch,
and maybe a TV.

Dan: This is where you gather together, where
you have the couch, and where you visit with

friends.

I would like this room to be humongous, and
have a really large window.

Vanessa: Are we talking soccer field size
humongous, or are we talking like twice as

big as a normal one?

Dan: I'm talking football stadium big.

Vanessa: Okay.

Dan: No, not really.

Just large.

Large ceilings, vaulted ceilings as they say
in the industry.

Vanessa: Okay.

Dan: And a very large window.

Vanessa: Okay.

Dan: Or large windows.

Vanessa: I said the same thing.

I would like a main room with a big window.

Dan: Yes, but there's more.

Vanessa: Okay.

Dan: And it needs a great view, an incredible
view.

Vanessa: Oh, what's a good view for you?

What would be an ideal view?

Dan: I really love looking out at the ocean,
that would be great.

I'm not a big fan of where I live on the East
Coast of America, the beaches are all kind

of the same to me.

They're not my favorite.

This would be in the Mediterranean, on a big
cliff.

Vanessa: Oh, so it wouldn't be-
Dan: Yeah, a cliff side home.

Vanessa: ... in the U.S., okay.

Dan: Yeah, it wouldn't be in the U.S., sorry
U.S.

Well, maybe somewhere in the U.S. I don't
know.

Vanessa: Could be Pacific Northwest, you've
never been there.

You don't know.

Dan: It may be the Pacific Northwest, maybe
that's my kind of ocean view.

Vanessa: Yeah, so you'd like an ocean view?

Dan: It'd be really high.

Looking down on my kingdom.

Vanessa: So you'd need to be a king too?

Dan: I have to be a king in this scenario.

Vanessa: This is getting a little excessive.

Dan: So yeah, a really big, open ocean view.

Remember, this is dreaming.

Vanessa: This is dreaming.

All right, keep dreaming.

What else would you like?

Dan: All right, so it's very open, so close
by would be a very epic, open kitchen.

Vanessa: Oh, so open you mean it's connected
to the living space?

Dan: Yeah, this is popular, I think, nowadays
in architecture.

Vanessa: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

Dan: Yeah, so open to the living room.

Vanessa: So as you're cooking-
Dan: At least-

Vanessa: ... you can still talk to your guests.

Dan: Yeah, at least part of the kitchen would
be visible.

Vanessa: Yeah, so at the moment, our kitchen
is open to the living room.

Dan: Yes, we have this now.

Vanessa: We don't have an epic, giant-
Dan: Except for the view.

Vanessa: ... living room with a view of the
Mediterranean.

Dan: And the big kitchen.

Vanessa: Yes, but we have an open space, so
it's kind of like one room.

Our kitchen is connected to our living space,
so when our guests, or our friends, or our

family, or our kids are in the living space,
the living room, we can see them and still

kind of interact.

So this type of layout is pretty popular,
at least in newer houses, or as people remodel

their houses, they're kind of looking for
this open layout, is what it's called.

Dan: Yeah, it's called an open floor plan.

Vanessa: Open floor plan, that's the word.

Yeah.

So anything else you would like in this amazing
house?

Dan: Yes, there's one more thing in my palace.

Vanessa: Okay, in your kingdom.

Dan: In my kingdom.

So there would be a game room, because I love
games a lot.

Vanessa: Okay, what kind of games?

Dan: All kinds of games.

So we actually rented a place like this that
was very similar.

Vanessa: Oh, like your grandparents rented
that beach house.

Dan: Actually my grandma rented it.

It was a beach house, so it was like four
layers of house.

Vanessa: That's crazy.

Dan: It was humongous.

It was called The Ritz-
Vanessa: Of course.

Dan: ... which is like a fancy thing.

So the very top floor of this building was
just this giant game room.

They had a pool table, they had a-
Vanessa: A ping-pong.

Dan: Oh, that was... the ping-pong table was
somewhere else.

But in palace, the ping-pong table would be
in the same room.

Vanessa: So ping-pong, foosball, pool.

Dan: Other games too, chess, yeah.

Vanessa: Oh, board game cabinets.

Dan: There would be all kinds of games.

There'd be a TV with video games, it'd just
be fun everywhere.

Vanessa: Okay, so you want a whole big room?

Dan: And then I'd have to lock it up so I
didn't go in, because I'd spend all my time

in there.

Vanessa: Okay, so you'd have to request the
key from one of the people?

Dan: You.

Vanessa: From me?

Okay.

Dan: "Gate keeper, let me in the game room."

Vanessa: I'm sorry to say, but in my dream
home-

Dan: There's no game room?

Vanessa: ... there is not a game room, although
it's a fun idea.

It's a good idea.

Dan: Save that for the vacation home?

Vanessa: Yeah, that's good if your grandparents
rent a house for a week and invite all the

family.

Dan: Yes, it was perfect for that.

Vanessa: That's a good thing to have, but
maybe not in my forever house.

Dan: Okay, what's your forever dream home
look like?

Vanessa: Well, I did say I'd like a main room
with a big window.

I think that would be really great.

So we have some-
Dan: But what's your ideal view?

Vanessa: I didn't really say.

I feel like it doesn't have to be the beach,
maybe not someone else's house right there,

but it could be the mountains, that would
be nice.

Dan: Sure.

Vanessa: But I also like-
Dan: Any kind of picturesque view.

Vanessa: ... I don't like to be isolated,
so if you have a beautiful mountain view,

that means you probably live in the middle
of the mountains away from everybody.

Dan: It's true.

Vanessa: So I don't mind if the view's not
perfect, but I'd just like to have a big window

with lots of light, that'd be really great.

The other thing that I said is a little more
practical, and that is a huge studio room

with different walls that I can film on.

Dan: Very practical for the Fearless Fluency
Club.

Vanessa: Yes.

Dan: Oh, wait, and for YouTube.

Vanessa: Yes.

So for, of course, the fearless fluency club,
and also for YouTube, having different locations

where I can easily film.

And the room where we often film videos, in
here, it's okay.

It's not super small, but I have an image
of-

Dan: It's pretty small.

Vanessa: ... four different walls with different
backgrounds and different things that I can

move lights and easily have different locations
to film, I think that would be really cool.

So I'm starting out small, we have this room,
and then maybe someday in my dream home.

Dan: Yeah, this is way better than our other
house.

Vanessa: Oh, yeah, where we used to live in
the apartment.

Dan: She used to film in a closet.

Vanessa: It wasn't a closet, but it was really
small.

Dan: Two closets combined.

Vanessa: Yeah, it was like a little triangle
room.

Dan: It was very small.

Vanessa: But-
Dan: Hey, we made it work.

Vanessa: Yeah, it worked.

We made it work.

And the other feature that I would like is,
in a dream home, is a roof deck.

Dan: That's cool.

Vanessa: Yeah, so some stairs, and then a
little roof-

Dan: This is the adventurer in Vanessa speaking.

Vanessa: ... on the top so you can look down
everywhere.

Dan: But that's in my house, too.

Vanessa: Oh, it's in your house?

Oh, good.

Maybe we can have a house together.

And also at night you could lay up there and
see the stars.

I think that would be really cool-
Dan: Yeah, that would be neat.

Vanessa: ... so you could have a perfect place
to stargaze.

Dan: I don't know why more houses don't have
this.

Vanessa: Yeah, we should put a deck on top
of our house.

Dan: Yeah, why not?

Vanessa: Yeah.

Dan: Maybe some architect out there has a
reason.

"Well, actually it's bad for structural integrity."

Vanessa: I think that people just don't value
stargazing like we do.

Dan: Maybe.

Vanessa: It's really cool to see the stars
at night, and especially if you're... if you

just have a perfect view from a rooftop deck.

Dan: You're perched in a high place.

Vanessa: Yeah, that'd be really cool.

Well, it was nice to dream.

Thanks for dreaming with me.

Dan: Yeah.

Oh, dream's over.

Vanessa: Yeah.

I'm curious for you, if you could have your
dream home, what features would you like in

that home?

All right, let's go to the next topic.

The next topic is nature.

Dan: Nature.

Vanessa: I want to know what are two cool
facts about animals or nature?

Dan: You want to know two facts?

Vanessa: Yeah, so we did a little bit of research
before this, because we love watching animal

documentaries.

Dan: Okay, well I have a story behind my first
factoid.

Vanessa: Okay.

Dan: One time I was talking to my mom, I don't
remember how this came up, but we were talking

about turtles.

And I don't know why we were talking about
turtles, but she said, "Did you know that

turtles breathe through their butts?"

My mom said this.

And we, for days, we were like, "Mom, turtles...
where did you hear that?

That is so-
Vanessa: Were you a kid?

Dan: That was like, no, I was older.

Vanessa: Okay.

Dan: Probably a teenager, I guess.

Vanessa: Okay.

Dan: But we, me and my siblings, we all just
made fun of her.

We were like, "Mom, you just made that up.

Where on Earth did you hear that?"

But really, it's actually true.

A turtle can breathe through its butt.

Vanessa: What?

Dan: It's true.

Vanessa: Wait, why do they do this?

Dan: Okay, so it's when they're hibernating.

I looked it up to verify because I remember
hearing that that actually was true.

So in the winter, it gets really cold, obviously,
and they live under water.

So it's like really cold, it's almost freezing,
and they can't use their lungs.

So they basically suck water up their butts,
and the water gives them oxygen, therefore-

Vanessa: Oh, why?

Dan: ... they breathe through their butts
in the winter when they're hibernating.

Vanessa: Wow, and your mom was right.

Dan: So my mom was right, but we just... we
did not believe her when she said that.

Vanessa: I mean, it's really bizarre, so why
would you believe her?

Dan: Yeah.

Also, it was very random of her.

She was like, "Don't turtles breathe through
their butts?"

Vanessa: And we were like, "Mom, you just
made that up.

There's no way."

Dan: But it's true.

Vanessa: But it's true.

Dan: So this is turtles who specifically live
in the water?

Not box turtles, or those types of things.

Vanessa: No.

Yeah, turtles but not ocean turtles either.

Dan: Okay, so just ones that live in fresh
water-

Vanessa: Yes.

Dan: ... and live in the water?

Vanessa: Oh, okay.

Dan: This is a very... yeah, tell your friends.

Vanessa: Oh.

Dan: Turtles breathe through their butts.

Vanessa: Before you get to your second fact,
I'm going to share one of mine-

Dan: Okay.

Vanessa: ... which is amazing about butterflies
and caterpillars.

We recently-
Dan: We're like a nature documentary now.

Vanessa: Well, I included this because-
Dan: Should we talk like David Attenborough?

Vanessa: I feel really nerdy about animals.

Dan: "The beautiful butterflies."

Vanessa: Yeah, if you've ever seen nature
documentaries by BBC, David Attenborough is

one of the main commentators.

He's been a staple of nature documentaries
for over a decade, two decades, three decades

maybe, the '70s.

So we are big fans of him and his work, but
I included this topic because we're nerdy

about animals and nature, and like that stuff,
and I thought it would be fun to talk about.

Dan: Sure.

Vanessa: Well, a couple months ago, we found
four monarch butterfly caterpillars in our

backyard.

And they didn't look so good, they looked
like they needed a little bit of help, so

we gave them some milkweed leaves, which is
what monarch butterflies eat, or monarch caterpillars

eat, and we put them in this... we have a
butterfly net, it's like a little container

where you can grow butterflies.

Dan: Grow and release.

Vanessa: Yes.

And so we put the caterpillars in there, gave
them a lot of leaves, and they turned into

cocoons.

Then two of them died, but two of them became
butterflies, it was really amazing, so that

kind of sparked my interest in learning more
about that.

We kind of all know caterpillars become butterflies,
but did you know that a caterpillar, when

it creates a cocoon, it will liquefy it's
body.

It's like a soup inside the cocoon, and it
is digesting, it's eating itself inside the

cocoon, and its DNA just kind of mixes around
and becomes a butterfly.

Dan: Yeah, so it's not like wrapping a blanket
around itself.

Vanessa: No.

Dan: Because-
Vanessa: It's crazy.

Dan: ... usually when I thought of a cocoon,
you would think that the caterpillar spins

something around itself, but no, it's literally
liquefying its body on the inside, and then

turning into, I believe the technical term
is a pupa.

Vanessa: A pupa.

Yeah, so inside when it actually makes that
cocoon, so we saw this happen, where the cocoon

pops out of the caterpillars body, and the
skin and the head pop off, and they fall onto

the ground because-
Dan: It's kind of like a Halloween story.

Vanessa: It is.

It's pretty horrific, if you think about it.

Dan: It was almost Halloween.

Vanessa: And inside the cocoon is the liquefied
soup of the butterfly.

Dan: And it's body liquefied and it turned
into a terrible creature.

Vanessa: How did nature-
Dan: A butterfly.

Vanessa: ... think that this would work?

But it does, it's amazing.

Wow.

So, that's my first cool fact about nature.

Dan: Cool nature factoid.

Vanessa: Yes.

Caterpillar soup.

Dan: All right.

My second is about the noble albatross.

Vanessa: Albatross are so cool.

Dan: Although if you say something is an albatross,
that kind of means it's a bad thing, or like

a burden.

It's like a saying.

Vanessa: Ah, that's kind of like an old fashioned
expression.

But-
Dan: Yeah.

But anyways, my factoid is-
Vanessa: ... it is a bird.

Dan: ... an albatross has the longest wingspan
of any bird.

Did you know that?

Almost 12 feet long, or 3.2 meters.

Vanessa: Three meters?

Dan: Something like that.

Vanessa: Three meters is so long, so that
means from the tip of one wing to the tip

of the other wing is three meters, 12 feet.

Dan: Yeah, it's a really huge bird.

Vanessa: One bird.

Dan: And actually, if you've watched any David
Attenborough documentaries-

Vanessa: Or others.

Dan: ... we watched one with the albatross,
it needs to take a really long run before

it flies, because its wings are so huge-
Vanessa: Like a huge airplane, it needs a

lot of runway to get off.

Dan: But there's a lot of other animals.

What was it in the documentary that was trying
to get them?

Vanessa: It was the babies.

Dan: Oh, sharks.

Vanessa: Yes.

Dan: Because they would crash in the water
and the sharks would eat them.

Vanessa: When the babies were first learning
how to fly, a lot of them crash in the water,

and I think they do it the same time every
year, so sharks gather there-

Dan: They wait for the babies.

Vanessa: ... and as the babies are learning
to fly, if they fail on their first try, that's

it.

Dan: Yeah, they can't make it.

Vanessa: Anyway, that was a really sad part
of the documentary.

Dan: But once they actually get in the air,
an albatross can stay in the air for up to

10,000 miles, which is a lot of kilometers.

Vanessa: 6,000, 7,000 kilometers?

Dan: Yeah, I'm not so good with those conversions
that everybody else uses.

Vanessa: Yeah, and I remember you also told
me that they could fly for-

Dan: A day.

Vanessa: ... a whole day with just one [inaudible
00:47:30].

Dan: Just one flap of their wings.

Vanessa: If they have the right wind, because
they go off into the ocean.

Dan: Yeah, it requires good wind.

Vanessa: Yeah.

Dan: Because they just use the wind to bounce
up and down.

Vanessa: So they only need to flap their wings
one time per day, if there is good wind.

Dan: It'd be a very lonely existence, just
flying over the ocean.

Vanessa: But talking about lonely, they also
mate for life.

Dan: That's lonely?

Vanessa: Well, no, that's crazy because they...

most birds are not like that, so they go off
alone into the ocean to hunt, and then once

a year they come back to the same place and
they hope that their husband or wife, their

mate, has survived also.

Dan: And then they promptly cheat on them.

Vanessa: Well, they are not monogamous.

Dan: They have partners that they regularly
come back to, but then they also go and flirt

with other birds.

Vanessa: Other birds as well, but they have
the same main partner for their whole lives,

and they only see them once a year, but they
find each other at that same... on the same

rock, on the same land, every... albatross
are really cool.

Dan: [crosstalk 00:48:34] kisses.

Vanessa: Yeah.

Yeah, you should look up some videos about
albatross, they're really cool.

Well, one of my other cool facts-
Dan: What's your last factoid?

Vanessa: ... my last cool fact is about a
mantis shrimp.

Dan: The mantis shrimp.

Vanessa: We think about shrimp as the thing
that we eat, but the mantis shrimp is really

different.

I'll show you a picture here.

The mantis shrimp is an insane animal.

It has the best visual senses of any animal,
including humans.

I looked this up to make sure I could explain
it correctly.

Humans have three photoreceptors in our eyes.

How many do you think the mantis shrimp have?

Dan: 10.

Vanessa: 12 to 16.

So this means they can see infrared, they
can see ultraviolet, they can see every possible

thing that's coming through the light spectrum.

It is crazy.

Dan: Basically thank god it's not huge and
lives on land, because it would kill us.

Vanessa: Yes, this and it can also punch through,
it has the-

Dan: Look how it's hand's like this.

Vanessa: Yes, they're like this.

It can punch through bulletproof glass that
is 1 centimeter thick.

So it's almost impossible to keep a mantis
shrimp in an aquarium because-

Dan: Because it will break the glass.

Vanessa: ... they're so strong... it's just
a shrimp, they're small, but it can punch

through bullet proof glass, and most aquariums
don't have bullet proof glass, it's less than

that.

Dan: Why not?

Vanessa: But it will punch through the glass
and get out, so they can see everything, and

they also can punch through the glass, which
is absolutely insane.

There's a lot of really cool videos-
Dan: And they look cool too.

Vanessa: Yeah, colors, and their big eyes.

Dan: Yeah, beautiful.

You should share the comic about it too.

There's a popular comic in America called
The Oatmeal.

Vanessa: It's a website.

Dan: Yeah, it's a website.

And they have a whole story about the mantis
shrimp.

Vanessa: Yeah, there's a good YouTube video
too, about the mantis shrimp.

Dan: About it?

Oh.

Vanessa: I think it's... who's that guy who
does kind of funny stuff about animals who's

like, "That's how the mantis shrimp do."

Dan: Oh, zefrank.

Vanessa: Zefrank, yes.

Dan: Look up zefrank for a good laugh.

Vanessa: Just look up mantis shrimp on YouTube,
you'll find many great things because those

animals are cool.

All right, we had a chance to be nerdy, let's
go on to the next topic, and I want to know

for you, do you know any cool animal facts?

Dan: Yeah.

Vanessa: All right, let's go to the next topic.

The next topic is holidays.

And it is the end of November-ish, which is
Thanksgiving time in the U.S., so I want to

know, in your experience, what is Thanksgiving
like in the U.S.?

Dan: In the U.S., well it's pretty much just
an American holiday, right?

Vanessa: Yeah.

Dan: Or Canadian, I suppose.

Vanessa: Canada also has Thanksgiving.

Dan: So for Thanksgiving, the primary thing
that we do is eat food.

Vanessa: Okay, next topic.

Dan: The end.

Vanessa: Oh, yeah, it's pretty much all about
food.

Dan: It's really all about the food, especially
turkey.

Vanessa: So tell us about food on Thanksgiving.

Dan: Pretty much everybody gets a turkey.

Vanessa: A big, full turkey.

Dan: Yeah, there must be this huge spike in
turkey sales in November in the U.S.

Vanessa: Oh, yeah.

Dan: But everybody gets a turkey, you cook
the whole turkey, and you get gravy, and you

pour it on there, and there's something called
stuffing as well, which is this bread pudding

kind of thing, I guess.

Vanessa: Yeah, well, you have it inside the
turkey, usually you cook some seasonings,

and lemons, and breads, and all different
types of things inside the turkey.

Dan: Some may argue that the stuffing is better
than the turkey.

Vanessa: Yeah, sometimes it is.

Dan: I'm one of those people-
Vanessa: Stuff is great.

Dan: ... I just eat the stuffing.

Vanessa: It's really full of turkey juices,
so it's kind of like a breaded mixture, I'll

try to share a picture, but stuffing, turkey.

Dan: So the holiday is really just centered
around the meal, and then you invite lots

of family over.

Vanessa: Yes.

Dan: And usually one family member will host
a lot of family, I find.

Vanessa: Yeah.

Dan: And sometimes friends as well, but like
your dad has been doing friends for the last

few years.

Vanessa: Yeah.

Dan: But traditionally, it's only family.

Vanessa: Yeah, I think this is definitely
more a family holiday, that you say goodbye

to your friends, go back home wherever you
came from, if you live far away from your

parents, maybe you'll go back home and have
Thanksgiving at their home, or maybe they'll

come visit you.

It's kind of a time for families to come back
together during Thanksgiving.

Dan: Yeah.

And if you are a very bonded family, then
you always say what you're thankful for.

Vanessa: Oh.

Dan: So every year my family would always
say something they're thankful for around

the table.

And usually when I was a kid I remember being
like-

Vanessa: "I don't want to do this."

Dan: "I don't want..." but now I'm like, "I'm
thankful for everybody and everything in my

family.

It's so beautiful."

Get a little more sentimental when you get
older.

Vanessa: Yeah.

Well, back to the food, we're kind of talking
about the traditions now, but back to the

food, the typical things are a big turkey
bird, a full bird, you don't have just slices

of turkey, you have the full bird and then
you cut it up.

Dan: Yeah.

Vanessa: And then stuffing, green beans is
common with gravy, mashed potatoes, sweet

potatoes, in the south of the U.S., sweet
potato casserole is really big.

This is insane-
Dan: With brown sugar on it.

Vanessa: ... it's insanely sweet because it's
sweet potatoes, which are orange and already

pretty sweet naturally, then brown sugar,
and then-

Dan: Marshmallows, right?

Vanessa: ... marshmallows, for dinner.

Dan: Oh, I forgot about that.

Vanessa: Crazy, but-
Dan: I always eat like this much of that because

it's too sweet.

Vanessa: It's really rich, but that's kind
of a southern thing, and you also always have

cranberry sauce.

Dan: Right.

Vanessa: This is... a cranberry is a really
tart berry, it's so tart, it's really sour,

but when you mix it with a lot of sugar, it's
great.

Dan: And you need mashed potatoes.

Vanessa: Yeah, so the cranberries, and the
mashed potatoes, and the turkey, it's a perfect

combination.

That kind of tart flavors with the mashed
potatoes with the turkey, it kind of mixes

together really great.

Dan: Yeah, basically the point is to eat so
much you can barely move at the end of the

day.

Vanessa: Well, they do say that turkey, the
bird, the turkey meat, has some kind of-

Dan: Tryptophan.

Vanessa: Is that what it's called?

Dan: I think so.

Vanessa: That kind of enzyme in it.

Isn't it enzyme?

Hormone, or-
Dan: Chemical?

Vanessa: It has something in the meat naturally
that makes you feel sleepy, so at Thanksgiving

that's really one of the only times when we
eat turkey, so because we eat so much turkey,

it's kind of stereotypical to say after the
Thanksgiving meal everyone crashes on the

couch and watches football.

So it's kind of a tradition.

Dan: Yeah, football is probably the most American
aspect of this.

Vanessa: Yeah.

Dan: They don't really play football in other
countries, do they?

Vanessa: Well, this is American football.

Dan: I mean, not... yeah, not-
Vanessa: American football.

Dan: ... real football, like you know, not
kicking the ball.

Vanessa: Soccer.

Dan: Football like, we throw the ball, and
we tackle each other, and stuff.

Vanessa: Yeah, so there are... there's always
a football, an American football game on Thanksgiving,

so that's why some of the sayings abut Thanksgiving
is the three Fs, family, food, football.

When I was growing up, my family would eat
Thanksgiving, and then we often would go to

the living room and watch football together,
even though we weren't big football fans.

It's kind of just-
Dan: It's just tradition.

Vanessa: ... what you do.

So we would say what we were thankful for,
and then-

Dan: It's the American religion.

Vanessa: ... watch football, and that was
just kind of a family time together.

I don't know.

Did you guys ever do anything?

Sometimes we threw a football in backyard.

Dan: Yeah, a few years we would throw the
football.

Our family didn't watch that much football.

Vanessa: Yeah-
Dan: We would sometimes, just like the Superbowl,

that's all.

Vanessa: Yeah.

Yeah, so I'm curious, for you, in your country,
do you have any fall meal holiday that's really

centered around food?

Dan: Yeah, we should also say, I think it's
supposed to also traditionally be you feast

on all the food that you grew.

Vanessa: Yeah, but most people are not farmers
nowadays.

Dan: Yeah, but I think traditionally it does
have that element of, "The harvest is in.

We come and eat all this delicious food.

It was a good year."

Vanessa: "We're thankful for the good harvest."

Dan: "We're thankful for the good harvest."

So maybe a lot of countries have something
like that.

Vanessa: Yeah.

All right.

Let's go to the next topic.

The next topic is relaxation.

I want to know, if I were feeling stressed,
what tips would you give me to help me feel

relaxed?

Dan: If you were feeling stressed?

Vanessa: Yeah.

Dan: Well, I don't know if this would work
for everyone, but I find that playing a sport,

or doing something active that requires some
concentration, really helps me not be stressed,

like if I'm concerned about something I like
to go and maybe play some basketball, where

your only goal is to put the ball in the hoop,
it's just something very simple and you're

using your body, which is different from how
a lot of people live today, which is very

stationary and thinking about all kinds of
problems and then looking at your phone and

reading about more problems.

Everything's a big problem it seems like.

Vanessa: So if you get out and move your body-
Dan: So if you get out and you move your body-

Vanessa: ... in the real world, yeah.

Dan: Yeah, and it could just be a hike, a
hike or something.

Vanessa: Yeah.

Dan: But yeah, I like to go and play basketball,
or maybe play some hockey, I like to do that

too, just shoot the puck around, it's a lot
of fun.

Vanessa: Some kind of organized activity.

Dan: Yeah.

Vanessa: Like shooting hoops, playing hockey-
Dan: And it doesn't even have to be with people,

just practicing, doing some kind of routine
like that.

Vanessa: I said something similar, which was
just to go for a walk, because that's not

necessarily organized, but sometimes getting
out of the place where I'm at, getting out

of the house, getting out of wherever I'm
feeling stressed, just changing locations,

and having the open sky-
Dan: Just getting outside.

Vanessa: ... breathing some cool air, or maybe
really hot air, depending on what time of

the year it is.

Dan: That's true, it depends on where you
live.

Outside might be a little too hot, or too
cold.

Vanessa: But it's just nice to kind of remove
yourself, and move, and take a walk.

Even say, "Okay, I'm going to walk for five
minutes, and I'm going to turn around and

walk five minutes back."

Sometimes 10 minutes can make a big difference.

At least it can help me feel more relaxed,
or at least more realistic about my stress.

Dan: Definitely.

Vanessa: Like if something's stressing me,
maybe I shouldn't really be stressed about

it, so taking a walk helps me to kind of recenter
myself.

Dan: Yes.

Vanessa: And think, "It's not a big deal,
it's fine.

I'll just work it out."

Dan: Okay.

And the next thing I would do, is take a shower.

Vanessa: Oh, okay.

Dan: Well, I take night time showers, so I
don't know, I just find, for me, when I'm

getting clean, and not really... and like
it's kind of that same thing, I'm just like

washing my arms, washing my hair, and I find
my mind kind of drifting, and it's nice and

warm.

I don't know, for me, maybe most people probably
would say taking a bath, but I don't really

like to take a bath.

Vanessa: Taking a shower, I've heard too that
when you're taking a shower, sometimes that's

when your best ideas happen, because you have
no stimulation, there's nothing around you,

you're just in the shower, so your mind can
really be blank, or you can really kind of

decompress in a different way.

I feel like that too, taking a shower feels
good.

Dan: Yeah, a nice, warm shower.

And then finally, sleeping.

Vanessa: Yes.

Dan: Going to sleep, getting good enough sleep.

I mean, especially nowadays where everybody
has some kind of electronics device where

you're staring at a screen, I think that doesn't
really help your stress levels go down.

Vanessa: Don't watch this video at 2:00 AM,
if it's 2:00 AM in the morning-

Dan: Yeah, stop watching.

Vanessa: ... turn it off.

Dan: Got to bed.

Vanessa: You can watch this in the morning.

Dan: So yeah, that would be the last thing
I would do, too.

Lower the stress in my life and relax.

Vanessa: Yeah, I think getting good sleep
is a really good tip, that was one of the

ones that I wrote down.

Is just-
Dan: So we share a few.

Vanessa: ... yeah, to get better sleep because
sometimes I feel like we want to blame other

parts of our lives when we feel stressed,
but when you look at the basics, "Have I been

eating healthy?

Did I drink enough water today?"

And the main one, "Did I sleep enough?"

Probably not, at least in my case, if I feel
stressed or anxious, a lot of that's because

my body can't handle what's happening in daily
life, because I haven't been treating myself

well.

Dan: Yep.

Vanessa: So if I sleep better, whether that's
consistent sleep, or a longer period of sleep,

just doing that will help me to feel less
stressed during the day.

Dan: It is situational though, some people
need more or less sleep than other people.

Vanessa: Yeah, so that's why I said get better
sleep.

Dan: Better sleep, for you.

Vanessa: Whatever is better for you.

But one thing I mentioned that you didn't
say, you kind of said, but is to take a tech

break.

And a tech break, we often use this term in
our relationship to say, "Today we are not

going to... we're just going to put away our
phones, we're not going to do anything with

any electronics today at all."

And it seems like it's a simple, easy thing
to do, but it feels good just to take a little

break, especially if that is stressing you
out, or if you're kind of avoiding dealing

with problems by looking at your phone.

I think a lot of use social media, or reading
articles-

Dan: The phones and tablets are really bad,
I think, because they're so easy-

Vanessa: Yeah, to get distracted.

Dan: ... to pick up and just keep using.

There's little games, and YouTube, which you
may be on right now.

Vanessa: Yes.

I find myself-
Dan: So keep watching.

Vanessa: ... when I feel stressed, sometimes
I don't don't want to think about it, so I'll

watch a YouTube vide, and then 30 minutes
later, I'll realize I still feel stressed.

Dan: 10 YouTube videos later.

Vanessa: Oh, yeah.

Or maybe for this one it's a couple hours
later.

Dan: Hey, I have a bonus tip.

Vanessa: Oh, bonus tip.

All right.

Dan: Yeah, a bonus tip.

Vanessa: What's your bonus tip?

Dan: I don't really meditate, but I've heard
mediation is very great for de-stressing.

Vanessa: I'm curious if any of you have tried
meditation.

Dan: So I would also recommend meditating,
but for me, I actually tried something that

was kind of similar, I counted my breaths.

So this was actually kind of to help me fall
asleep, but a lot of times I can't fall asleep

because I'm thinking about the day and feeling
stressed.

Vanessa: You can't turn your mind off.

Dan: So basically the idea that I heard was
to breathe in for 10 seconds.

Vanessa: Okay.

Dan: No, no, no, breathe in for five seconds,
then breathe out for 10 seconds.

Vanessa: Oh.

Dan: So you're kind of counting one, two,
three, four, five.

And then, one, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, 10.

And just only thinking about your breaths.

Vanessa: Okay.

Dan: You know, it really kind of puts the
focus somewhere else, and you're breathing

in deeply, which a lot of us do not breathe
in deeply, so it helps you to breathe in more

deeply and concentrate on your breathing.

Vanessa: Yeah, I heard that one of the side
effects of using a computer a lot, or a phone

a lot, is that when they study people who
are looking at a screen, we blink less-

Dan: What?

Vanessa: ... so our eyes are open, they're
getting kind of red and dry, and our breathing

increases.

So we're kind of like-
Dan: They're just like shallow?

Vanessa: Yeah, like... we're just not focused,
like maybe feel a little bit of stress, or

we're just not focused slow and-
Dan: On our bodies.

Vanessa: ... relaxed.

Yeah.

So those long-term effects, if you're doing
that for several hours a day, without thinking

about it, it can affect your body, so breathing,
yeah, slowly, can help to kind of help you

feel less stressed.

Dan: There you go.

Vanessa: Wow.

Dan: That's my most practical tip.

Vanessa: Bonus tip.

So I'm curious for you, what are some tips
you would give to help someone feel less stress

in their life?

To feel more relaxed?

What would you say?

All right.

Let's go to the next topic.

The next topic is sports and exercise, so
I want to know when you were a kid, what kind

of sports or activities did you participate
in?

Dan: Man, I played a lot of sports.

Vanessa: Yeah?

Dan: Yeah, I think it kind of shows the privilege
we grew up in, that we had so many opportunities

to try so many different things.

Vanessa: That was really lucky to be able
to do that kind of stuff.

Dan: So first I started out with baseball,
but it was called t-ball, so you actually

put the ball on a tee, and you put the ball
there, and you just hit it off of it.

Vanessa: So no one's throwing the ball.

Dan: Yeah, I was really little.

Vanessa: It's just stationary.

Dan: And I actually remember when the coaches
started pitching to me, I got kind of scared

of the ball and I didn't want to play anymore.

Vanessa: It's a big deal.

Dan: Yeah, I was really little, so I stopped
playing that and I started playing soccer.

Vanessa: Oh, okay.

Dan: And swimming as well.

So you call it, probably football in your
country, but it's interesting, many, many

children, play soccer in America.

Vanessa: Yeah, I think it's easy to get into
because you just are running and kicking a

ball.

Dan: Sure.

Vanessa: There's no equipment or specialized
movements-

Dan: Right.

Vanessa: ... at least for kids.

Dan: But for some reason, it's not a popular
sport to watch.

Vanessa: Or for adults, a lot of adults don't
play soccer.

Dan: Adults don't play soccer that much, it's
just children.

Vanessa: Yeah.

Dan: But I played soccer for probably like
six year.

Vanessa: Oh.

Dan: And then I never played it again.

Yeah.

Vanessa: Just as a kid.

Dan: Yep.

So I did that, and I did swimming, and gymnastics
for a while.

I had a phase where I used to like to do a
lot of flips-

Vanessa: Oh, cool.

Dan: ... so I would jump on the trampoline
and do back flips and front flips.

Vanessa: In a gymnasium that's like a gymnastics
center.

Dan: Yeah, but also in my backyard.

We had a trampoline.

Vanessa: Ah, cool.

Dan: So I would do that, and then I did figure
skating where we were doing spinning and stuff.

Vanessa: I did figure skating too.

Dan: Yes.

And then my brother convinced me to take up
a more manly sport, hockey.

Vanessa: Oh, it's a shame, you probably would
have been really good at figure skating.

Dan: Yeah, I was all right, but-
Vanessa: Yeah.

I think that's the kind of thing that-
Dan: ... it wasn't my true love-

Vanessa: Like hockey?

Dan: ... that would be hockey.

Vanessa: Well, I'm glad that you found your
true love, hockey.

Dan: I do love hockey, but I don't really
have the build for it, I'm a little too small,

but I still had a lot of fun playing hockey.

Vanessa: Yeah, and you still play hockey.

Dan: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

Vanessa: You play on a team here in our city.

Dan: That's not all of my sports-
Vanessa: I feel like as a... you had a lot

of organized sports as a kid-
Dan: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

Vanessa: ... and maybe that's just because
you have a older brother, or just something

that you wanted to do, but I feel like for
me-

Dan: I think my dad thought it was good for
me too.

Vanessa: Oh.

Dan: Which I think is true, it's good for
kids to get into organized sports.

Vanessa: Sure.

Sure.

I feel like for me as a kid I didn't do team
sports as much, like we just played in the

backyard a lot.

Dan: Weren't you kind of a timid child, too?

Vanessa: I wouldn't say I was timid, but I
didn't like physical contact with other kids,

so basketball for me was really physically
aggressive.

Dan: Too rough.

Vanessa: Yeah, a little too rough, I didn't
really like that.

Dan: You should try hockey.

Vanessa: That's very rough.

But I loved swimming, so I think that swimming
was probably the main sport of my childhood,

and through high school every summer my sister
and I were on a swim team, and that meant

that every day, twice a day, we would go to
swim practice, and I-

Dan: Vanessa's a really good swimmer, she
can kick my butt.

Vanessa: Not literally, that is a figurative
expression.

That means I can swim better than Dan, which
is true.

Dan: It's true.

Vanessa: But it just means that I know the
technique, and if Dan or you-

Dan: I'm out there like struggling.

Vanessa: ... if you know the right technique,
you can have a lot of endurance because you're

not wasting your energy, so I feel like I
learned the right technique, so I can swim

longer because I know the right technique
because I practiced it a lot.

So we would always swim, and then we'd have
swim competitions, which are called swim meets,

and that was a fun part of my childhood growing,
was swimming, kind of this... it's kind of

a team thing, but not really.

You have a team, but you're still individual.

Dan: So like combined scores, is that how
it works?

Vanessa: Well, you would be... you're part
of the community team, like your community,

your neighborhood is the team, but then each
person has an individual score.

Dan: Score.

Vanessa: So it's kid of a team, kid of individual,
and I liked that.

And it was not physically aggressive.

Dan: That would make me so nervous.

Vanessa: Yeah.

Dan: These individual sports, I feel the pressure
way too much.

If I were swimming and racing, I'd be so scared.

But when I play a sport like basketball, you're
on a team, and so you're kind of depending

on each other more, it's not all up to you.

Vanessa: Yeah.

Dan: Although, if you make a big mistake,
then everybody's looking at you.

Vanessa: Yeah.

Dan: That's no fun.

Vanessa: Yeah, I feel like I like having a
team, but at the same time, I like having

kind of your own thing going on, you can kind
of be more individualistic.

Dan: Yeah.

Vanessa: So I'm curious for you, growing up
did you play organized sports like Dan?

I also did some volleyball in high school,
those types of things, kind of organized sports.

But did you play organized sports like that,
or did you just play with your friends in

the neighborhood, like I did growing up with
my friends in the neighborhood?

What kind of activities, or exercise type
things did you do when you were a child?

All right, let's go to the next topic.

The next topic is electronics, this is another
hypothetical, maybe a dream type question,

but I want to know if you could upgrade any
electronics in your life for no price, it's

free, what would you like to upgrade in your
life?

Dan: Interesting.

Yeah, I feel like I'm pretty satisfied with
our electronic status.

Vanessa: Oh, okay.

Dan: Electronics status.

Yeah, because you know me.

I already upgrade my electronics quite freely.

Vanessa: Dan likes electronics.

Dan: I do, especially like speakers and music.

I love music, so I buy a lot of headphones,
and a lot speakers, and stuff like this.

And every time I'm about to buy something
like that she looks at me like, "Why are you

buying another thing like this?"

I haven't bought too much-
Vanessa: Yeah, it's not too much.

Dan: ... but I just tend to browse, and sometimes
I look at these humongous speakers that would

fill an opera room, or something, and I'm
like, "These would be awesome to have."

Vanessa: And then I need to remind Dan that
we don't live in a house the size of a football

field, like his dream.

Dan: But in my dream house-
Vanessa: Someday when we have that dream house,

right?

Dan: ... it will have those speakers, yes.

Vanessa: What would you like to upgrade if
you could do it for no price?

Dan: Yeah, so right now it would be a laptop.

Vanessa: Oh, yeah, your laptop just broke.

Dan: Yeah, so our son, Theo, decided to step
on my laptop.

And it still actually works pretty well, but
it snapped in half, so somehow it's still

working, but it's old anyways.

Vanessa: Yeah, it's his fault, but you know,
you shouldn't have left it on the floor.

Dan: Yeah, so I'll probably update my laptop
soon, which is a very doable thing nowadays.

Vanessa: Okay.

Yeah, you could get a laptop that isn't broken
in half.

Dan: Yeah, and the second thing is actually
something we've never had before, which would

be a security system.

Vanessa: Oh.

Dan: It sounds like you would only want this
in a neighborhood where you would-

Vanessa: You feel kind of dangerous.

Yeah.

Dan: ... you feel like you're in danger.

But I still feel like it would just kind of
add comfort to me.

Vanessa: Okay.

Dan: We've always lived in apartments where
they had a gate, or a front door, where-

Vanessa: You have other people around you.

Dan: ... and you have other people around
you, you're not like just such a solo target.

Because in America, you're just living in
a house in neighborhood, and it's like standalone,

so I'd like to get some cameras, and something
I could check on the house and make sure everything's

okay.

And just for peace of mind mostly.

Vanessa: Okay.

Yeah, I feel like our neighborhood's not dangerous
at all.

Dan: It's very safe, yeah.

Vanessa: But even if you leave to go away
for a week, and you want to be able to see

outside the house, that could be helpful,
yeah.

Dan: Yeah, and in modern times there's a lot
of really good security systems out there.

Vanessa: Yeah, that could be helpful.

I feel like, for me, my answer to this is-
Dan: This shows how much Vanessa cares about

electronics.

Vanessa: I had to think about this for a long
time, because I don't really care about electronics

that much-
Dan: I always choose the electronics, I bought

her computer.

I actually built her computer.

Vanessa: Yeah, Dan built the computer that
we use for editing and for doing work, but

I feel like for me something electronic that
I would like to upgrade is kind of practical,

our car that we have, you use a key to open
it, and that's fine.

Dan: What?

You use a key?

Vanessa: But it would be really great to have
a beeper button, so this is pretty typical-

Dan: This is funny because everybody in America
has this, except for us.

Vanessa: Yeah, I think if your car is newer
than 2000, so if it's within the last 20 years,

you probably have a beeper that opens the
car door.

Some really new cars have a beeper that turns
on the car, I don't need that, I just would

like a beeper that can open the door, because
we have a two year old and soon we will have

another child, and opening the car on one
side, going to the other, putting him in the

car, coming back, unlocking it, it seems so-
Dan: Yeah, we never realized how much we'd

appreciate this.

Vanessa: Yeah, I would really appreciate this
small convenience.

Dan: I mean, our car should have this, but
we bought it used, and the person who sold

us the car lost those keys.

Vanessa: Yeah, they only had the regular key.

Dan: Yeah.

Vanessa: So do you think that it's possible,
because that existed before, could we do this?

Dan: Yes, it's very easy.

Vanessa: Oh, really?

Dan: Yeah, we have to go to the dealership
and ask them, and they have to calibrate it.

Vanessa: And we have to just buy more keys?

My dream is going to come true.

Dan: We could make this happen.

Vanessa: Okay.

Dan: But I think at the time when I asked
the dealership about that, we had just bought

the car, and it was pretty expensive, and
we didn't really have that much money, and

I was like, "We can't afford to get the keys
too."

Vanessa: Sure, because we decided to pay for
the car outright.

Dan: Right.

But it's definitely doable, this very simple
fix in your life.

Vanessa: Wow, dreams come true right here
on YouTube, thank you.

Well, I'm curious for you, if you could upgrade,
or if you could have some electronics completely

for free with no price added, what would you
like to upgrade in your life?

I'm curious.

Let us know.

All right.

Let's go to the last topic.

Our final topic is money.

I want to know, what are three purchases that
you regret?

Three things that were not worth it.

Dan: That I regret.

Not three things I love?

Vanessa: No, what were three purchases that
after you bought it you said, "Ah, I shouldn't

have bought this."

Dan: Oh, okay, so regretful purchases.

Vanessa: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

Dan: Well, the first one I can think of kind
of checks all of the boxes as something you

regret.

Because in the first place, you didn't want
me to buy this.

Vanessa: Because it was-
Dan: Expensive.

Vanessa: ... headphones.

We were talking about music devices.

Dan: We were talking about it.

Yes.

I already had headphones that I listen to
all the time-

Vanessa: That he loves.

Dan: ... so I was already getting the judgment
feelings from Vanessa, but I thought maybe

I wanted something with even better sound,
maybe a different kind of sound.

I was looking for the new sound.

Vanessa: But what happened?

Dan: We didn't have very much money at this
time either, so-

Vanessa: Ah, that was another layer.

Dan: ... I bought these over $100 headphones,
and we took them home, and they started hurting

my ears-
Vanessa: Because they were kind of-

Dan: ... they were just painful.

Vanessa: ... they were like noise canceling
headphones?

Dan: No, it's like they're on ear, they just,
they weren't really build to listen to as

long as I do.

Vanessa: Okay.

Dan: So they hurt my ears, and I was like,
"Oh, no.

They're hurting my ears, this is really bad."

Vanessa: "I can't tell Vanessa."

Dan: "I can't."

Yeah.

But then also, we bought them in South Korea,
and the place that I bought them had a no

return policy, so I couldn't return them.

Vanessa: And then what happened?

Dan: And then I brought them home, and I sat
them down, and our cat walked up to them and

bit the cord and just broke them.

Vanessa: Yes, within five minutes.

Dan: Within five minutes.

No, like five seconds.

The second I sat the headphones down, the
cat bit them.

Vanessa: And it was the kind of cord that
you can't just take out and replace it, you

have to do some... you have to send it into
the company and pay a lot to get it fixed.

Dan: Well, I didn't know how to fix it.

I think my dad actually fixed it later and
he used them.

Vanessa: Oh, that's good.

Dan: So there you go, it actually worked out
in the end.

Vanessa: Wow.

But yeah, there was a couple layers of regret.

Dan: Yeah, there was a lot of layers of regret,
and then the cat bit the cord anyway.

Vanessa: Ah, and that's something that we
should have known.

We should have put them up somewhere, you
could have put them somewhere else, but it

just kind of was icing on the cake.

Dan: Yeah.

Vanessa: Which means, it was one more thing.

Dan: Now I can't even use them.

Because I was like hoping, "Oh, some day maybe
they'll be more comfortable.

Maybe they'll just feel better, I'll get used
to them."

Vanessa: But then you can't even use them
because our cat bit the cord.

Dan: Yep.

Vanessa: Well, that's a regretful purchase.

Dan: There you go, there's a whole story behind
that.

Vanessa: Yeah, can I say one of mine first?

Dan: Go ahead.

Yes.

Vanessa: Okay.

One of mine is much smaller, but it is anytime
that I buy tea at Starbucks, always a bad

decision.

Dan: Sorry, Starbucks.

Vanessa: Yeah, but I don't like coffee, and
if I go to Starbucks that's the only drink

that I can drink, because they have a lot
of coffee stuff, a lot of sweet stuff, but

one tea bag at Starbucks, you're just buying
a tea bag with hot water, they're not making

anything-
Dan: Fancy.

Vanessa: ... it's not a specialized drink.

It's just hot water and a tea bag, and it's
like $2.50, or something.

Like $2.50 just for a bag of tea.

And you can buy a whole box of tea for the
same price.

Dan: By the way, this is the difference between
Vanessa and I, is that I would never sweat

a purchase like that.

Vanessa: Well for me it's the taste.

It's not necessarily the price, the price
is high for tea, but the taste is never worth

it.

It's just mediocre tea, it's not even that
great.

Dan: I'd still never regret it.

Vanessa: Yeah, well-
Dan: I don't regret cheap purchases, I never

think about it.

Vanessa: I feel like for me it's just annoying
because I want to have a cool drink if I'm

going to a coffee shop, but then it's just
a tea bag in water.

It's not even loose leaf tea.

Anyway, I'm a tea snob, so let's go to yours.

Dan: That's true.

All right, the next in my list could be actually
a category in and of itself, but the most

recent occurrence was when we went to a place
on our beach vacation called The Turtle Museum.

Vanessa: Oh.

Dan: And it sounded all fancy, but it was
probably $15 bucks a person to get in.

Vanessa: Yeah, it was like a turtle rehabilitation
center.

Dan: Yeah, but there was just one room with
some pictures on the wall, and then we thought

we were going to see turtles up close and
personal, but they were just in big swimming

pools and you could barely see them.

Vanessa: Were they breathing out of their
butts?

Dan: They probably were at the time.

Vanessa: No, they're sea turtles.

Dan: You're right, they weren't breathing
out of their butts.

And so I was just disappointed with the whole
experience and didn't think it was worth it.

Although, that was a little different because
I felt like I was donating because they rescue

turtles, but there are a lot of places that
are like this, like a museum, or some kind

of show that maybe you pay a up front cost,
and then the show or the museum is just not

very good, or boring.

Vanessa: Yeah, like have you ever traveled
somewhere and you paid to enter a museum,

or you paid to enter some building and it
just wasn't worth it.

I feel like that's happened a lot, and that's
just the most recent for us, is that, "Okay,

I feel okay because I donated some money to
that turtle rehabilitation center."

But we didn't really get to see turtles in
the way that we wanted to.

Dan: I wanted to touch a turtle.

Vanessa: Oh, but they are in a hospital, they're
being rehabilitated.

Dan: That's true, it was a turtle hospital.

Vanessa: Yeah.

Do you have any other-
Dan: But it sounded way cooler-

Vanessa: Oh, yeah.

Yeah, it did sound cool.

"Go to the turtle center and see the turtles."

Dan: Yeah, my last thing is just a small thing.

I bought some t-shirts online, and it's kind
of iffy to buy clothes online, but I always

felt like I like the picture that was on them,
but then the quality of the shirt wasn't very

good or-
Vanessa: Especially when it's online, you

can't feel it.

Dan: ... it didn't fit that well.

Yeah, not a great idea.

I've regretted some of those purchases.

Vanessa: Another thing that I feel like I've
bought that wasn't worth it, this is a general

category, but it's some toys for our, now
he's two year old, but throughout his short

life, some toys that I bought for him that
I thought he'd like, because he played with

at a friend's house, or I just thought it
would be cool, but he didn't really like it.

For example, there's this thing that was...
it's like a bead maze, and I remember liking

this as a kid, which is why I got it-
Dan: I thought he played with that.

Vanessa: Not really, he kind of wanted to
just pull the beads off, but he couldn't play

with.

But I remember I played with it as a kid,
and I found it at a second hand store.

It was like $10, it wasn't that much, but
I thought he'd play with it.

I was like, "This is it.

He's going to play with this for so long,
it's going to be great."

And he just never really played with it.

So I feel like-
Dan: This will probably be an ongoing problem.

Vanessa: Yeah.

So now I-
Dan: Now that we have kids.

Vanessa: I've tried to kind of back up and
think, "Okay, he likes to play with these

three things.

If other people want to give him presents,
and give him other toys, that's fine, but

I'm not really going to invest in more toys
because he kind of likes the same things all

the time."

Dan: Legos, legos, legos.

Vanessa: Legos, legos, legos.

Sometimes Play-Doh, sometimes the sandbox.

Dan: But mostly legos.

Vanessa: But generally the same couple toys
again, and again, and again.

So I'm curious for you, what are some purchases
that you've made that weren't worth it, that

you regretted?

This video is free on YouTube, so this is
not a purchase.

I hope that you have not regretted spending
your time, though, with us.

Dan: Yeah, I know what you wouldn't regret,
purchasing the Fearless Fluency Club.

Vanessa: Oh.

Well-
Dan: There's a pitch for you.

Vanessa: This is our monthly English course
where we teach about a different topic every

month, and you learn the vocabulary, phrasal
verbs, pronunciation.

We have a private Facebook group where a lot
of members meet together and talk together

to practice speaking English.

And once a month I have a group Google hangout
and we talk together.

Just a great way to expand your English and
be able to learn more.

So if you enjoyed our conversation today-
Dan: Yeah, and one might say, "Become fluent."

Vanessa: Yes, I hope so, become more confident.

Well, thank you so much for joining me today.

Dan: You're welcome.

We're done?

Vanessa: Wow, this was a lot.

Dan: Can you believe it?

Did you make it all the way though?

Vanessa: If you made it this far, congratulations.

Pat yourself on the back.

We asked a lot of questions today, so I'm
going to put those in the description below,

so that you can go to each topic if you want
to go back and watch a certain topic, or if

you saw some vocabulary appear that you'd
like to review and practice, you can always

go back and review what we talked about.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask,
and make sure that you write a comment and

answer some of these questions yourself, use
English.

Dan: Yes.

Vanessa: Thank you so much for joining me,
Dan.

Dan: You're welcome.

It was very enjoyable.

Vanessa: Yes, I appreciate your time.

Dan: It was a journey.

Vanessa: Your energy.

Oh, it was a journey.

Yes, we went through a lot of different topics
today.

Thank you so much as well for learning English
with me and with Dan today, I'll see you next

Friday for a new lesson here on my YouTube
channel.

Bye.

Dan: Bye.

Vanessa: The next step is to download my free
ebook, Five Steps to Becoming A Confident

English Speaker.

You'll learn what you need to do to speak
confidently and fluently.
